Blockchain Stocks Are Next! While a tiny home is great because of its low price compared to a bigger property, the limitations on space mean you must make other adjustments with how you furnish it. A certain degree of creative thinking is needed to fit in the kind of useful things that will help make the place feel homely but also not cramped at the same time. Royalty Free Photo There are also a few essentials that you’ll find you won’t want to go without regardless of space considerations. Think about how much each item weighs because one of the points of a tiny home is going minimalist in the number and the weight of all your possessions. Let’s take a look at four useful items that your tiny home cannot easily do without. Washer & Dryer Machine While it’s possible to do without the washer and dryer equipment, having to trek your dirty laundry down to the laundromat every week gets old real fast. If you don’t have a car, you’ll have to carry it over your shoulder or in a backpack which won’t be too comfortable either. It’s true that making the space for the washing in your tiny home isn’t easy, but it’s well worth it. To cut down on the floor space used, there are combination units you can buy to avoid having separate ones. Pair the washer and dryer machine with a drying rack that works both inside or outside your home (weather dependent) and you’re all set. Space Heater It might be warm enough now, but when the temperature drops you will be glad you bought a space heater to warm up the place. These products are now more energy efficient than in the past with thermostats to turn them off when the home reaches an agreeable temperature. They are also not as expensive to run as you’d think because you’re not having to heat multiple rooms; the warmth spreads around the home evenly as it radiates out. Small Refrigerator When it comes to the refrigerator, there are a good number of choices available. You can, of course, look for a tall refrigerator to take maximum advantage of the height of your home. However, these units do use considerable amounts of energy. A compact refrigerator that might even fit under a well-designed kitchen counter top is ideal because you can reach it without having to stretch up. Alternatively, installing a refrigerator under the stairs or as part of a wall are other options if you’re really trying to save space and don’t care about the unit being in the kitchen area. Composting Toilet Facility Having a toilet is a must for most tiny home owners. You don’t want to have to rely on local facilities in the dead of night when you get caught short. The composting version doesn’t use water and is environmentally friendly. It’s easy to empty on a regular basis and doesn’t take up too much space either. There’s also no black water tank, so it’s more convenient that way too. Your tiny home doesn’t need too many items to feel comfy, but there are some that we’d think are essential to your overall enjoyment. You want to avoid adding too many extras in your tiny home as the point is to live small, but there are some things you just cannot do without.", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303, "_bm25_score": 0.0, "_rank": 3, "_combined_score": 0.36210129550571724, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.6242197253433208}

He is fair in his assessment of the media which has gone over the edge in its coverage of Trump. The Hollywood reporter has excerpted part of Kurtz’s new book on the subject: How “Trump Trauma” Is Crippling the News Media (Guest Column) On Jan. 8, 2017, days before Donald Trump was to assume the crushing burdens of the presidency, he faced a very different kind of problem: Meryl Streep. The iconic actress slammed him in her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, attacking him for, among other things, having allegedly mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the campaign. The next morning, Hope Hicks, the president’s loyal young assistant who was almost always by Trump’s side, pulled out her phone to play footage of Kellyanne Conway on the CNN and Fox morning shows. Kellyanne said that charge had been repeatedly refuted and added that if Streep were so concerned about the rights of the disabled, she should have spoken out about a disabled boy who had been badly beaten by young thugs shouting anti-Trump epithets in a video that had been posted on Facebook. Trump loved that answer and started venting about his media coverage. Hicks retreated to a nearby desk, where she spoke to Times reporter Patrick Healy. He had called Trump’s cellphone during the Globes and then quoted the president-elect as saying he wasn’t surprised by criticisms from “liberal movie people.” Hicks took Healy to task.

He claims the high costs of ‘flagship’ missions are keeping other important and crucial missions stuck on the ‘drawing board.’ He says he is worried because the golden age we have been in seems to be coming to an end. Sure, no golden age lasts forever but we are putting an end to this one far too soon. There seems to be good reason behind what he is saying. Elvis wrote in Scientific American as follows: Our early successes came from looking through new windows across a vast range of wavelengths invisible to the naked eye. The first radio, X-ray, ultraviolet and infrared telescopes were small, but everything we saw through them was new and mysterious. The next generation of telescopes leaped forward in capabilities, leading to the discoveries of neutron stars, black holes, radiation left over from the big bang, dark matter, dark energy, dark energy, exoplanets … the list goes on. But this greater power came at a cost—literally since each new generation of telescopes carried a price tag several times higher than that of the one before. Today, a single telescope can now take almost a full decade’s worth of NASA’s budget for “Big Astronomy.” The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), now scheduled for launch next year, takes the prize at about $8 billion. The glory of our golden age has been that we can access the whole electromagnetic spectrum at the same time. The discovery of gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars is a perfect example: ground-based detectors spotted these ripples in spacetime, but follow-up observations with gamma-ray, X-ray and visible-light telescopes gave us a far more complete understanding of how the event unfolded. Ideally, we need several comparably sensitive “flagship” telescopes, on a par with JWST, and they need to be flying at the same time. Yet such flagships are only designed to last about five years (although that can often be stretched to 10). When the infrared-sensitive JWST flies, it will be 10 to 100 times more powerful than its predecessors, the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. But if new flagships cost as much as JWST, it will be a decade before even one can be launched. By that time JWST itself will likely be on its last legs. So every discovery made by the Webb telescope will take over a decade to follow up. By then, we’ll have forgotten what it was that we wanted to know in the first place. Advances in astronomy will slow to a snail’s pace. Elvis says that the way we respond to crises like this make a huge difference in how things go down. He noted that we do not have to simply accept this. We can respond in a different manner and change the outcome. He believes a new program needs to be put in place and it should be one requiring multiple new missions. You can read his full article by clicking here or in the video below.

Do you think it’s time to get defensive, go to cash, favor metals and commodities here as an inflation hedge, or does the wave of exuberance in stocks still have a ways to go? Any final comments or anything else that you want to leave us with today? Greg Weldon: Well, I think some of that depends on whether they can actually get some kind of job done in Washington where the Republicans finally realize their own necks are on the chopping block here, so let’s finally ban together and get a tax reform package done. We’ll see whether that happens. I think that might be one of those last gas type of moves for the stock market. It could be a “buy the rumor sell the fact,” but I think lot has been priced in and I think there’s still going to be disappointment down the road for that. I’m watching the consumer specifically. The retail sales numbers have been really poor all year. It’s minuscule gains in discretionary items since January. And the debt numbers are interesting. You’re starting to see a roll over, starting to see rise in delinquency rates. The debt obligations for consumers and for the Federal government, by the way, are high despite the fact that rates are still low. Can you imagine if the Feds actually did push rates a hundred basis points higher over the next however many, 14, 15 months? I think that would have a real reverberating effect on the consumer and on the government where deficits are still increasing and they’re at high levels again. No one talks about it. You have $20 trillion dollars in sovereign debt and you’re about to push the five-year note above 2%, which is your trigger to increase cost on funding the debt. Man, the land mines are out there. I’m watching all of it. That’s what we do for our clients every single day because never before, have you had to be more plugged in. Look at the way things happen so much more quickly now. You asked about what’s the difference from 30 years. So much more availability of news, quickly.

I seem to enter and exit endless doors and hallways, but none that seem to lead in any direction or final destination. In stutter steps I traverse slowly and carefully along a darkened path littered with broken fragments of cobblestone. my chest cavity feels cavernous as an empty canyon on a blistering summer’s heat. my heart beats as rapid as an old railroad clock. My head feels as heavy as an anvil and throbs with pain. my tongue as dry and as sandy as a cactus. a maddening howling wind at my back pushes me forward in an aimless direction without purpose or direction as if a tumble weed. I feel as if I’m cascading into a turbulent sea of insanity, drenched in perfuse sweat. I suddenly bolt upright from my pillow realizing I have awoke from this purgatorial nightmare. such an illusion, devilish delusion, a state of total confusion. so now I begin another day of drudgery, another day’s journey into life’s great unknown. copyright by: Joseph P.

It was just said to be civilizational and economic and it was said that that would bring Ukraine into European civilization and of course away from Russia. Now Ukraine and Russia had been bound at the hip. People don’t mention this often but there are tens of millions of intermarriages. It’s hard not to go to Moscow and spend some time and not find someone who’s got a Ukrainian and Russian parent or grandparent. But this happened and it also needs to be removed reminded that Yanukovych did not refuse to sign that agreement. He simply asked for more time. But that set off protests driven by all sorts of people. Some benign democratic seeking Liberals, fine people in Ukraine, but also by people who were by any definition ultra-nationalists and even quasi-fascist neo-nazis. And that led of course to the confrontation where Yanukovych was driven illegally off. A new, illegal government was formed backed by the United States and Europe. Russia for various reasons that I think were legitimate feared that the unrest would spread to the historical Russian peninsula of Crimea which for most of its history for centuries had been part of Russia. But because of a kind of fluke, was now territorially part of Ukraine. The Russians therefore welcomed and encouraged a referendum in Crimea. By all standards including Gallup polls that were taken later, more than 80 percent voted to join Russia. And so Russia legally annexed in 2014…they don’t call it annex, they call it reunited with Crimea. Meanwhile, the mostly Russian provinces of Donbass, part of Crimea objected to the coup in Kiev that had overthrown the president. They had voted for Yanukovych. His electorate was not only in southeastern Ukraine but it was primarily there. So they believed that their president had been overthrown and a rebellion began backed by Russia of course. And the war has gone on now nearly four years. The official number of dead is 10,000 but it’s surely many more and perhaps 2 million people who lived in southeastern Ukraine have been displaced most of them gone to Russia. Incidentally, Russia gets no credit for the very humanitarian way they have handled all these people, refugees who fled to Russia. Now of course it was easier because they were Russian speakers. But a great many of them have rebuilt their lives. Vocationally and in terms of their family in Russia. And whether they’ll ever go back to Ukraine is not clear. So that’s where the situation was kind of frozen. There was this agreement as you know called the Minsk 2 agreement that all the European powers agreed to there. The president of Ukraine, Poroshenko, agreed to it and that Putin agreed too for resolution of the crisis. And it called for two things…a cessation along a designated line of the fighting and Kiev’s agreement that Donbass would be given home rule. To remain within what would essentially be a federated Ukrainian state. No one has ever suggested a better or alternative solution to that. During the years since Minsk was formalized in 2015, by all evidence it seems both sides have violated the agreement. But Kiev has refused to grant any home rule to the rebel provinces and that we know from history whether it’s from the Irish civil war or other diverse countries is the only way to save a", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

I have never seen it!”. According to Finance Minister of Germany Wolfgang Sch√§uble, Germans need to learn humanistic values of Islam, and Islam is “a constituent part of Germany”. This aim is realized in three stages. Stage one - corruption of society, imposition of barbarous archaic customs, destruction of the national culture, eradication of Judeo-Christian values. Stage two - support of Islamic occupation and migrant violence, legalization of the Sharia. Stage three - suppression of dissent at all levels. It is obvious that a healthy and cohesive society would resist turning it into slavery. Therefore it is necessary to undermine its foundations, to swap values: virtue should be presented as evil, barbarity - as cultural originality, abnormality - as the norm. Courts are the main leverage in this game. Below are some of the examples of this phenomenon. In May 2013, a British court decided to grant political asylum to 27-year-old Kenyan John Thuo. Thuo, the leader of the murderous Mungiki sect, personally butchered 400 of his compatriots with a machete and took part in a disgusting female genital mutilation ritual. In 2006, a party called “Charity, Freedom and Diversity,” which advocates legalization of pedophilia, all kinds of drugs, bestiality and child pornography, was registered in Netherlands. Continued below... In August 2013, the Swedish Court set free Sture Bergwall - the sadist and cannibal who confessed that he had raped, tortured, and eaten his victims. In February 2007, a German court released the former member of The Red Army Faction (RAF) Brigitte Mohnhaupt, who had murdered 9 people in the 1970s. She didn’t express any regret about her crimes. In July 2017, The National Health Service (NHS) reported 5,391 cases of female genital mutilations. Although this disgusting procedure was banned in the UK in 1985, not a single person was convicted. This is only a marginal part of thousands of similar verdicts, which under the guise of humanism and human rights impose chaos and all kinds of perversions. On the other hand, Christian values are also being consistently destroyed. The French court ordered the removal of the cross from the statue of Pope Saint John Paul II in Plo√´rmel, because it violated the law imposing a strict separation of Church and State. In August 2017, Dutch prosecutors found nothing illegal in filming a porn movie in a Church confessional. In January 2018, the British High Court decided, that the right of homosexuals to equality “should take precedence” over the right of Christians to manifest their beliefs and moral values. (The Telegraph). When the foundation of the society is undermined, the second stage of destruction begins. In the Rule of Law, laws should be applied to all citizens - otherwise the very idea of democracy and justice loses its meaning. Today, parallel Sharia law legally operates in Western Europe. The so called Laws of the Jungle reign in “black holes” of “no-go-zones”, and courts condone lawlessness and savagery.

These iconic troops that have been nameless and faceless to Star Wars fans now have a backstory. Finn was taken from his family by the First Order and programmed to fight. (His programming seems to not have taken at all!) After his first battle, Finn decides to escape but needs a pilot to help him. Luckily for him, Poe is being held prisoner and is the best pilot in the resistance. Together, they escape, heading toward Jakku, to find BB-8 and take the secret information back to the resistance. After their ship is disabled, Finn wakes up on Jakku, where he meets up with Rey, who has befriended BB-8. After stormtroopers come calling, the three take off in the Millennium Falcon (!!) to get the information to the resistance. Guess what the information is? A map to where Luke Skywalker has been living in self-imposed exile!! So, the story is set and the parallels to the original lead one to predict where the plot is going to go. Characters are related to one another, someone dies in a way that inspires the newest Jedi, etc. Along the way we meet back up with Han and Chewbacca, and even General (nee Princess) Leia. There are many, many moments of homage to the original, and I ate them up with the rest of the audience. There are lots of things to criticize, of course. The galaxy, which has as many non-humanoid beings as humanoid beings, seems to be about 2% female and .00002% nonwhite. Droids may be more slave than robot. (We rewatched the original three, and even in those movies, droids inconsistently feel pain, fear torture or destruction, and have feelings.) As many people have pointed out, the best parts of the movie are unoriginal. But I will watch it again and again. Rey is a much more interesting female character than Princess Leia, and a less whiny Jedi than Luke. (Don’t get me started about Hayden Christensen’s Anakin. Anakin is such a bad Jedi, he makes Finn look like a great stormtrooper.) Finn seems also more three-dimensional than Han. I’m very interested to see where the plot is going. Where is the plot going? One of the Star Wars trailers has a voice-over by Luke (Mark Hamill), saying “The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. And you have it.” This is a riff on the same speech Luke gives Leia in Episode VI, but with the last sentence added. This speech is never given in Episode VII (in fact Luke doesn’t speak in this episode). So, we assume that he will eventually give the speech to Rey, but how does Rey have the Force? Is she related to Luke? Will the movies ever mention midichlorians again (no!). To be continued. . . .", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Add your two cents. Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Now and then, I republish an explosive interview with two Rockefeller Trilateral Commission members, highlighting how much political power can be controlled in a few hands. People often misunderstand how the game works. In the area of US foreign policy, for example, they focus on the long-standing rats’ nest called the State Department. Well, they should. But that bureaucracy implements policy. It doesn’t really formulate the basics. The basics come from higher on the food chain. The Globalist movement—within which the Trilateral Commission is a leading force—dictates a “one-world” theme. Separate nations and their power should be melted down and folded into one planet-wide management system. This system would ultimately determine worldwide production quotas for goods and services, and their distribution. Energy, in particular, is a prime target. How much will be created? Who will benefit? Who will suffer? The US federal government and other governments around the world are currently trying to bring us closer to that “utopian day.” Who sits in the shadows pulling their strings? Here is another question that has the same answer: who is in charge of undermining free markets and thus taking down economies? One group has been virtually forgotten. Its influence is enormous. It has existed since 1973. It’s called the Trilateral Commission (TC). Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create “a new international economic order.” In 1969, four years before birthing the TC with David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote: “[The] nation state as a fundamental unit of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force. International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation state.” Goodbye, separate nations. Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, in his Memoirs (2003): “Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” Patrick Wood, author of Trilaterals Over Washington, points out there are only 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America.

As I talked about in the messages that are recorded in the book Mary Magdalene Beckons, there are three primary arenas where the Feminine needs to be strong. It is within these three arenas that many people need to examine themselves and see what work they may have to do to complete the strengthening of the Feminine within. This is so important for people to do at this time. First and foremost, this is work for you to do with yourself, for your own strengthening and balancing. Secondly, this work needs to be done for your sacred relationships you will be engaging in your life, that these can come into balance. The third very important reason is that you are not only doing this work for yourself. You do this as service to humanity, for your whole world. As you transform, as you strengthen and develop and grow yourself, you are affecting what is accessible for people, what is available to people, and what is becoming strong for your whole world. Any time you do growth and transformation work for yourself, it affects everyone. That is very, very important at this time. You are all at a very critical juncture, where there is great opportunity opening up for your world, and for human beings, in particular, to transition into a higher level of consciousness. This will be reflected in a higher dimension of reality coming in and being the realm that you all inhabit, that you know, that you live in and are manifesting in. This is the great opportunity you have at this time. Those of you who are on your spiritual path, who are light-workers, very likely those of you who are listening to me at this time, many of you are quite aware of this. I, and so many beings of the higher realms, thank you for all that you are doing to support this amazing transformation that is underway in your world. This is not only affecting the Earth. This transformation is so vast and involves so many places in your universe, all of which you are affecting through the spiritual work you are doing. It is most important. We thank all of you for this. I am aware that I have wandered away a bit from where I started, which was explaining about the Divine Feminine and the arenas through which this manifests within each of you. Now I wish to return to that. What I want to explain is that there are these three arenas that are the foundation of the Divine Feminine within each one of you: the relationship with your physical body, the relationship with your sexuality, and the relationship with your emotions. For each of you, these are the places that I strongly urge you to examine and see what may need strengthening within yourself. This is what I talked about in great depth in the messages I gave in the book Mary Magdalene Beckons, along with my guidance and instruction as to what each of you can do to strengthen these areas. As I said at that time, of these three, the area that is most critical for the most people is the way that you respond to pain. The area of emotions, for many people, is quite confusing. Your emotions are truly a gift from the divine that is rather unique to human beings in your realm. Yet many of you do not yet fully understand how to receive this gift that has been given to you in the emotional realm and how to work with emotions, particularly your painful emotions. This is the part that is most challenging for many of you. You did not receive", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Now, I guess it really does not matter if the water they were grown in contain human feces.

Over 100 cases occurred mid-November in participants at a Tofino oyster festival. Six cases occurred in persons attending a December oyster barbecue in Victoria. By March over 300 additional cases of norovirus linked to cultivated BC oysters harvested from multiple sites on both the east and west coasts of Vancouver Island were identified in BC, Alberta, and Ontario consumers. Norovirus is a highly infectious cause of gastroenteritis typically spread from person to person and is associated with regular community outbreaks in schools, hospitals, day cares, and care facilities. Foodborne outbreaks of norovirus are often linked to ill food handlers. In this recent outbreak, oysters were contaminated in the marine environment where they were farmed. The trace-back of oysters consumed by infected individuals led to the closure of 13 geographically dispersed marine farms in BC (see map) and to extensive public outreach. Genotypic analysis of norovirus isolated from the cases included several variants of genogroup I (GI) early in the outbreak and both genogroups GI and GII later in the outbreak. Both GI and GII norovirus were detected in oysters from shellfish farms. This suggests that oysters bind and act as a reservoir for community outbreak strains and disseminate those strains to consumers.[1] Although sewage is often the cause of oyster contamination it remains unclear whether one or many sewage sources contributed to the contamination of shellfish farms. The 2016–17 outbreak was preceded by a wet fall and accompanied an unseasonably cold winter. Wet, cold, and dark winters enhance norovirus survival, allowing for longer retention in ocean sediments and in oysters.[2,3] The infective dose of norovirus is estimated as few as 18 particles.[2] Given the low infective dose and the viability of norovirus in cold water, we postulate that sewage spread by ocean currents may have contaminated geographically dispersed farms.

Add your two cents. Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! This week, the House Intelligence Committee agreed to release the transcripts from the November 14, 2017 testimony of Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS. Fusion GPS, as we all know, is the research firm employed to gather research on Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle – first by conservative news site, The Washington Free Beacon, and then picked up by the Clinton campaign. There’s been a lot of controversy surrounding the dossier produced through those efforts. Some details have been proven, some disproved, and others remain unsubstantiated. Whatever the case, Republican lawmakers insist an unsubstantiated dossier was the sole impetus for the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as possible collusion by Trump’s team, and they want the investigation shut down. Democrats, predictably, want to push further, desperate to prove that they didn’t make a bad decision by installing Hillary Clinton as their hand-picked candidate for the presidency. Then there are those who are standing in between, with suspicions, and maybe some doubts, but who ultimately want to hear everything and get to the truth. That would be where I’m at, actually. And speaking of everything, what do the released transcripts of Simpson’s testimony reveal? Keeping in mind that this was Simpson speaking about what his firm suspected, the transcripts show that there was suspicions of something beyond just an election. “Those transcripts reveal serious allegations that the Trump Organization may have engaged in money laundering with Russian nationals,” Representative Adam Schiff said. May have. And honestly, the rumors of Trump and his organization being neck-deep in dealings with the Russian mob have been around for years. These aren’t campaign-generated accusations. Talk to longtime residents of New York and New Jersey and you get the impression that it’s a badly kept secret. So what brought Simpson and his company to suspect such nefarious activities? In his testimony, Simpson said that his firm closely examined sales of condominiums in Trump properties in New York, Miami, Panama City and Toronto. “There were a lot of real estate deals where you couldn’t really tell who was buying the property,” Simpson said. “And sometimes properties would be bought and sold, and they would be bought for one price and sold for a loss shortly thereafter, and it really didn’t make sense to us.” “We saw patterns of buying and selling that we thought were suggestive of money-laundering,” he continued. The Trump Organization’s chief counsel, Alan Garten, claims that the properties referenced by Simpson were simply properties Trump had licensed his name to, rather than having any substantial interest in. “These accusations are completely reckless and unsubstantiated for a multitude of reasons,” Garten said. “These issues have nothing to do with the scope of the investigation” by the House intelligence committee, Garten said in a phone interview. “But it’s not surprising the minority (Democrats) would focus on this given they’ve found absolutely no evidence of collusion.” He’s not wrong. I don’t think the ongoing Russia probe was meant to target potential criminal activity, such as money laundering. I do believe, however, that if money laundering or any other criminal activity is swept up in the ongoing investigation, it could certainly go to motive.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! This article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge. Editor’s Comment: The EU is now asserting its authority as an instrument of stability, and telling member states to fall in line, lest more severe consequences should arise – namely war. Does this amount to a threat, or do EU bureaucrats merely mean to indicate that only through a centralized authority with diminished states rights can they avoid war? Europe may face disintegration anyway; its currency crises and migration woes are causing instability, and its caught-in-the-middle position complicates its relationships with the East and West. Nevertheless, the drums of war are beating all across the globe, and influence over Europe and the Middle East have become region blocs for conquest. The original formations of the EU were built through an Atlantic network, including the secretive Bilderberg group, as an extension of the post-war Pax Americana. EU Commissioner’s Dire Warning: “The Only Alternative To Europe Is War” by Tyler Durden While the saying goes “good fences make good neighbors,” it appears the leadership of The EU is starting to get frustrated with the lack of acquiescence among some of the ‘union’s’ newer or more marginal members. In a somewhat stunning statement, following ongoing and contentious meetings to discuss solutions to the migrant ‘problem’, EU Commissioner Timmermanns appeared to warn disagreeable member states, “There is an alternative to everything. I believe in EU cooperation because of all other forms in history have been tried to help Europeans get on better, and with the exception of this one, all other forms have led to war – so let’s stick to this one.” As Elsevier reports (via Google Translate), European leaders read the last few days the alarm about the survival of the European Union (EU). Prague said Commissioner Frans Timmermans (PvdA) Friday that the EU is only one alternative: war. “The only alternative to the EU is war,” said Timmermans Friday gave a speech at a conference in Prague, said a reporter for The Times of London who attended the speech. Timmermans is the way Europe responds to the migration crisis’ the biggest threat to the EU ever. The Commissioner underlined that countries should cooperate better when it comes to border controls. “Migration is part of life, but we must lead these movements together in the right direction,” said Timmermans. Matching words Timmermans in the alarmist tone that European leaders were heard in recent days about the survival of the EU. Earlier this week, Timmermans at the House of Europe Lecture in Amsterdam that he fears for the survival of the EU. “I do not optimistic about doing that, because I’m just not. This is the first time in my conscious experience of European cooperation that I think: it could ever really be able beaches. Luxembourg Foreign Minister, who will chair the Council of the European Union on behalf of his country, spoke in an interview about identical words. The current migration crisis is the European ideal of free movement shaking on its foundations. EU President Donald Tusk said that the EU is engaged in “a race against the clock.” “But we are determined to win this race,” said Tusk. “As I warned earlier, the only way not to dismantle the Schengen ensure proper management of the external borders of", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

It’s not hard to find examples of these phenomena in the current political atmosphere. Congressmen like Justin Amash or Senators like Bernie Sanders are often touted as “rabble-rousers” who don’t tow the party line. The idea is often expressed that principles should take a backseat to party unity and party accomplishment, which so often takes the form of voting the “right way.” There are also tests for party “purity,” such as the Democrats’ recent “pro-choice” test, the idea that a “real” Democrat cannot be pro-life. Structural Faults When Congressmen like Rand Paul have filibustered in opposition to their party’s agenda, leaders like John McCain attack them, implying they need to fall in line. The second risk for groupthink is structural faults, specifically insulation and closed leadership. By being insulated from outside voices or dissenting opinions, all while being subjected to leadership which discourages dissent and dictates “how it is,” a group is likely to doom itself to making a poor decision. Congress seems to be inherently insulated when it comes to its decision-making. In theory, Congresspeople represent their constituency’s interests at the federal level. However, most Congress-people are not particularly in touch with their constituency. Such insulation is not Congress’s fault, but rather a fault in design; Washington is geographically isolated from most of the United States. Getting in touch with one’s Congressperson can be nigh on impossible, especially if one is far from Washington. The best-case scenario tends to be leaving messages with congressional aides, but chances for actual direct contact are low. The only exception seems to be on the campaign trail, the goal of which is not governance, but re-election. For Senators, such insulation can be doubly strong. With the passage of the 17th Amendment, Senators became essentially unaccountable to any form of local governance for a majority of their term of office. In theory, the direct election of Senators gives locals a chance to vote them out, but it can be hard to remember Senators’ specific legislative actions when election season rolls around afterward, which can take several years. The second structural fault which increases the risk of groupthink is that of closed leadership: leaders who say “this is how it is.” Such leaders often play the role of mindguards: quashing dissent and trying to ensure that Congresspeople behave according to the party line rather than their own beliefs. Again, it’s not hard to find instances of this in recent politics. When Congressmen like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul have filibustered in opposition to their own party’s agenda, Republican leaders like John McCain came out to attack them as, essentially, traitors, the implication being that they need to fall in line, their own principles be damned. The Power of the Situation Time pressures pose a similar risk for groupthink. The third and final risk for groupthink is the power of the situation. Very often, our behavior is as much a function of our circumstances as our own individuality. Two situational features increase the likelihood of groupthink: perceived threats and time pressure. The idea of responding strongly and quickly to a threat is powerful, even evolutionarily advantageous. However, quick and strong responses are not often, if ever, the best decisions. Both parties often frame their agendas in opposition to an enemy", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

March 26th, 2017 By Paul Levy Guest writer for Wake Up World In these uncertain, crazy, and polarizing and scary times we live in, one thing I think everyone can agree on is this: if viewed as a single macro-organism, humanity has fallen ill. With the ascension of Donald Trump onto the highest throne of political power on planet earth, some of us might feel that the sickness is finally going to be called out, illumined and healed, while others feel that Trump and his administration are themselves the current purveyors, lineage holders and embodiments of the sickness. Either way, the fact that humanity is not well — afflicted with some sort of disorder — is something that I think we can all agree upon; this might be a good starting point for our inquiry. The obvious question: What is the nature of this deeper sickness that is pulsing through the veins of humanity? In contemplating this very question, philosopher John McMurtry, author of the brilliant book The Cancer Stage of Capitalism, refers to the “Great Sickness” that pervades our modern day capitalist system as having all of the hallmark qualities of cancer. Using a whole systems approach, he points out that the diagnosis of cancer precisely maps onto a macro-analysis of our current body politic, which is to say that what is happening collectively in our world can be recognized to be a form of cancer.

Instead, HUD, DOT and the Department of Education are moving ahead with regional Equity Assistance Centers as part of President Obama’s Stronger Together program, (see page 22) to teach local educators how to attain income diversity in classrooms as a means to improve educational outcomes. Twisted logic Economic mobility is the reasoning behind one of the administration’s most aggressive programs to relocate low-income families into better areas. It sounds reasonable, but ignores the real causes of economic immobility and deprives the next generation of the mental tools necessary to compete and succeed. Economic mobility is the ability of individuals to move up and down the earnings ladder. Greater mobility is associated with job opportunities, wealth accumulation and personal freedom. At one time, Americans easily migrated from the poor to the middle class, but since the 1980’s this has slowed until today, the U.S. is one of the least economically mobile of all first world nations.The main causes for our immobility are technological advances that reduced the need for many middle income positions; and more importantly, a recession recovery that added high paying jobs for the upper class, and service oriented work for low-income brackets, but little for the middle class. With fewer middle class opportunities, the poor are stuck with nowhere to advance.The administration is right to conclude that economic mobility is a factor of success. But that success requires organic mobility, not federally mandated mobility. Desiring, striving and overcoming whatever disadvantages there may be is all part of the success model.To help poor families improve, HUD-USED-DOT wants to relocate schoolchildren in the elementary and secondary grades to gain economic diversity in each classroom. In an accompanying program, Small Area Fair Market Rents, HUD families will find their section 8 vouchers reduced in lower income zip codes and raised in wealthier neighborhoods, forcing them to move to more affluent areas, regardless of their wishes.The President touts this misguided program as “fundamental” to children’s success. The rationale is akin to the absurd conclusion that, “well-to-do families drive BMW’s, therefore, if we buy Beamers for low-income families, they too will share the success of the higher earners.” Under this logic, you could even provide a study proving that the owners of their new subsidized BMW’s are more psychologically content, arrive at work faster, and return home early enough to spend more quality time with the family and help the kids with their schoolwork. You can fool some of the people, all of the time Government agencies frequently mislead local public officials and the public by including wording in their documents that implies the opposite of what the regulation actually accomplishes. A case in point is the administration’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule that utilizes the Fair Housing Act to eliminate segregation and discrimination. While this seems like a good cause, in practice, the program does little to eliminate discrimination. It does impose aggressive oversight over community planning. During the regulatory comment period for AFFH, astute responders questioned HUD’s “intrusion into local affairs and responsibilities,” particularly zoning.

That means there’s still ample opportunity for more skid-related fender benders before spring springs and the grass starts rizzing. And to that end, Mitsubishi Canada has been on the road as well, bringing some professional drivers and some of their Outlander SUV/Crossovers to Alberta to not only showcase the “crummy weather capabilities” of their vehicles but to give some handy tips to attendees who find themselves oot and aboot when the white stuff sticks. I love these events; they’re not only fun but they can help you “navigate the neige” with more confidence and skill. I did a similar type of thing a couple of years back when Ford came through and will always show up for such events because you can never have too much practice - and it’s a real hoot sliding around a snowy open area in someone else’s vehicle (and they treat you really nicely, too). So it was that Mitsubishi and their folk, armed with a squadron of Outlanders, came through Calgary last Saturday on the last leg of their three stop tour to Wild Rose Country. They were accompanied as well by representatives from Morrisport Advanced Driving, a group of personable driving experts with whom I’ve worked before as well. The event kicked off with a short presentation by Morrisport’s Lawrence Howlett, who outlined what we could expect from the two hour session and then gave us some insight into such issues as proper seating position, the physics of vehicle control and the benefits of such technologies as traction control and ABS, as well as Mitsubishi’s systems of All Wheel Control There are actually two such systems - well, one’s an enhancement of the other - available on the Outlander and given Mitsubishi’s legendary record when it comes to rallying, the company appears to have gotten the technology down pat. The basic AWC sends torque, when the vehicle’s electronic brain deems it necessary, from the front to the rear axle to help ensure good traction when the front wheels (the base model is a front driver - like many, many others in the SUV/Crossover market these days) start losing traction. The “Super All Wheel Control” that’s available on the GT trim level ups that ante by adding torque vectoring between the front left and right wheels as well, for even better control when push comes to shove. Both systems work well, as we noticed during the driving part of the event, but the bottom line as always is the proverbial nut behind the wheel, which meant the driving part of the experience was even more important because it gave us a chance to actually put the words into practice. And so we did! The event, held at Calgary’s WinSport complex (aka Canada Olympic Park), had us navigate a slalom course initially, starting slowly and building up speed as we got comfortable. Thanks to fresh snow it was plenty slippery, which of course worked to the benefit of the exercise, but the combination of Mitsubishi’s AWC systems and the expert guidance meant that very few cones were clobbered", "_diversity_score": 9.461294703485741}

Such encounters are the path we must walk if our wish is to fulfill whatever may be our Divinely dispensed possibilities. However, the more awake we can be, the more mindful of the whole of ourselves we are before we start moving toward any aim in life, the less likely we are to find ourselves feeling stressed, angry, or fearful over where we end up.

If I were mindful, I couldn’t be tempted into making the same mistake repeatedly, let alone believe in the sense of regret that always follows. 4. If I were mindful, I wouldn’t have to talk to myself for any reason, let alone explain or justify myself for whatever may have just happened. 5. If I were mindful, I could never say something cruel to anyone, anywhere, for any reason. 6. If I were mindful, I would never judge those around me, let alone myself. 7. If I were mindful, I would be consciously aware of anything I take into myself… whether some kind of food, my own thoughts and feelings, or the emanations of others. 8. If I were mindful, I would lose all fascination with talking about myself. 9. If I were mindful, I would know – without having to think about it – the general, if not the specific inner state of anyone around me. 10. If I were mindful, I could never be made to act impulsively. 11. If I were mindful, I would have no need, whatsoever, to put on any kind of pretense. 12. If I were mindful, I would be able to use the negative manifestation of others for a highly positive purpose. 13. If I were mindful, I would know the difference between wants and needs. 14.

You have to stop looking at porn and thinking sex is all there is to a relationship. That’s immediate doom if you want a long lasting and happy relationship. You have to start looking in the right places, not night clubs, dating sites, or slutty MILFS and cougars. You need a good woman with a Christian faith, yes that’s right I said Christian. Believe me, if a woman follows Bible principles she’ll respect and love you, so long as she’s true to her faith and loves God. God created us all and knows what’s best so if she loves Him and is qualities, she’ll love you, so long as you imitate the qualities of God. Now you’re likely thinking, you need God to get a woman? Well no, but trust me, my wife is the only woman I have ever known who loved God. Compared to previous partners who said that was stupid and evolution is the answer for life on earth, she’s by far way ahead of them. A Christian woman is humble, loving towards all, especially her man and children, does not care for the things in the world, does not want multiple partners. She does want a long lasting relationship.

And protecting data is even more important for military personnel, whose lives could be in danger if some types of information were to get into the wrong hands. Now, one group reports in ACS Nano a new way to protect data, especially when it is subjected to extreme environmental conditions. According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the financial loss from cybercrime in the U.S. was over $1.3 billion in 2016. As this number is only expected to rise in the upcoming years, the military, businesses and individuals are seeking new ways to guard their information. Traditional methods involve installing software, but that can require frequent updates and large amounts of power. As a result, experts have proposed alternative security methods based on hardware. Physical unclonable function (PUF) devices hold promise. Random physical variations occur as this type of hardware is fabricated, which creates a unique structure that is impossible to copy or clone. But current PUFs are sensitive to harsh environments, making them a bad choice for military or outside use. So Yang-Kyu Choi and colleagues wanted to make new PUF hardware that would overcome this challenge. The researchers designed a PUF based on nano-electro mechanical switches (NEMs), which are often used in circuits and are known for their low power consumption. A nanowire in the contraption floats between two gates. As the liquid used in the fabrication process naturally evaporates, the wire bends and adheres to one of the gates. Depending on which gate the nanowire is touching, a 0 or a 1 is generated. An array of several gates and nanowires can create an unpredictable, unique code. The NEM-PUF withstood exposure to high temperatures, microwaves and high-dose radiation. In the case of a data breach, it can self-destruct, providing an additional layer of security. “Nano-electromechanical Switch Based on a Physical Unclonable Function for Highly Robust and Stable Performance in Harsh Environments” American Chemical Society, ACS is a congressionally chartered independent membership organization which represents professionals at all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry and sciences that involve chemistry.

Two neo-Marxist professors at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada were recorded berating a young female teaching assistant for showing her first-year communications students a debate where professor Jordan Peterson argued against the use of non-gendered pronouns. Teaching assistant Lindsay Shepherd can be heard breaking down into tears as her supervising professor Nathan Rambukkan and another professor, Herbert Pimlott, accuse her of creating a “toxic” and “problematic” environment which constitutes violence against transgendered students. Here’s the audio from the National Post: Full tape: Here’s some highlights: 00:03:10 “These arguments are counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code” Rambukkana: …[Peterson] lectures about critiquing feminism, critiquing trans rights — Shepherd: I’m familiar. I follow him. But can you shield people from those ideas? Am I supposed to comfort them and make sure that they are insulated away from this? Like, is that what the point of this is? Because to me, that is so against what a university is about. So against it. I was not taking sides. I was presenting both arguments. Rambukkana: So the thing about this is, if you’re presenting something like this, you have to think about the kind of teaching climate that you’re creating. And this is actually, these arguments are counter to the Canadian Human Rights Code. Even since … C-16, ever since this passed, it is discriminatory to be targeting someone due to their gender identity or gender expression. By C-16, Rambukkana is referring to a recently passed federal bill that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity or expression. His read of it is dead wrong; it’s obviously not a violation of C-16 to screen a TVOntario program at a university. For one thing, the bill only applies to federally-regulated industries, which does not include universities. Even if it did, legal experts contacted by the National Post were extremely dubious that Shepherd’s actions constituted anything remotely resembling discrimination. 00:04:22 “It has created a toxic climate for some of the students” Shepherd:Like I said, it was in the spirit of debate.

This finding is highly significant, and not just because it was the first time that astronomers have observed a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster. In addition, it confirms what scientists have been suspecting for a few years now, thanks to recent radio and x-ray studies of globular clusters and the detection of gravity wave signals. Basically, it indicates that black holes are more common in globular clusters than previously thought. “Until recently, it was assumed that almost all black holes would disappear from globular clusters after a short time and that systems like this should not even exist!” said Giesers. “But clearly this is not the case – our discovery is the first direct detection of the gravitational effects of a stellar-mass black hole in a globular cluster. This finding helps in understanding the formation of globular clusters and the evolution of black holes and binary systems – vital in the context of understanding gravitational wave sources.” This find was also significant given that the relationship between black holes and globular clusters remains a mysterious, but highly important one. Due to their high masses, compact volumes, and great ages, astronomers believe that clusters have produced a large number of stellar-mass black holes over the course of the Universe’s history. This discovery could therefore tell us much about the formation of globular clusters, black holes, and the origins of gravitational wave events.

Full legalization proposals. We will have full legalization measures on the ballot in five states this fall: Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Arizona, and California. A sixth, Michigan, would have qualified but for last-minute legislation. In several of the states with pending initiatives, establishment prohibitionists have gone to court in a desperate effort to get the courts to intervene to keep the measures off the ballot. In Maine, Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap attempted to invalidate a significant number of the signatures gathered by the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol in Maine, arguing that the signature of a single notary did not match the one on file with the state. Fortunately, Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy overruled Dunlap’s decision. When the signatures were recounted, the measure, Question 1, qualified for the ballot. In Massachusetts, once the Secretary of State had qualified the legalization initiative for the ballot, a group of prohibitionists calling themselves the Safe and Healthy Massachusetts Campaign sued to have the measure removed from the ballot, claiming it violated the constitutional limitation prohibiting an initiative from dealing with two unrelated topics. This challenge was subsequently dismissed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and the measure, Question 4, will now appear on the November ballot. In Arizona, a group calling itself Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy — including two prominent country prosecutors and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce — filed suit to try to keep the legalization initiative off the ballot, after it had been qualified by the Secretary of State. The group claimed that the 100-word summary (a limit set by statute) did not accurately reflect everything contained in the 30-page proposal. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Jo Lynn Gentry rejected the argument and approved the measure, Proposition 205, for the ballot. In California — the big enchilada for the 2016 elections and a state in which opponents to an initiative are permitted to include on the ballot their reasons for opposing the proposal — it was the proponents who went to court. The Yes on 64 advocates successfully challenged all six arguments that opponents had wanted to appear on the ballot, and Superior Court Judge Shelleyanne W.L. Chang found all six “false and misleading.” She ordered the opponents to modify their arguments, most of which falsely claimed the initiative would permit pro-marijuana ads to appear on radio and television and would appeal to children. And in Michigan, where proponents, MI Legalize, had turned in a sufficient number of signatures (more than 350,000) to qualify a legalization measure for the ballot, the state legislature quickly rammed through a new law in June declaring signatures older than 180 days to be invalid, leaving proponents shy of the required number of signatures. Proponents have filed suit against the state, challenging the new limitations on constitutional grounds, but it appears the appeal will not be decided in time for the initiative to appear on the 2016 ballot, even if the appeal succeeds.", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303, "_bm25_score": 5.169622056200213, "_rank": 6, "_combined_score": 2.412000881629057, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.5344735435595938}

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! A Visalia, California, girl has died after doctors misdiagnosed her bacterial infection as the flu. Alyssa Alcaraz was showing some symptoms of having the flu and with so many others in California coming down with the virus, doctors they were certain that is what she had – but they were wrong, and now Alyssa has died. The bacterial infection moved quickly through Alyssa’s body and wasn’t discovered until after her death. Mariah Alcaraz recalls the day her sister got sick. “I remember she came home from school and she was throwing up and I thought oh she’s probably got food poisoning she’s going to be ok.” But the infection was not food poisoning. Alyssa’s mom says the doctors told the family that her daughter had the flu. After a few days of staying home from school and not getting better, they took Alyssa back to urgent care. That is when a physician realized the young girl’s oxygen levels were low and she was immediately rushed to Kaweah Delta Medical Center by ambulance. According to ACB30, within hours, Alyssa’s organs started shutting down and her family says she “coded” (slang referring to a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest) six times. By 2:50 PM Sunday afternoon the young vibrant girl with a passion for music and singing had died. Her death certificate says she went into cardiac arrest and septic shock from a strep blood infection – an infection no one in her family knew she had since doctors said she had the flu. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with expenses that come with a death. If you would like to donate to Alyssa’s fund, please click here.

Racers such as the Morrisport guys know and practice this and they helped attendees understand the concept before unleashing us to wreak our own special havoc on the snowy lot. The bottom line of the event is that it gave those of us who were there a chance to learn about and practice - in a limited manner under controlled conditions - optimal steering wheel control, vision and anticipation, as well as some obstacle avoidance and emergency braking tactics in both a straight line and on curves. You can do this on your own on any reasonably large, snow-covered parking lot. Sure, you may not have the expert guidance we had during Mitsubishi’s event, or a bunch of cones to lay out, but any practice is good practice and if you can learn to control your vehicle better by doing a few donuts after the mall has closed for the day, you’ll be more confident and more skilled when push really does come to slide in the real world.

Hemp Improves Farming Aquaponics Hemp plants don’t need pesticides or synthetic fertilizers, which rely mostly on the phosphate industry. A phosphate industry byproduct is the sodium fluoride that is sold to municipality water works for our poisoned tap water. The runoff from fields of phosphate fertilizers into waterways that merge with seawater is causing all sorts of nitrogen and phosphorous excesses and imbalances, leading to algae that stifles the water’s ecological support systems. Hemp’s thick roots ward off weeds, and growing hemp improves the soil’s nitrogen, making that soil better for other crops. They would be useful and lucrative rotation crops for organic farmers. Hemp plants have a growth cycle of only four months. In mild climates, harvesting hemp two times in one year would create an annual cash cow for farmers. The marijuana taboo is eliminated by allowing the male plants to continually pollinate the female plants. This reduces psychotropic THC to legal levels. Eliminating Toxic Petrochemical Plastics There is a clump of plastic waste residue larger than the state of Texas floating in the middle of the Pacific. A lot of it is expected to decompose, creating a plastic soup in the ocean. The toxins from this plastic soup spread out into other oceanic regions and are hazardous to fish and bird wildlife. This soup could find its way into our kitchens as well! All kinds of plastics are produced with hemp, from clear wraps for foods to automobile parts. Hemp plastics are durable and heat resistant. And they are bio-degradable. Recently the French auto industry use hemp to manufacture some of its automobile parts. Henry Ford pioneered this in 1941 when he built his “vegetable car” with hemp and flax. It was stronger and lighter than steel cars. Ford’s hemp-mobile also used hemp bio-diesel fuel, which creates very little pollution. The petroleum industry didn’t want to see or hear that. Hemp seeds were even used to make paints and lacquers in the mid-1930s. Petrochemical plastics for all purposes could be replaced with hemp plastics that are non-toxic and bio-degradable. Bye-bye BPA! Construction Materials for Housing Amazingly, housing construction materials made from hemp fibers have been discovered to be superior to most cheap materials used in housing construction these days. Ever see a house under construction after its initial framing? What you’ll usually see before whatever exterior coating is used are sheets of wood substitutes, either pasteboard or particle board or pressboards, some of which are processed and bound with toxic chemicals that can off-gas into interior quarters. It’s cheaper than other materials and used abundantly. Inexpensive Aquaponics Hemp can be made into various different building materials, hempcrete, fiberboard, carpet, stucco, cement blocks, insulation, and plastic. Those materials are stronger and much longer lasting than what’s being used currently. They are also mold and rot free and more fire resistant. And they are environmentally and ecologically friendly and non-toxic. More Trees for Tree Huggers Pulp from trees is used to make paper. But anything wood pulp can do, hemp fibers can do better. It’s said that the original Constitution and Bill of Rights were on hemp paper. Paper from trees can be recycled maybe three times. Hemp paper can be recycled eight times. Since hemp was effectively banned in the USA since 1937, 70% of the USA’s forests have been eliminated", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Please feel free to post your comments, and small cap requests in the comments below. Quindell postscript This announcement caught my eye. The audit firm which signed off Quindell’s dodgy accounts for 2010/11 has been fined £700k + £90k costs by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). This obscure body supposedly polices published accounts. However it rarely seems to take action, and when it does, is very slow. The audit partner responsible, has also been reprimanded (big deal!) and fined £56k – which is not a material sum of money to a partner in a decent-sized accountancy firm. Also, look at the timeline – it’s now 7 years from those incorrect accounts being created. Hardly a rapid response team! As longer term readers here will remember, I was consistently very bearish on Quindell, since its accounts were fairly obviously highly suspect. Excessive debtors, excessive capitalisation into intangible assets, and a flurry of acquisitions to muddy the waters, are the usual give-aways of fake profits, so these dodgy companies are really terribly easy to spot. You can spot a highly abnormal balance sheet in just a few seconds, so it really doesn’t take any particular forensic accounting skills to uncover dodgy companies with false profits. You just have to have your wits about you. The same was true with Globo. It was amazing how much venom from deluded fools in the investing community my bearish comments attracted over these 2 dodgy companies. There was even an attempt to get me sacked from this role at Stockopedia, by Quindell/Globo shareholders cancelling their Stockopedia subscriptions! Of course, Ed put editorial integrity before short term revenues, backing me to the hilt. That I was proven correct by subsequent events, was very satisfying. Anyway, the perpetrators of the Quindell and Globo frauds are still at large, with their ill-gotten gains, having relieved gullible UK investors of hundreds of millions of pounds. As I sadly commented to an investor friend at the weekend, white collar crime in the UK very much does pay. The action taken by the FRC, reported today, is too little, too late, in my view, to properly punish, or deter, the same sort of thing happening again. Kudos by the way, to Tom Winnifrith, for his tireless, obsessive exposure of multiple wrongdoings at both Quindell and Globo. People may not like his style, but he’s done outstanding work exposing many dodgy companies. Having worked in audit myself, at the start of my career in the early 1990s, I can confirm that it’s really very easy to pull the wool over the eyes of auditors. Their checks on the numbers are not very detailed, and a clever FD can cover up all sorts of problems. So the onus is very much on investors to do our own reasonableness-checking on published accounts. If the numbers don’t look right, then it’s best to steer", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Add your two cents. Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! One day you’re happily blogging away, and the next, your hosting provider suddenly shuts down your site. It’s imperative to prepare for any number of disasters such as this by proactively backing up your data. If you cherish the thousands of tweets you posted, the Facebook memories you’ve created, pictures you’ve taken, or even your tax returns from the last 6 years, don’t take any chances. Everyone thinks it can’t happen to them until it does. You don’t have to violate your service provider’s ToS to be removed from the platform. You can easily be a target for a malicious virus or ransomware where your hard drive becomes encrypted by a third party, and they threaten to delete its contents unless you pay them in bitcoins. With all of the major password leaks online, and an alarming amount of people using easily guessed passwords like “password” or “Star Wars”, your social media data is also at risk. Of course it would solve most of our problems if we obeyed websites’ ToS, avoided risky sites, created randomly generated 16 digit passwords, and followed all the other ways to protect your sensitive data (which I outlined in this nifty series). Alas, there’s only so many hours in the day and it’s impossible to predict every catastrophe that comes our way. If all else goes wrong, it’s best to at least have an emergency backup so you’re not starting from scratch. Here’s a quick guide for downloading all of your data from major social media sites and Google, and a few ways to routinely back it up. Social Media Download Keep in mind, that while these directions and links are taken directly from social media sites, they quite often like to change the exact steps and even the links.

You could be cut if you have a bit of low rally backed up to $1,300. You back below it a little bit to dollars; still looks kind of strong. It’s an interest rate differential dynamic as a more hawkish view for the Fed is priced into the Fed funds; that gets transferred into the two-year and five-year treasury notes. The two-year treasury notes at a record high-yield relative to the German two-year schatzi. So, that lifting the dollar … it’s kind of gravitational pull to the upside. And that is some of the downside risk here; that the rally we just saw is kind of you b-wave and maybe you have a c-wave down towards $1,240. That’s kind of an ultimate low. Whether or not it plays out that way, longer term we still like it. Mike Gleason: Precious metals have had a pretty respectable year all in all. Gold is up about 11% year to date. Silver is up about half as much. There isn’t exactly a lot of excitement. It seems like it’s always two steps forward, one step back. Sentiment in the physical bullion markets, where we operate, is muted. There are multiple factors to consider as to why metals markets are stuck in a bit of a rut. It seems to us that one of the big ones is the equities market stock prices just keep marching relentlessly higher. Either investors have become totally desensitized to risk or maybe there just isn’t as much risk as well think there is. In any event, barring some sort of spike in inflation expectations, which pushes metals and stocks both higher, we don’t see gold and silver breaking out unless investors start getting nervous about stock market valuations and thinking about safe havens. So what are your thoughts about equity markets and how they relate to precious metals, Greg? And where do you see stock prices headed in the near term? Greg Weldon: Yeah, I mean it’s a perfect question because the reality is, and we in our daily research we focused on this, in fact yesterday. We haven’t spoken … It sounds like we arranged this question. Focusing on the fact that gold, relative to S&P, is at a low. You really are kind of lows that we’ve seen before, but at a level where if you get much lower, you’re breaking down to multi-year lows and this whole thing gets called into question from a technical perspective. But my problem with looking at it from a technical perspective, is that I think the stock market is living in borrowed times. Basically, the Fed has done exactly what they wanted to do. They have flushed people out of safe havens and into risk assets. That’s the whole idea of QE. It worked. You reflated the stock market. That has facilitated a huge, unprecedented rise in consumer credit. Instead of the housing market being the collateral like it was in 2006 and 2007, now it’s the stock market that’s the collateral, the Googles and Amazons of the world and the Facebooks of the world. And you have this demand that is being driven or really being fed by credit. Now you see the credit numbers start to slow. They’re unsustainable. You start to see the consumer roll over a little bit. So that’s the number one risk to the stock market; it’s actually the consumer. If you look at the retail sales", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Tesla had experimented with radio frequencies in an effort to locate the specific frequencies that would transmit through the Earths atmosphere. The experiments that Tesla conducted, in high voltage electricity, led to the discover that both time and space could be deformed, so long as a door was crated that lead to another time. This discover led Telsa to realize that discover though his own personal experiences could lead to traveling through time. In March of 1985 Telsa underwent an experiment that resulted in him being hit with 3.5 million volts of electricity. Sitting in a café at the time, having just underwent the experiment, he told a New York Herald reporter that he had advised that he would not be the ‘most pleasant company to be around due to the face he had almost died.’ When interviewed about the incident, Tesla described a 3-foot spark that had jumped into the air threatening all within its reach. He stated had it not been for a brave assistant at the time, moving to shut off the power as quickly as possible, he may very well have been killed by the impact.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! The U.S. government has quietly spent millions of taxpayer dollars to destabilize the democratically elected, center-right government in Macedonia by colluding with leftwing billionaire philanthropist George Soros, records obtained by Judicial Watch show. Barack Obama’s U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, Jess L. Baily, has worked behind the scenes with Soros’ Open Society Foundation to funnel large sums of American dollars for the cause, constituting an interference of the U.S. Ambassador in domestic political affairs in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The cash flows through the State Department and the famously corrupt U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID), which is charged with providing global economic, development and humanitarian assistance. USAID has allocated about $5 million to leftwing Soros groups in Macedonia since 2012, documents show, and at least $9.5 million has been earmarked by the agency to intervene in the Balkan nation’s governmental affairs for 2016-2021. State Department figures have been tougher to come by and Judicial Watch has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the numbers. Judicial Watch also fired off a public records request to USAID because the preliminary figures, obtained through various sources in both the U.S. and Macedonia, appear to be incomplete. Here’s how the clandestine operation functions, according to high-level sources in Macedonia and the U.S. that have provided Judicial Watch with records as part of an ongoing investigation. The Open Society Foundation has established and funded dozens of leftwing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Macedonia to overthrow the conservative government. One Macedonian government official interviewed by Judicial Watch in Washington D.C. recently, calls it the “Soros infantry.” The groups organize youth movements, create influential media outlets and organize violent protests to undermine the institutions and policies implemented by the government. One of the Soros’ groups funded the translation and publication of Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” into Macedonian. The book is a tactical manual of subversion, provides direct advice for radical street protests and proclaims Lucifer to be the first radical. Thanks to Obama’s ambassador, who has not been replaced by President Trump, Uncle Sam keeps the money flowing so the groups can continue operating and recruiting, sources in Macedonia and the U.S. confirm. With a population of about 2 million, Macedonia has one of the more conservative governments in Europe. This includes the lowest flat tax in Europe, close ties with Israel and pro-life policies. The country recently built a border fence to crackdown on an illegal immigration crisis that overwhelmed law enforcement agencies. Between 10,000 and 12,000 illegal aliens were crossing the Greek-Macedonian border daily at the peak of the European migration crisis, a Macedonian official told Judicial Watch, and the impact was devastating. This is likely of big interest to Soros, a renowned open borders advocate who pushes international governance, diminished U.S. global power and an increase in Muslim immigration. Soros spent tens of millions of dollars to support Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Just this month Hungary’s prime minister lashed out against Soros for funding groups to secretly influence the country’s politics. “Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters,” said Viktor Orban in his annual state of the nation speech. “", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Regaining Your Confidence by Carl Greer, PhD, PsyD Do you lose confidence after a loss or failure? If it’s a particularly big loss or failure, or part of a series of failures, it may be difficult to have faith in yourself afterward. Lost confidence can affect you for years and become embedded in your story as a recurring theme that seems to have a life of its own. Even if you try to hide your insecurity, others may pick up on it because you telegraph it though your words, actions, attitudes, and body language. Then, no matter how much you try, you seem to have bad luck. You sabotage your successes and don’t know why. Failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We’ve all known someone who seems to have an air of desperation and fear about achieving a goal—and that person may be us! Most have experienced a loss of confidence and a resulting fear that we’ll never get it back. It can be helpful to think of lost confidence as a lost soul part that separated from you and can be reclaimed and reabsorbed and reintegrated into who you are. Through discovering the part of yourself that has confidence in some arena, you can reclaim the energy of confidence and let it propel you forward. If you have failed at business after business or job after job, you might spend some time pursuing an interest that you have achieved success in. You might even discover the seed for a new business. Many entrepreneurs have built successful businesses around a talent or skill they had previously undervalued. Then too, the energetic imprint of being a failure is simply an aspect of being vulnerable. When we feel insecure, we’re recognizing that we don’t have expertise, that our control is limited, and that we have much to learn. Vulnerability and what the Buddhists call ‘beginner’s mind’ can be an asset if you need to learn something new. Confidence may build as you achieve mastery. Recognizing that you are not a master is the first step in becoming one. You may need to learn more about developing a healthy relationship or business partnership. You may need to learn the art of tolerating your discomfort in discovering your weaknesses and holes in your understanding.

There is a current real problem and threat to America’s financial well-being and cultural stability. This invasion from Mexico has reached epidemic proportions and no one in power seems to even notice there is a problem. Don’t be fooled by all the media hype. Border crashers are ILLEGAL and they are ALIENS to this country. A few years back, political correctness tried to tone down the harshness and began calling them illegal immigrants. Now they even resent this label. Well, either they are illegal or they are not. The next step is to call them unauthorized immigrants which eventually will be followed by the title unauthorized Americans or Americans without citizenship. They are already referred to as undocumented workers. I for one am sick and tired of Mexico sending troops in to take over. Notice, I did not say I was sick of Mexicans. I am tired of the ILLEGAL (there’s that word again) ones. I am tired of them breaking the law and bypassing the legal steps to become citizens. I am tired of them demanding amnesty or immediate citizenship, as if it is their right by virtue of their presence in this country. It is a slap in the face to those who obey the law and earn legitimate citizenship. People who become Americans are supposed to learn the language, pass tests, and have a knowledge of our history and political system so they can appreciate and respect this country and be assimilated into American culture. In years past, during the time of real immigration at Ellis Island, America was known as the melting pot. If immigrants do not melt into the pot, then the pot ceases to be one pot of unity, creating many pots of individual cultures of division. America has ceased to be unique and is losing her identity. I am tired of real, genuine, bona fide Americans being called racist when they speak the truth on this issue. More and more ILLEGALS are attending the Jackson/Sharpton race card playing school and learning the lingo. I wish they would spend as much time learning English…....and abiding by the law. I am tired of the law not being enforced. Call me crazy, but shouldn’t illegals be arrested and deported? I am tired of Republicans and Democrats selling us down the river as they flip and flop around with spines of jelly. It has always amazed me how most politicians can stand erect on two legs without falling. It takes a spine, so how do they even walk upright? I’m tired of the accusation of not acting like a Christian about the situation. Being Christian means following the law. Why is it Christians are always supposed to do the right thing, but lawbreakers are exempt? I am tired of being told by computers, when making a phone call, to press “one” to continue in English. EVERYTHING should automatically be in English, with an option to press “one” if Spanish is needed. I am tired of illegals having access to government services funded by Americans. Basically, I am tired of being told I am the bad guy and America is the problem. As I read somewhere recently, America is a private country with borders and laws, not a public park with open access.

Growing up in a Catholic household, I knew that it was so shameful. And I still feel so much shame around that now. I was so young; I don’t know why I did it. Mary Magdalene: Thank you for speaking this. When one has shame, even speaking it is difficult because there is so much fear about being ostracized, being abandoned if you show people the part of yourself that you feel shame for. So speaking about it is the beginning of healing. It shows that, first, you’ve become aware and honest with yourself that this is what’s going on, that you have these areas that you have shame about. Then you begin to find people who you can trust, who it’s safe to share this with and open up this part of yourself to them. That, in and of itself, is a great step of healing. You need to have discernment in speaking to others about this. It is important to only open yourself up with people who you discern that are safe. There are people who it may not be safe to open up to, people who may not understand or hold these events in the same way you do. It is not necessary or even wise for you to open up to those people. You can be in choice about who the people are who are safe for you to open up to, the people who will be supportive for you to open up to, who actually will help you in the ways that you are wanting help. So be very aware of your choice and start to empower yourself to be in choice rather than being at the effect of random responses from random individuals. How does that part feel to you? Questioner: That feels good. That gives me a lot of security and guidance. Mary Magdalene: Yes. This is the beginning of reclaiming your own personal power. When there’s shame, you have given away a part of your power to someone or some entity that you probably trusted. Now, at the stage of life you’re currently in, you may realize that they weren’t entirely trustable or they weren’t entirely for your highest good. They gave you messages that what you were doing was bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or that somehow you, yourself, were bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or deficient, not right, not good enough because you were engaging certain behaviors. This is a very sad state of affairs. It is a very third-dimensional issue because in the third-dimensional consciousness there is a very strong belief in these dualities of good-bad, right-wrong, evil-godly, those kinds of things. At the higher dimensions, we see things very differently. We see those kinds of dualities as quite destructive, quite harmful to people’s spiritual growth and their spiritual path. Part of the spiritual process at the third dimension is realizing that many people have been programmed with this kind of thinking that certain things are good and certain things are bad; certain things are godly and certain things are ungodly; that kind of thing. Those beliefs are not a given. It is a choice to hold such beliefs. I would like to suggest a very different possibility, which from my point of view is part of the transcendence of the third dimension and moving into a higher-dimensional consciousness. That possibility is to see that there is no such thing as good-bad. There is no such thing as right-wrong. All there are is experiences that", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Losing in the next Fourth Turning could mean something incomparably worse. It could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence – perhaps even our nation – might never recover.” – Strauss & Howe – The Fourth Turning The most important point to comprehend is the death of the existing social order always occurs during the course of a Fourth Turning. Thus far, those constituting the Deep State hierarchy have fended off their demise. They are utilizing every tool at their disposal to retain their wealth, power and control. As their mass media propaganda machine falters, they have redoubled their rigging of financial markets to promote a narrative of economic recovery, while further enriching themselves and their cronies. It is clear they have reached the peak of financial manipulation, money printing, and artificial interest rate suppression. The narrative is faltering. Their last and final option to retain power is war. As their “everything bubble” (stocks, bonds, real estate) inevitably implodes, civil and/or global military conflict will be utilized to distract the populace from their Deep State domestic disasters. The time for compromise is long past. There are no moderates left in the political spectrum. The mood of the country is clearly trending towards conflict. Trump, as the grey champion of this Fourth Turning, has proven to be a lightning rod of hate. He infuriates his political opponents, the left wing media, many in his own party, foreign leaders, billionaires and most worrisome to his well-being – the shadowy surveillance state intel operatives. His own FBI and CIA have been subverting his presidency and attempting to initiate his impeachment or as a last resort – coup. After running a campaign championing a reduction in foreign military intervention in the Middle East, reducing commitments to NATO and increasing cooperation with Russia, it appears Trump has been taken into a room and told the military industrial complex calls the shots. Trump has clearly made a self-preservation decision to avoid being JFK’d. The possibility of global catastrophe is not taken seriously by the vast majority of Americans. It’s been over seventy years since the last global conflict and most of the people who experienced the horror are dead. We’ve forgotten the past and are condemned to relive it, just as we do every eighty or so years. The lack of volatility in financial markets portends drastic levels of volatility as the perception markets can’t fall has lured Wall Street 30 something MBAs and the investor class into a sense of invincibility. Geopolitical tensions have been rising dramatically over the last few years, with religious extremism, oil, petro-dollar, historical rivalries and nationalism driving the world towards conflict. These extreme economic and geopolitical stresses are coinciding along the same timeline and will erupt simultaneously, catalyzing the climactic half of this Fourth Turning. “The risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule. If there is a war, it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort – in other", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Liberals have falsely indoctrinated many black Americans to believe it represents racism, bigotry, and a painful reminder of slavery. But white Christian Southerners who fly the Confederate Battle Flag are not the enemy of responsible Black Americans who are working to better themselves. The Confederate flag is the last flag to represent the concept of local control of ones’ life in America. In a larger sense it represents the same values and principles as the original U.S. Betsy Ross Flag: Limited Constitutional Federal Government, States Rights, Resistance to Tyranny, and Christian Principles and Values. Thus it represents “government of the people, by the people, and for the people with the consent of the governed”. The Confederate flag is an internationally recognized symbol of resistance to tyranny. That is why it was flying over the Berlin Wall when it was being torn down in 1989 and has been flown by numerous countries or provinces seeking independence. It reminds knowledgeable Americans that government is to be held accountable for its actions, and if those actions are viewed as not being in the best interest of the people, there is a price to be paid for it. This fact has not been lost upon the Socialist, Communist, liberal left and that is why they have spent inordinate amounts of money and energy trying to suppress this powerful symbol of freedom. The Confederate battle flag is a Christian symbol and that is why proponents of Secular Humanism (the belief that there is no God and man, science, and government can solve all problems) oppose it. The flag also represents the valor and sacrifice of our Southern ancestors in their quest to gain independence and recognition as a sovereign nation. Confederate soldiers displayed tremendous bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and blatant tyranny and aggression on behalf of the Yankee government that invaded the Southern homeland. It was, is, and will continue to be the flag of the region Southerners call home, the Southland. We are Americans, true, but we are also proud Southerners. James W.

They’re undertaken in full daylight, boldly, by those in charge. And, usually, they start to involve victimizing kids — not so much because it’s easier (it’s plenty easy to victimize adults when nobody goes to prison and you’ve turned every man into a eunuch on top of it) but because you start to run out of adults to vicimize so all that’s left is kids. The poster child for this is of course Zuckerberg and Facebook, which the founding President of has admitted uses psychological trickery to addict people to the site, and now has chosen to abuse children. You’d think that when a business starts peddling the equivalent of drugs to kids that the cops would show up, haul everyone involved off in chains and destroy the company involved but you’d be wrong — Facebook’s stock closed at $172 yesterday, for a market cap of $502 billion. Every single penny of that should be forfeit right here, right now. Oh, speaking of abusing children, if you’re a sorta little guy you might get arrested for prostituting kids. Maybe. It seems that being a State Senator is not far enough up the power ladder to evade going to jail. I hope that guy has a nice supply of Vasoline, as I have been told prison inmates just loooove those who like to screw kids. Now about Zucker****er; yeah, I know, it’s not sex — just totally buttraping the future of said kids by diddling their minds so it doesn’t count…. right? It’s just Facebook you say, or some State Senator? Uh, no. How about Google and Youtube?

They flagged one of my daughter’s — which featured…… wait for it…… a hike up a hill with her pussy…… CAT. There was utterly nothing objectionable in any way, shape or form in that video, but since she was out of town and I noted the lack of ads I filed the protest for her. They turned it back on. Instead of looking before killing it in the first place, of course, they just used a computer to do it, you see, because 30 seconds of actual looking would have disclosed….. a cat and a hike. It also would have meant Google would have made a bit less money to actually employ people, and, well, we can’t have that. Jobs? Forget about it. Then there’s Chicago and Goldman’s latest fraud, and what a doozey that one is.

But even more because the cultural romance of Crimea. The site, I mean the home of Chekov’s dacha was in Yalta. It’s iconic in Russian history, Russian culture and Russian sentiment. It wasn’t just the naval base at Sebastopol which was vitally important, although the Russians which had been leasing the naval base and by the way what happened at Maidan called into question whether Kiev would honor that long term lease any longer. You’re absolutely right about that. Russia was building in the far north an alternative naval base. I mean technically it could have replicated Crimea strategically it could have done this but it could never have replicated Crimea in the hearts and minds of Russians. And, as poll after poll and the referendum showed in the hearts and minds of some 80 percent of the Crimean people. Now Crimea also has Tartar Crimeans and Ukrainians who don’t share this view. But the overwhelming majority of Crimeans who were born there or moved there or lived there for decades, that was their sentiment. Now here’s the political background. Nonetheless in all the years I’ve followed post Soviet Russia, beginning in 1991, I never saw any Kremlin leadership give any indication that it was going to take Crimea back. Let me repeat that. You could not find, certainly not in the public record…who knows what…dreams…you know these kinds of people have in the Pentagon and elsewhere secretly in the dark of the night. But neither Yeltsin nor Putin ever gave any public support to the idea which you could find in Moscow and some intellectual circles that you know, Crimea is ours. In fact, at one point they needed to draw new maps because Crimea was now no longer in Russia after 1991. And Putin wrote to the president of Crimea…I don’t recall which one it was saying “hey our map people want to get on with the new maps could you get your map people to work with them because there’s a number of borders that aren’t clear and we’ve got to clarify them”. And he got no response. In other words, the notion that Crimea might be taken or even negotiated back into Russia simply was not on the political agenda for the Kremlin under Putin until 2014.

Professor Cohen had some thoughts there, too. I’m not a Trump supporter and I didn’t vote for him. However, we can actually support Donald Trump’s campaign promise which I think he’s tried to act on since he’s been president that it’s necessary to cooperate with Russia. This is what was called detente in the 20th century. I don’t know why Trump doesn’t make this point. I don’t think he has very good advisors in regard to Russia either in terms of what’s going on in Russia or in terms of his own policy making but Trump might say in his own defense because they’re indicting him for simply saying I want to cooperate with Russia and with Putin in particular.

Marxism spawned Socialism. Marxism produced the foundation of European welfare state socialism. The European model tried to nationalize Socialism, as with the Bolshevik revolution, but with less success. After the failure of nationalization through revolution, European socialists realized that free enterprise in private hands produced capital (money) which they could then steal through taxation and then redistribute to all through social programs, thereby achieving socialism. Where European socialism prevails, there is a cost. According to Paul Roderick Gregory, “The European welfare state takes one half of national output to provide state health care, pensions, extended unemployment benefits, income grants, and free higher education.” Obama feverishly promotes socialism as just described. Fairness is the vehicle Obama uses to implement socialism. He just wants to be fair and for everyone to have a level playing field. Fairness is the mantra of socialists. Fairness in healthcare, fair share of tax payments, fair prices for all through state controlled markets, fairness for the environment through green energy, racial fairness through enforced civil rights, fairness in gender equality and protection of homosexuality through tough hate crime laws, to name a few. All of this fairness must be executed and enforced through an all-powerful centralized government by controlling everyone to be able to provide all of life’s needs from the cradle to the grave. This is Obama European Socialism pure and simple and he is lying when saying he does not want to redistribute wealth. Redistribution is the cornerstone of socialism. And herein lies the reason why Obama hates the Constitution. The Constitution of the United States of America is the death blow to socialism. The Constitution limits government and empowers the individual while protecting individual liberty. Socialism is not compatible with a limited government and free citizens who govern themselves.

It hates President Trump, Strives to undermine Israel, Defames Victor Orban, Seeks to bring Poland to its knees--Because of its striving for striving for sovereignty Neo-Stalinism and the Polish Challenge Courts have been turned into leverage for destruction of national democracies by the totalitarian system In late December, the European Commission announced punitive measures against Poland using the so-called “nuclear option”, Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty. The reason was the decision of Warsaw to limit the power of judges. The EU considered this an infringement on “freedom, democracy and the rule of law”. In fact, the “nuclear option” of the EU has no relation to freedom, democracy, or the rule of law. Its goal is to establish a totalitarian supranational system in Poland, the leading country of the Visegrad Fronde, in order to supersede democratic national institutions of power. The judicial system in a democratic state should guard rights of citizens. Together with the executive and legislative powers, it must guarantee “the enjoyment of life and liberty” of free citizens (The Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776), or according to Jeremy Bentham, the founder of British utilitarianism, ensure “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”. The problem is that judges have real and huge power. However unlike heads of states, governments and parliamentarians, they are not elected by anyone, which provides a solid ground for manipulation. Today, the judicial system has turned into a disgusting parody of itself; supported by politicians, Academia, media and NGOs, it is now a powerful lever used by prominent people to promote the ideology of political correctness and multiculturalism. The goal of this ideology is ethnic and cultural substitution and, as a consequence, Islamization. It is not actively displayed, although it is not concealed. In 2001, the former French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement called for integration of 75 million migrants from Africa and Asia within 50 years. In July 2008, the Chief Justice of England and Wales Lord Phillips declared that it was inevitable to recognize Sharia courts in Great Britain. In September 2015, at the peak of the crisis with migrants, the journalist Ralf Schuler (“Bild”) reported the EU was planning to receive an additional 5 million refugees from Asia and Africa. In September 2017, the EU financed the exhibition in Brussels called “Islam, It’s Also Our History!”. According to Isabelle Benoit, a historian from the Tempora organization, “We want to make it clear to Europeans that Islam is a part of our civilization”. On February 22, President of France Emmanuel Macron said: “French culture does not exist. There is a culture in France and it is diverse… French art? I have never seen it!”. According to Finance Minister of Germany Wolfgang Sch√§uble, Germans need to learn humanistic values of Islam, and Islam is “a constituent part of Germany”. This aim is realized in three stages. Stage one - corruption of society, imposition of barbarous archaic customs, destruction of the national culture, eradication of Judeo-Christian values. Stage two - support of Islamic occupation and migrant violence, legalization of the Sharia. Stage three - suppression of dissent at all levels. It is obvious that a healthy and cohesive society would resist turning it into slavery.", "_diversity_score": 9.461294703485741}

HUD officials also disregarded the report’s most critical observation that, “the MTO experimental design cannot be used to conclusively establish that childhood exposure to a better environment has a causal effect on long-term outcomes…” HUD is proceeding with a program that, after 15 years, researchers can show no conclusive proof works. There are broader concerns. The administration ignores aggressive pursuit of methods to reduce the incidence of single parent families, and increase local educational opportunities, even though researchers recognize both as solutions to improving educational outcomes that are more important than incomes. Is HUD even within its legal bounds? HUD is advancing the MTO program under its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule. Yet, nothing in the Fair Housing Act entitles HUD to transfer people to gain income integration, nor engage in many of the actions they are taking under AFFH. Continued below... Hear no research, see no research HUD and the Department of Education believe poor student performance is primarily the result of living in concentrated areas of poverty. To remedy this, the agency intends to relocate low-income families to better neighborhoods to improve educational and income outcomes. To a low-income family, this seems like a boon. Who would not want to move to a nicer area, especially if someone else is paying for it? But, to conclude that moving to affluent areas is the best solution to improve outcomes, HUD had to ignore volumes of research findings that prove location is not the prime driver of scholastic ability. Moving families to locations where adults and children have no friends or relatives in areas they cannot afford, brings its own challenges. The 2011 study, “The Effects of Poverty on Academic Achievement” concludes that income and a mother’s level of education are the significant factors in determining educational outcomes. “In many studies, mother’s education had a more significant effect on children’s scores than income.” The author’s recommend that “instructional techniques and strategies can help close the achievement gap by providing students with necessary assistance in order to achieve high standards in academic performance.” There is no recommendation to uproot families and move them to more affluent areas. A 2014 study, sponsored by the prestigious Harvard Program on Education Policy and Governance, and Education Next, reveals that a child’s educational disadvantages are more the result of their parents’ educational levels than where they live. “Among students from families with low parental education, U.S. literacy proficiency is a disastrous 18 percent, far below the 42 percent mark reached by students with high parent education.” While pursuing income diversity, HUD ignores that the best way to improve grades and opportunities is not to shuffle families into new neighborhoods, but to educate families about the importance of two-parent households, the effects of fathers on children’s education, and the value of education for all family members. Instead, HUD, DOT and the Department of Education are moving ahead with regional Equity Assistance Centers as part of President Obama’s Stronger Together program, (see page", "_diversity_score": 9.461294703485741}

This could mean you are being psychically attacked and you need to know how to combat these things. If you think negative thoughts or psychic attacks are being pushed onto you then you need to do something about them. While you cannot stop them from happening, you can keep them from controlling your life. These things come from others and are often unintentional. You see, when someone is jealous of you or even doesn’t like you the things they put out into this world have more power than they realize. Below you will find a list of things that can and will help you when these situations arise. 6 Things to Do When You Feel Psychic Attacks Heading Your Way: This is a pretty popular practice. During meditation imagine a white light at your solar plexus chakra point and allow it to expand ever so gently. With each breath, it will grow brighter. Once it expands beyond the borders of your body you will begin to notice a difference. Think of this as a means of clearing away the negative feelings attacking your body. This is known as smudging. I suggest using white sage as it is the most easily accessible and will do the job. Cleanse your person and your home. This will rid you of any negativity that may have been lingering. You can do your own research and figure out which crystals work best for you specifically but for me, black tourmaline works wonders. I carry this in my pocket every single day. Once you get into the swing of carrying crystals you will notice a big change. 4. Enforce healthy boundaries. If you find these attacks are coming from a specific person limit their presence in your life. No one should be able to hold power over your being. If they are bringing you down cutting them out is essential. 5. Make it clear you will no longer be affected. Tell yourself verbally that you will no longer let these attacks bother you or affect your life. This is setting your intentions and making it clear that you will not be broken. As mentioned above the things we put out in the world hold more power than we realize. 6. Meditate more often to strengthen your aura. Meditate as much as you can. Clear your mind and really work to bring a deeper sense of strength to your aura. This is much easier than it sounds.", "_diversity_score": 41.06090373280943, "_bm25_score": 9.739760357670002, "_rank": 1, "_combined_score": 8.173080914980254, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.8554319931565441}

Add your two cents. Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Congress has demanded that the Department of Justice turn over all documents related to a disturbing report from POLITICO that the Obama administration quashed a massive DEA investigation into a $200 million per month drug trafficking and money laundering scheme on U.S. soil which was directly funding Hezbollah’s various terror campaigns around the world. “Add this to the long list of concessions the Obama administration made in pursuit of the nuclear agreement with Iran,” said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter. “The difference here is that this wasn’t just bad policy—it was potentially criminal. Congress absolutely has a responsibility to get to the bottom of this.” The letter follows a commitment made by congressional leaders to open an investigation into the explosive claims of what is being described as a “potentially criminal” enterprise described to the Free Beacon by a congressional source as an offshoot of Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran which saw $1.7 billion dollars of euros, Swiss francs and other currencies shipped directly to Tehran on wooden pallets. In early 2016, French police smashed a Hezbollah cell accused of trafficking cocaine for one of the world’s most ruthless drug cartels in order to fund the militant group’s operations in Syria. The Telegraph reported at the time: The agents, arrested in France, allegedly masterminded a massive global drug ring which raised millions of dollars to arm Hizbollah gunmen fighting for Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, in Syria. Two years ago, one of the outfit’s sicarios, or hitmen, was arrested in Spain on suspicion of having ordered up to 400 murders worldwide. The Hizbollah agents detained by French police include alleged leaders of the group’s European cell, including 45-year-old businessman Mohamad Noureddine. The DEA, which has classified him as a “specially-designated global terrorist”, accuses him of being a Lebanese money launderer for Hizbollah’s financial arm. A DEA statement said: “These proceeds are used to purchase weapons for Hizbollah for its activities in Syria. This ongoing investigation…once again highlights the dangerous global nexus between drug trafficking and terrorism.” Despite the active and ongoing DEA investigations into Hezbollah’s global operations, the Obama administration “threw an increasingly insurmountable series of roadblocks in its way” according to Politico. In a Thursday letter from Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Congress demanded all communications and documents related to the DEA’s “Project Cassandra” campaign which targeted “a global Hizbollah network responsible for the movement of large quantities of cocaine in the United States and Europe,” along with information on operations “Titan” and “Perseus,” as well as the Lebanese Canadian Bank, The Iran-Hezbollah Super Facilitator Initiative, and several named individuals. Also sought are “all documents and communications referring or relating to the potential designation of Hezbollah as a Transnational Criminal Organization,” along with “all documents referring or relating to efforts to prosecute targets related to Hezbolah” via the RICO act. “We have a responsibility to evaluate whether these allegations are true, and if so, did the administration undermine U", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Most security systems in the United States, and elsewhere in the world, were designed 25 or more years ago. While some improvements have been made (WIFI digital cameras replacing old analog cameras), overall the nature of these systems has not changed much. What they offer are “pictures” from different cameras that are flashed across a computer screen or a TV monitor. Someone in a command center is supposed to watch these pictures and sound an alarm if something happens and if they “see” it. This type of security “system” primarily is valuable for collecting forensic information after an incident or suspect intrusion. There the video feed can be examined. Even in London, one of the most wired-up cities in the world, it takes police anywhere from hours to days to make use of surveillance camera video footage as an aid to apprehending a terrorist. Obviously, that is helpful, but it would be better if the camera feed could be accessed in a more direct fashion. An Israeli inventor who was the lead manager for installing security systems in 25 sensitive Israeli villages and who also built a security system for a prison along the Egyptian border (to keep terrorists out, not just to keep prisoners in), saw this weakness in current security systems and set out to fix the problem. His name is Eran Jedwab and his product is called JedEye. It is the first system to bolt onto traditional security systems and provide security guards and police with real-time situational awareness of a threat including full visualization of a facility or campus. The system is now being installed at locations in the United States. Other technologies also could be very useful, but promoting them has been a “hard sell” in the United States. One of them is gunshot detectors. Gunshot detectors can actually locate a shooter in a millisecond, can aim cameras in the shooter’s location and can even be slaved to sniper rifles in the hands of law enforcement. While gunshot detectors in the past are fixed in place, today mobile gunshot detectors can be mounted on police vehicles. There are a few companies that offer such products including Shotspotter in Newark, California and Safety Dynamics in Tucson, Arizona. Had a mobile gunshot detector been in Las Vegas, the shooter would have been accurately located immediately. It would help a great deal if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was more proactive in sponsoring and testing new technology aimed at reducing the time it takes to neutralize an active shooter or an intruder. While DHS (through the TSA) has spent heavily on airport passenger and baggage security systems, much of the rest has been underfunded or neglected. Now is the time for DHS, supported by the Congress, to go into high gear in sponsoring solutions that reduce the time it takes to stop a terrorist. http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2017/10/the_time_factor_and_active_shooter_incidents.html#ixzz4uZCtRvE9 Read more great articles here: http://americanthinker.com", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

And you have this demand that is being driven or really being fed by credit. Now you see the credit numbers start to slow. They’re unsustainable. You start to see the consumer roll over a little bit. So that’s the number one risk to the stock market; it’s actually the consumer. If you look at the retail sales numbers, outside of automobiles and gasoline, which is price-based, you don’t have much of anything. And you have eating and drinking growth slowing. That’s a key component, a key layer to the discretionary spending that’s an important tell to the bigger picture. The consumer discretionary sector is breaking down against the S&P. So that’s a warning sign to me. You have, in terms of the dynamics around what the expectation is for GDP growth, predicated upon policies that have not yet been even agreed upon, let alone voted upon, let alone implemented, let alone starting to work. So, I worry about that kind of fracture between the expectations, the patience level of stock investors, diminished returns, diminished volumes. I think there’s a stock market risk. That’s one of the reasons we like gold, because what would go hand in hand with that, was some kind of maybe statement or a pull back on the dot plot from the Fed that would then cause the dollar to come off its little rally here. Mike Gleason: Let’s play the devil’s advocate maybe a little here. We look at these record stock prices and wonder about what is beyond this extraordinarily high valuations in the past when PE ratios hit these levels, it was a signal that markets were nearing a top. But there’s one big difference between the past and today: the advent of high frequency and machine-driven trading. Huge amounts of daily volume is generated by trading algorithms. That is a game changer. These programs don’t sense risk on an emotional level like human traders do. They respond very differently to geopolitical events. So, if today’s markets seem disconnected from reality, perhaps because it’s because they are. Now you have been on the front lines, trading in these markets for decades. You were a witness for how markets have transformed in recent years. What is your take on high frequency and algorithmic trading and what does it say about the possibility that current equity market valuations can be sustained or maybe even pushed higher? What are your thoughts there, Greg? Greg Weldon: That’s phenomenal question and it’s very well timed given that we did a big special in September called “Shrinkage,” which is a shift in the Fed policy here. But if you take now your question, which is pertinent now, and you look at experience, in my experience over decades, it brings back 1987 right off the bat. We’re not saying the market’s going to crash. There clearly there are a lot of differences. But when you ask about high frequency trading, it sounds to me, the first thing I think of, is portfolio insurance on steroids, times a thousand, times ten thousand. So, the risk in terms of just what is the catalyst that then causes kind of that cascading downside?

I can trace my roots back to the 1690’s in North Carolina, arriving from Scotland. In the late 1700’s, my family obtained a meager bit of land in Alabama (while it was still a territory… before statehood). They worked that land, surviving many hardships and early deaths. Yet they continued to prosper and grow the family, just like you saw in Little House on the Prairie. My family built that state. My family built the south. My family built this nation. My roots are this nation’s roots. In all the work my Dad did to trace our lineage, never once did he mention fighting for slavery, nor did my family own slaves. These southern men fought against unconstitutional aggression from a murderous, tyrannical, thieving Empire. These men fought to protect themselves and their families from the bloodthirsty onslaught by northerners who had no business coming into their lands to kill, plunder and devastate for Empire. I had many relatives that fought and died for the Confederacy. Not a single one fought and died for “slavery”. As a matter of fact, many despised slavery because it caused wages to be artificially low. Who would pay a decent wage when they could have the work done by slaves? (One could look at today’s prison workers to see the idea at work) The only law that was applicable was The Constitution. Yet there was no constitutional reason for Lincoln’s actions. But there was constitutional rationale for the south to secede. If anyone was breaking any laws, it was Lincoln, by starting a war and invading lands that were constitutionally protected to secede if that was their choice. Why is the Constitution’s Preamble significant? It lays out the rationale for the Constitution. I chose the one word to highlight, because I can lay claim to that word and its meaning. As a man whose family built this country and has fought and died for this country over hundreds of years, I can explain what “posterity” in this context means. It means my genetic offspring. It means my ancestors and their children and their children and ME and my children. It also represents my wife’s family who are descendents of the Adams Presidents. Very few can make these claims and if there is anyone that has a right to speak out about current events intent on erasing our heritage, by God, it is us. And we make no apologies for it. Many people come here and LEGALLY become citizens. Fine and dandy. I am a product of a person coming here from post WWII Germany (marrying my father who was stationed there and met her).

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! CIA Refuses To Show Evidence Linking Trump To Russia Because It Would Help Russia! In the weeks subsequently after Donald Trump was elected president, CIA analysts who work on Russia refreshed their analysis about Russian cyber meddling. They earlier had considered that Russia was attempting to undermine the U.S. presidential election, but after Nov. 8 they came to assume that Russian interference was truly created to help Trump win. This latest finding fertilized an currently blazing public argument between the U.S. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over Russian interference in the election. “I don’t believe it,” Trump stated in an interview shown Sunday on Fox News, discussing the idea that the Russians desired to assist him. “I think it’s ridiculous.” Trump and his aides deny not just the CIA’s updated review about Russian objectives, but the early consensus reached by all 17 agencies, and revealed in a rare joint public statement by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and DHS head Jeh Johnson, that Russia was meddling in the election in the first place. The significance of the gulf can barely be overstated: numerous foreign policy experts and lawmakers think Russia’s behavior was an assault on the nation. One ex – CIA leader, Hillary Clinton advocate Michael Morell, compared Russia’s invasion into U.S. politics Friday to “the political equivalent of 9/11.” The truth is, the CIA’s latest take is not the unanimous perspective of the intelligence community. Clapper, who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, had sufficient confidence to exchange the CIA’s review to Congress in a secret briefing last week. But no similar review has leaked from any of the other 16 intelligence agencies. The FBI, for its portion, determines that Russia’s main goal was to stow mayhem and challenge American democracy, a senior law enforcement official explained to NBC News. Aiding Trump provided that objective, the official stated, but Russia didn’t anticipate Trump to win the election. The CIA’s review that the Russians preferred Trump was not determined by any single piece of new intelligence, officials briefed on the matter explained to NBC News. Rather, it was the outcome of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial proof more comprehensive than anything the public has observed. Human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have permitted analysts to piece together the details of some of the players, and the steps they took to harm Clinton’s candidacy while boosting Trump’s, officials stated. The CIA also believed that while Russian hackers collected information on Republicans, they did not release any of it, the way they did with Democratic emails leaked to WikiLeaks. The Republican National Committee rejects its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual Republicans were collected-something NBC News documented in October. The FBI is convinced the Russians did not find anything volatile in the Republican material they acquired, the official stated, despite the fact that it’s not apparent whether any U.S. agency understands the full extent of what data Russian hackers were capable to steal. The CIA also tracked a campaign of anti-Clinton news reports amplified by social media, some of which came from Russian state media outlets, officials shared with NBC News. The case that the Russian campaign was clearly supposed to elect Trump is not something the U.S. could demonstrate in court, officials point out, which in part clarifies why FBI briefers have been more hesitant to embrace that situation in secret briefings to Congress than have intelligence", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

The study finds that in 2015, Canada had just 2.7 doctors per 1,000 people. That’s almost 20 per cent lower than the 3.4 per 1,000 person average for the other developed countries in the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed high-income countries like Canada. Crucially, projecting the number of doctors in Canada into future years—assuming current medical school enrolment and foreign-trained doctor trends continue—Canada will have 2.97 doctors per 1,000 people by 2030, still well below the 2015 OECD average. “Unless current trends are reversed, an increasing scarcity of doctors looms large in Canada’s future,” Globerman said. “Policymakers should think now about how having relatively few doctors will affect Canadian patients and the health-care system more broadly.” MEDIA CONTACT: Bryn Weese, Media Relations Specialist, Fraser Institute, .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) The Fraser Institute is an independent Canadian public policy research and educational organization with offices in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal and ties to a global network of 86 think-tanks.

On inauguration day 2009, 67% of Americans said they were hopeful about the new “messiah,” 41% showing “strong support” for the newly elected resident of the people’s White House. Thirteen months later, only 23% “strongly approve” and 40% now “strongly disapprove” of the Obama administration, according to Rasmussen Daily Tracking poll, which appears much kinder towards Obama than the CBS News poll that even CBS won’t write about. No American administration is U.S. history has fallen from favor so fast… Heads are Rolling CNN reports that 63% of Americans want everyone in congress fired, which makes the “progressive” run congress even more unpopular than Obama.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! By Jim Kouri / Conservative Base On June 27, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s email server, and only a few days before she was interviewed the Justice Department and FBI. (Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting.)” – Jill Farrell, Director of Communications, Judicial Watch. Many American cops saw right through Comey’s inaction against Mrs. Clinton: He’s a dirty cop who let a major crime figure walk. On Thursday, in the middle of a number of top news stories, a well-known watchdog organization released a 29-page Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) file directly related to the controversial June 27, 2016 Phoenix, Arizona, airport tarmac tête-à-tête between then Attorney General Loretta Lynch and her boss’ predecessor former President Bill Clinton, according to Judicial Watch’s director of communications, Jill Farrell. Perusal of these latest government documents reveals that then FBI Director James Comey and his underlings were more concerned about leaks of that meeting being reported in the media than the actual Lynch-Clinton meeting itself. The new documents also show that then-FBI Director Comey seemed to learn of the meeting from news reports. The new documents were obtained by Judicial Watch in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to comply with a July 7, 2016, FOIA request seeking: All FD-302 forms prepared pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure. All records of communications between any agent, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding, concerning, or related to the aforementioned investigation. This request includes, but is not limited to, any related communications with any official, employee, or representative of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, the Democratic National Committee, and/or the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. All records related to the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016. These latest FBI documents show how the agency’s officials were concerned about a leak that Bill Clinton delayed his aircraft taking off in order to “maneuver” a private meeting with his predecessor’s attorney general. The breaking story in the Observer is seemingly confirmed and causes a flurry of emails about the source of the article. FBI official(s) write “we need to find that guy” and that the Phoenix FBI office was contacted “in an attempt to stem any further damage.” Another FBI official, working on AG Lynch’s security detail, suggests instituting non-disclosure agreements. The names of the emails authors are redacted. There are no documents showing concern about the meeting itself. The FBI has allowed itself to become as corrupt as the criminals they arrest.

Basically, what are your general thoughts on the Fed and Fed monetary policy? Clearly everyone’s favorite subject. Greg Weldon: Really, it’s two totally separate questions right now because who is Donald Trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out. I think if you look at what the Fed is saying, the Fed has been very clear. This is where (Jerome) Powell becomes, what seems to be, and I’m not saying I believe this, I’m just saying it seems that Powell’s a logical choice if, IF, your goal is to maintain policy. Thinking about bringing in a guy like (John) Taylor, and the Taylor rule and where the natural level of Fed funds should be here, he would obviously be a much more hawkish choice. While him and Trump might have really gotten along, and maybe there’s a lot Trump can learn from him, I don’t think that’s the guy Trump wants in terms of policy for trying to get his growth agenda going. In that context, how you maintain continuity, which really isn’t that bad. They’re certainly not tight and they’re not tightening to any nth degree. It’s almost Goldilocks material here, inflation aside. Powell is a logical choice because you make a headline splash, which of course he loves. You basically make a change, but you kind of keep the status quo. The other one would be (Kevin) Warsh. He was more away from QE and towards just using interest rates. He’s an interesting kind of dark horse. Yellen is certainly a dark horse. What mattes really is how does the Fed decide they’re going to deal with this inflation issue when they can’t even decide what’s causing it? Because you keep hearing transitory, idiosyncratic. These are the words that being used repeatedly, over and over and over again to describe, and you’ve had one Fed official go so far as, and even Yellen herself has made comments to the effect of, “We don’t understand why it’s not materializing.” Again, kind of back to the Taylor model, the basic rule of thumb that the Fed is counting on, i.e. hoping for, is that as the labor market continues to tighten wages, inflation will go up and that will support of a general rise in prices. The question now becomes is the natural rate of unemployment lower than we thought it was. Or, are there structural differences now, technologically based dynamics in the labor market that has hollowed out the labor market, the reason you still have participation rate while finally up a little, is still so low historically, therein lies the question. What is it kind of keeping inflation back and how does this play out? I think the employment numbers from this month, for September, were huge in the sense it was the biggest wage number … and you know how I break the number down. To the nth degree, this was the real deal. Only one month, but still the real deal, and the best wage number we’ve seen since 2007. So, will that continue? We know anecdotal evidence is there. Will this continue over the next couple of months?

Talks between Athens and its eurozone creditors have collapsed in acrimony just days before a final deadline for Greece to unlock the €7.2bn (£5.2bn) in bailout funds it needs to avoid a catastrophic debt default. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, accused the creditor powers of hidden “political motives” in their demands that Greece make further cuts to public pension payments in return for the financial aid. “We are shouldering the dignity of our people, as well as the hopes of the people of Europe,” Mr Tsipras said in a defiant statement. “We cannot ignore this responsibility. This is not a matter of ideological stubbornness. This is about democracy.” As we approach the point of no return, both sides are preparing for the endgame. In Greece, members of parliament have been studying what happened in Iceland a few years ago. Many of them believe that a Greek debt default combined with a nationalization of Greek banks and a Greek exit from the euro could set the nation back on the path to prosperity fairly rapidly. The following comes from the Telegraph… The radical wing of Greece’s Syriza party is to table plans over coming days for an Icelandic-style default and a nationalisation of the Greek banking system, deeming it pointless to continue talks with Europe’s creditor powers. Syriza sources say measures being drafted include capital controls and the establishment of a sovereign central bank able to stand behind a new financial system. While some form of dual currency might be possible in theory, such a structure would be incompatible with euro membership and would imply a rapid return to the drachma. The confidential plans were circulating over the weekend and have the backing of 30 MPs from the Aristeri Platforma or ‘Left Platform’, as well as other hard-line groupings in Syriza’s spectrum. It is understood that the nationalist ANEL party in the ruling coalition is also willing to force a rupture with creditors, if need be. Meanwhile, in a desperate attempt to get the Greeks to give in at the last moment, Greek’s creditors are preparing to pull out all the stops in order to put as much financial pressure on Greece as possible… Germany’s Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that the creditors are drawing an ultimatum to the Greeks, threatening to cut off Greek access to the European payments system and forcing capital controls on the country as soon as this weekend. The plan would lead to the temporary closure of the banks, followed by a rationing of cash withdrawals. For a long time, most in the financial world assumed that a debt deal would eventually happen. But now reality is setting in. As I mentioned at the top of this article, the cost to insure Greek debt has risen by an astounding 456 percent since the beginning of this year… Given these dramatic stakes, the risk of a Greek default has gone way up. One way to measure that risk is by looking at the skyrocketing price of insurance policies that would pay out if Greek bonds go bust. The cost to insure Greek debt for one year against the risk of default has skyrocketed 456% since the start of the 2015, according to FactSet data.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Sorry for the belated post! We spent the holidays doing fun family things, including going to the movies. This review is about the highlight of our movie-going: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, otherwise known as Episode VII. I’m assuming that everyone who wants to see it has, so I’ll let the spoilers fly. I have to say that when the movie opens and the “Star Wars” banner starts to scroll, I got a little choked up. For those of us of a certain age, Star Wars was the background of our childhood/tweendom. We were told there would be nine movies, three that preceded the original trilogy, and three that followed. As adults, we heard that the three prequels would come first. (I was a little saddened. I wasn’t as interested in how Anakin fell as how Han and Leia got married.) Then the prequels were. . well. . .awful. So, the news that in our middle age, the last three would be made was met with excitement mixed with a lot of anxiety. Would these be awful, too? Would they be all ewoks and Jar Jar? Would the acting be so bad as to make you laugh in inappropriate parts? So, with some trepidation, a generation of viewers bought tickets ahead of time to see Episode VII. And it was good. Maybe great, maybe amazing, but definitely all was good. At the end there was clapping and rejoicing, for the story but also for the sense that the movie makers (Disney now, not George Lucas) heard the fans. Understood what was so genre-defining and game-changing about Episode III. Gave the fans the story, without muppets and bad actors. If the original movie resonated with the audience’s priors about good and evil, the latest installment resonates with the audience’s need to be understood and heard. George Lucas has criticized the “retro” Episode VII for pandering to the fans. Whatever. I loved it. I walked out and wanted to walk right back in again. If you’ve seen the movie, then you can track Episode VII and Episode III and have already realized they are the same (awesome) movie. There is a bad guy, who used to be a good guy (Kylo Ren), and a bad guy mentor (Supreme Leader Snoke), who are trying to take over the galaxy under the name the First Order. There is a resistance leader who has secret information (Poe) who gives it to a droid (BB-8) to deliver it to the resistance. There are two young people who bump into BB-8′s mission (Rey and Finn) and each have their own reasons for following or wanting to leave. Both Rey and Finn have parts of Luke and Han Solo. Rey is a scavenger and a tinkerer and a pilot (like Han), but she obviously has a higher calling to the force (like Luke). Finn is moved by love (like Luke), but also has self-preservation tendencies (like Han). But they are interesting in their own right. Finn is FN-2187, a stormtrooper. These iconic troops that have been nameless and faceless to Star Wars fans now have a backstory. Finn was taken from his family by the First Order and programmed to fight.

Our money is being taken and nothing we want is being provided in return. On the contrary, they are using it for things we emphatically oppose, and strapping our citizens with unconscionable debt. They are grabbing every dollar and every ounce of credit they can to spend this country into insolvency. Now they want to increase the national debt ceiling from 12.1 trillion to 14 trillion just to cover the entitlement programs already on the books until after the coming November 2010 elections, in spite of Obama‘s 2006 statement on the Senate floor: “Raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.” The current national debt is at 12.09 trillion, and at the current rate of spending, the 12.1 trillion ceiling will be reached in January. Adding another trillion to the debt ceiling would last only until 3 months before the next election. That wouldn’t be good for Democrat re-election chances so if they increase it now by 1.9 trillion, they hope no one will notice or if they do, they won’t remember next November.

Even the TARP loan payback money that banks have repaid to the government - which was supposed to go back into the treasury to help reduce the deficit - has been stolen by the Obama regime and diverted to his government job creation program. Or in other words, to his environmental and union supporters and other special interest lobbies. Moody’s Investors Service says the U.S. and U.K. may loose their triple-A credit rating by 2013 “if economic growth lags, interest rates rise and the government fails to shrink the deficit or recover its loans to the financial sector.” Obama professes that he can solve the problem of government overspending with dramatic increases in government overspending. He prides himself on removing $100 million from a $1.2 billion wasteful spending bill. This is insane. So in a year from now, when the debt reaches 14 trillion, what then? Just do it again? Where does it end? What is the end game? When will the goal of a Cloward-Piven financial collapse finally be realized? Will it happen before the next election? How long will it be before this imitation president declares to the country that the government has no choice but to take over all private sector business and industry, and consequently redistribute the wealth, in order to “save the country” - or is it to “save the planet?” Closer to the truth would be to secure permanent political power for the socialist left. If you haven’t recognized it by now, that is the end game. We call it communism. We now have two systems working against each other: a government socialist system competing against the private sector capitalist system.

I don’t think he has very good advisors in regard to Russia either in terms of what’s going on in Russia or in terms of his own policy making but Trump might say in his own defense because they’re indicting him for simply saying I want to cooperate with Russia and with Putin in particular. He could say look, every Republican president of consequence in the 20th century pursued detente with Russia. First Eisenhower, the first detente the spirit of Camp David with Khrushchev, then the Nixon Kissinger attempt at a grand detente with Brezhnev and finally above all Ronald Reagan a detente with Gorbachev the last Soviet leader Soviet Russian leader so great that Reagan and Gorbachev ended the cold war. Trump could put himself in that tradition and say “I’m the traditional Republican. This is what Eisenhower, Nixon and Reagan did. They did it wisely. They avoided nuclear war with Russia. We’re in a new Cold War. The dangers are grave. It’s not only my duty as the American president to pursue cooperation to ward off a catastrophe but I commend the honorable tradition of the Republican Party”. He doesn’t say that. I don’t know why as I say it because he doesn’t know what or because he wants to be the one and only I have no idea what he needs to say. And if he said it it would compel a conversation in Washington that we’re not having. What’s happened to detente and what’s happened is we have if we ignore his own idiom and put it in again I speak as a story in the historical language of 20th century diplomacy. We have a pro-detente President who for the first time in history is not permitted to at least try because every time he has a sensible conversation with Putin, no matter whether it’s face to face or on the telephone, he’s accused not only by the traditionally crazies in American politics but by the New York Times of treason. So what we could do and it will be hard for a lot of people because of the loathing for Trump.

Now would enough of us do that would a few newspapers do that? Would a few of these cable TV panelists? Would they ever have panelist on who would do that? We might affect a little civic courage in Congress where a few people there would do so also.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! A REDNECK’S GUIDE TO REVERSING THEIR CONTROL OF YOUR BRAIN No matter how historically incorrect, so many people (Jews and non-Jews) cannot help but use their brainwashed minds to play the Hitler card. Case in point is Stephen Lendman’s recent post about Israeli Viciousness: Israel treats Palestinians the way Hitler persecuted Jews. Every day is Kristallnacht for long-suffering people under apartheid conditions worse than South Africa’s. This is not to say that he is incorrect about Israeli viciousness (because they are apparently vicious, murdering monsters). This is not to argue his defense of Palestinians (because I agree). But for smart people (much like Sweetie Zuesse) to continually use the standard erroneous brainwashing to bolster a point, in direct opposition to historical fact, makes them opportunists at best and liars at worst. I don’t think there is another subject so erroneously engrained within the psyche of the world as this devious Jewish one of using Hitler, the NSDAP and Germany in general, to bolster sympathy for Jews/Israel and to cover for their carnage against the world. I have shown Sweetie to be a liar several times, but Lendman (I believe) is just mistaken and found that using the meme will fortify his point. Lendman could have used another example based upon truth. Let’s be accurate, shall we? Too bad Lendman still uses the Hitler card, even when attacking Israel (and towards Jews to a small degree). But the truth is that Hitler was disgusted with those TWO nights and had nothing to do with their instigation or implementation. It was a stain to his party and totally against his direction and desires. What Really Happened During the Crystal Night Now let us look at what really happened during that fateful night. After 1945 any harm ever done to any Jew in National Socialist Germany has been described in great detail in many publications and combined with other.stories to give exaggerated figures which have then become the so-called “historical truth.” How strange it is then that despite the passage of more than forty years, no one has established the true extent of the damage done to the Jews during the Crystal Night. All one can learn from history writers is that “all” synagogues were demolished and that “all” shop windows were destroyed. Aside from this vague description, one is given almost no details. On the basis of the so-called “historical truth” about the Crystal Night, the President of the World Jewish Congress, Nahum Goldmann, had the chutzpah in 1952 to claim 500 million dollars from German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer as reparation payment for the damage done during that November night. When Adenauer asked Goldmann for his justification for this enormous request, Goldmann replied: “You find the justification yourself! What I want is not the justification but the money.” [note 7] And he got his money! Goldmann may have interpreted the willingness of the German Chancellor to pay a half billion dollars as proof for the claim that all synagogues had been destroyed. Why else would Germany be so foolish as to pay for something which never happened? All the same, the “historical truth” that “all” German synagogues were destroyed is a lie.", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303, "_bm25_score": 8.027579584878538, "_rank": 1, "_combined_score": 3.5684453874524515, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.6007810153199159}

The Four Way Test Every Rotary meeting begins with a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, reciting the Four Way Test and singing a song. Our song that day was “God Bless America”. There were sixty members from a wide range of ages, backgrounds and ethnicities, though none of that mattered. To me they were neighbors I’d never met, principled and dedicated to doing the right thing. Founded in 1905, the Rotary Club has been doing the right thing for a long time. They have 1.2 million members in 33,000 chapters on six continents. Their mission statement is to “combat hunger, improve health and sanitation, provide education and job training, promote peace and eradicate polio”. Their “Ambassadorial Scholarship” program has enabled 40,000 students from 100 countries to live for one year with a foreign family. While promoting a functional mass transit system in the early nineties I was guest speaker for fifty Rotary meetings at thirty different chapters. If there is a better path to truth and understanding than the Rotarians, then I’m not aware of it. It is certainly not articulated or practiced by either political party or the government bureaucracy. Rotary International is not a political organization and I am neither a member nor a spokesman. As just a speaker and honored guest I can state, you have no finer neighbors than these dedicated volunteer servants. There is urgent need for political reform to save America and that reform cannot be modeled on either of the existing corrupt parties. The Rotary, Lions, Optimist, Kiwanis and other service clubs are connected to the unpoisoned roots of America. I look forward to the day when all of America can embrace their spirit of service. That day when former Democrats, former Republicans and former Libertarians can stand shoulder to shoulder and sing “God Bless America”.", "_diversity_score": 9.461294703485741}

We’re not saying the market’s going to crash. There clearly there are a lot of differences. But when you ask about high frequency trading, it sounds to me, the first thing I think of, is portfolio insurance on steroids, times a thousand, times ten thousand. So, the risk in terms of just what is the catalyst that then causes kind of that cascading downside? One of the things we’ve been pointing out to our customers… and by the way, I’m working out a gigantic special that shows just how intriguing some of the similarities are around movements in the dollar, movements in bonds, movements in gold, and movements in stocks, and some of the ratios, and even down to crude oil, Fed policy and CPI. Now as there was basically from 1985 to ’87, once they kicked in the Plaza Accord, which depreciated the dollar. A lot of intriguing connections there and the special report that I’m writing on this, it’s called “What, Me Worry?” which we’d love to make available to any of your listeners, first of all, if they want to email me. But in terms of the catalyst, setting it up, again I think the landmines are laying in wait out there. I think if you take an example, one of the things, like I said we’ve been telling our customers, if you take Amazon or Google. Stock are trading at $1,000 a share. You need $1,000 to buy one share. So, the volume of trading has diminished dramatically over the last couple of years as the stock prices has gone up. The ownership is huge. And it’s passive, and it’s managed investments, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t discriminate in terms of what type of investor. The people who want to own these stocks, own them. The dynamic between the price level being so high, nominally speaking, to buy up block shares, the amount of money needed, pure and simple, against the volume, to me, sets up something like you’re talking about that would be exacerbated by a flash crash. So, it becomes very scary in terms of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball rolling to the downside. I still think that this is something that will play out over some time. I think the Fed is there. I don’t think this is … There are a lot of differences. I’m not trying to make a direct ’87 comparison. But I’ll tell you what, the risk is there. No doubt about it. The risk is rising. Mike Gleason: In terms of the Fed here, Greg, what is your thinking on who it might be that talks over for Janet Yellen as the next Fed chair and then also, tell us what you think they’re going to do here in terms of getting inflation to where they want? Basically, what are your general thoughts on the Fed and Fed monetary policy? Clearly everyone’s favorite subject. Greg Weldon: Really, it’s two totally separate questions right now because who is Donald Trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out. I think if you look at what the Fed is saying, the Fed has been very clear.

With the media content to play along, this had a twofold benefit: Obama was able (1) to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and (2) to avoid using the term “executive privilege” – with all its dark Watergate connotations – even though that was precisely what he was invoking. Note that claims of executive privilege must yield to demands for disclosure of relevant evidence in criminal prosecutions. But of course, that’s not a problem if there will be no prosecution. The White House purported to repair the president’s disingenuous statement in the CBS interview by rationalizing that he had meant that he learned of Clinton’s homebrew server system through news reports – he hadn’t meant to claim unawareness that she occasionally used private email. This was sheer misdirection: From Obama’s standpoint, the problem was that he discussed government intelligence matters with the secretary of state through a private email account; the fact that, in addition, Clinton’s private email account was connected to her own private server system, rather than some other private email service, was beside the point. But, again, the media was not interested in such distinctions and contentedly accepted the White House’s non-explanation. Meanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch ordered Comey to use the word “matter” rather than “investigation” to describe the FBI’s probe of Clinton’s email practices. This ensured that the Democratic administration’s law-enforcement agencies were aligning their story with the Democratic candidate’s campaign rhetoric. If there was no investigation, there would be no prosecution. In April 2016, in another nationally televised interview, Obama made clear that he did not want Clinton to be indicted. His rationale was a legally frivolous straw man: Clinton had not intended to harm national security. This was not an element of the felony offenses she had committed; nor was it in dispute. No matter: Obama’s analysis was the stated view of the chief executive. If, as was sure to happen, his subordinates in the executive law-enforcement agencies conformed their decisions to his stated view, there would be no prosecution. Within a few weeks, even though the investigation was ostensibly still underway and over a dozen key witnesses – including Clinton herself – had not yet been interviewed, the FBI began drafting Comey’s remarks that would close the investigation. There would be no prosecution. On June 27, Lynch met with Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, on an out-of-the-way Arizona tarmac, where their security details arranged for both their planes to be parked. Over the next few days, the FBI took pains to strike any reference to Obama’s emails with Mrs. Clinton from the statement in which Comey would effectively end the “matter” with no prosecution. On July 1, amid intense public criticism of her meeting with Bill Clinton, Attorney General Lynch piously announced that she would accept whatever recommendation the FBI director and career prosecutors made about charging Clinton. As Page told Strzok in a text that day, “This is a purposeful leak following the airplane snafu.” It was also playacting. Page elaborated that the attorney general already “knows no charges will be brought.” Of course she did: It was understood by all involved that there would be no prosecution. Knowing that, Lynch had given the FBI notice on June 30 that she’d be announcing her intention to accept Comey’s recommendation.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Let’s be honest, the domain name industry is now directly tied to Chinese domain buying and selling activity. When I first got started in the domain industry I looked at things like search volume and CPC and tried to put myself in the mind of a buyer that was looking for a domain name for their business. Fast-forward to 2016 and the average domain buyer has changed. Sure, there are still plenty of businesses buying domains to use for themselves but it’s not secret that most of the domain buying activity is coming from China. Buyers in China are treating domain names like an asset, which I have always thought made a lot of sense. I think as time goes on we’ll see increased buying activity from all over the world as people start to realize that domain names offer some of the same opportunities (or better) than we’ve seen with the stock market and real estate. With this shift also comes new sources of data, new blogs, and more places to follow the ever-changing market activity. For me Domaining.com continues to be a daily go-to resource and a lot of the blogs on here do a great job of keeping everyone in the know. I also look at marketplaces like 4.cn where a majority of the buyers are in China. That being said, I know there are a ton of other sites up there and I haven’t done a great job of keeping up with all of them. Which brings me to the title of this post. My question to you is – where do you go to keep up with what’s happening in the Chinese domain market?

Robert Lighthizer ( REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Reuters ) \"Fake news\" is now part of the American vernacular, and wordsmiths have Donald Trump to thank. President Trump recently handed out the 2017 \"Fake News Awards\" for the 11 most irresponsible examples of reporting. And the headlines, ranging from ice cream to pecan pie, bordered on—if not crossed—the ridiculous. Trump's \"favorite\" media outlet, CNN, garnered four of the awards. But long before last week's awards, Donald Trump was calling out those who just plain didn't get the story straight, even on the campaign trail. And his boldness resonated with voters, says Stephen E. Strang, author of the best-selling book, God and Donald Trump. Strang, who was a guest on Fox & Friends this past Sunday, said that when then-candidate Trump began responding to his critics at all hours of the day and night on Twitter, he surprised and embarrassed a lot of his detractors, tweeting strongly worded comments no one had expected. \"He had already waged highly publicized verbal battles with Meryl Streep and other celebrities such as Rosie O'Donnell and Oprah Winfrey, but this would be an altogether different kind of war,\" Strang wrote. \"With a level of technical savvy uncommon for a man of his generation, Trump was able to counterattack within minutes whenever his opponents made scurrilous charges against him. This was something new, and it delighted his fans and the public at large, even as it infuriated the increasingly volatile resistance. \"Before long, Trump was a serial tweeter, and he provided the media with some riveting sound bites,\" he continued. \"Not everyone, of course, was thrilled by this new development. Liberal news organizations compiled exhaustive catalogs of Trump's tweets to show how insensitive, ignorant and wrong-headed he could be. But they couldn't ignore them, and they followed his tweets faithfully, hoping to catch him in some word or deed that would be his undoing.\" advertisement Strang fully acknowledges that some of Trump's comments were tactless and crude, often attacking his detractors with salty schoolyard taunts. \"But Trump's use of Twitter gave him a way around the mainstream media and his political opponents who had been getting free access to the media and were able to insult and demean him with impunity,\" Strang wrote. \"Suddenly, those same people were being held accountable in real time, and news hawks on both sides didn't want to miss a word of it. \"Trump hasn't slowed his Twitter storm since moving into the White House,\" the author added. \"At one point, he had said there would have been 'ZERO chance of winning WH' if he had relied on the 'Fake News' being churned out by the mainstream media. But his candid and unfiltered Twitter feeds helped turn the tables on his foes.\" Strang is an award-winning journalist and successful businessman who began his career as a newspaper reporter at the Orlando Sentinel. He later founded a Christian publishing house and media company while interviewing and writing about nearly every Christian leader in the country over the past four decades.

Greg has over three decades of market research and trading experience, specializing in metals and commodity markets and even authored a book in 2006 titled Gold Trading Bootcamp, where he accurately predicted the implosion of the U.S. credit market and urged people to buy gold when it was only $550 an ounce. He is a highly sought-after presenter at financial conferences throughout the country, and is a regular guest on financial shows throughout the world, and it’s good to have him back here on the Money Metals Podcast. Greg, thanks for joining us today. And it’s nice to talk to you again. How are you? Greg Weldon: I’m great, thanks. My pleasure, Micheal. Mike Gleason: Well, when we had you on back in mid-August you were optimistic about gold at the time. We had a pretty good move higher, shortly thereafter that ended up with gold hitting a one year high. But it stalled out around $1,350 in early September and we’re currently back below $1,300 as we’re talking here on Wednesday afternoon. Gold hit resistance at about the same level in the summer of last year, so give us your update as to your current outlook. What drivers, if any, do you see that can push gold through that $1,350 resistance level in the months ahead, Greg? Greg Weldon: Yeah, well, exactly as you said. You had the move that we were anticipating when we last spoke and it kind of had already started from the 1205-ish level. All of this fitting into the kind of bigger picture, technical structure that still leads to a bullish resolution. But as you accurately mentioned, you got up to what have been close to, not quite even towards last summer’s highs around $1,375, $1,377. In this case, around $1,360 and ran out of steam. The dollar kind of changed some of the picture and the thought process linked to the Fed changed some of the picture. So, you embarked on a downside correction. $1,260 was the low, you have a nice little correction from that level. That was the level that equated to 200-day exponential moving average. It’s a level that was just below the 38% Fibonnaci retracement of the move up from $1,205. Actually, the move up from $1,123 back at the end of 2016. So you had real, critical support there. So, to me, everything’s kind of mapped out the way you might expect it to, structurally, in this market. From here, one of two things happens, I think. Well, one of three things, anyway. You could be cut if you have a bit of low rally backed up to $1,300. You back below it a little bit to dollars; still looks kind of strong. It’s an interest rate differential dynamic as a more hawkish view for the Fed is priced into the Fed funds; that gets transferred into the two-year and five-year treasury notes. The two-year treasury notes at a record high-yield relative to the German two-year schatzi. So, that lifting the dollar … it’s kind of gravitational pull to the upside. And that is some of the downside risk", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

She said that all these women are mind controlled and abused. Our insider states, many celeb charity boards are fronts for prostitution, sex trafficking and drugs. Many celebs are set up with boyfriends and marriages that are arranged. The actresses agree to do porn in exchange for all the perks of being with a rich man but knowing they will lose it all if they break up with the guy. HUMAN SACRIFICE Snuff films are just human sacrifices. These films are done when a sex slave/prostitute/call boy, has gotten slightly haggard and past their “sell by” date or has pissed off the wrong people. There is a huge market for these satanic sacrifice films among the exclusive, connected and wealthy circles i.e. the demonic Illuminati. She also touches on the pregnant actresses who are suddenly not pregnant. Their babies are used for human sacrifice. She claims Bristol Palin has been pregnant four times and three of the babies disappeared. She was suddenly not pregnant. You can read more about this here. Our actress believes there is a long list of famous people who have sacrificed a child, including many political figures. Many mysterious accidents have happened to big name people and thereafter, magically, their career takes off. Now I know where the saying comes from, whereby in signing a contract, people joke about giving up their first born child! For example, George Bush Sr., had two little girls that died. Ever heard of them? Remember Barbara Bush keeping a fetus in a jar? I can attest to this phenomenon and, I am very suspicious. Shortly after my beautiful young mother was killed in a horrific “accident”, weeks after the death, I was invited to Washington D.C. by a U.S. Senator. My father was his financial campaign manager. I went to the home of George Bush, Sr. for a party. Holding Poppy’s hand and chatting with Barbara, I remember being in total and complete shock and profoundly disassociated from my body at the time and for years afterward. Soon after this Presidential visit, my father’s career took off like gangbusters and we soon had oodles of money and a family jet. And who was flying in that jet? Henry Kissinger among many other elites. Pretty suspicious if you ask me. A Sacrifice? I don’t know. But, it makes me want to go hmm… mm…mm…Mammon? KANSAS NO MORE Our informant ran into the Dark Arts very early on. These dark arts are ruled by the Illuminati/reptilian/negative ET’s, negative humans/military industrial complex. The negative gatekeepers need a certain number of true artists, light worker types as camouflage. Sometimes these light types are targeted to move to a higher level on the playing field. At the same time they are surrounded by relatively nice “handlers” who don’t corrupt them. But, the conclusion is that at some point everyone in the industry has to make the decision to yield to the corruption or get out. That is, if it’s not too late. We are human batteries to them.

In the spirit of “Service Above Self”, here’s a quick review so you don’t have to suffer on your own. Cover articles “Obama Fights Back” interview and the Matt Taibbi article “The Truth About the Tea Party” are the most relevant. The Oval Office interview, by Jann Wenner appears highly scripted. No doubt pre-submitted questions and if not a pre-printed reply, then Wenner must have missed the teleprompter hanging behind his back. The Chief Executive did mention ‘We’ several times by necessity, but quickly reverted to the “I did everything” position of a true narcissist. The standard talking points were that tea party rubes are under unwitting control of Dick Armey and Freedom Works. Tea Party members are ‘anti-immigrant’ and ‘opposed by what I represent as president’ [they’re RACIST] and opposed to green energy and work place safety regulations. Obama continues, ‘Look, as president, I swore to uphold the Constitution, and part of that Constitution is a free press’, although the Fox News viewpoint is ‘destructive for the country’. Rather than admit ‘truth’ has a bearing on media success, viewpoints are just a marketing tool. Meanwhile our fearless leader ‘had to prevent a Great Depression, restore the financial system, manage two wars’…liberate health care from doctors and student loans and health insurance from the private sector. He’s achieved 70% of his goals in 40% of his first term and public option, additional taxes and greater control of everything is enabled and awaiting regulatory enforcement. Another Barack goal was a White House basketball goal, now erected on the existing tennis court. A half page photo shows our leader shooting hoops with the Washington Monument in the background. While not busy slam dunking domestic issues this savant has ‘reset our relations with Russia’, brought peace to the Middle East, ended the Iraq war and restored America’s leadership on issues like human rights and torture world-wide. He can do all this while listening to the 2000 songs he has loaded into his iPod. Mr Pres agrees with NASA wack-job James Hanson, that climate change is comparable to slavery faced by Lincoln and Nazism faced by Churchill. His nut-case Energy Secretary, Steven Chu has claimed painting all roofs and highways white would provide a temporary solution to global warming. Surprising, Chu was the ‘unsung hero of the Gulf Oil spill…this guy went down and helped design the way to plug that hole with BP engineers’. Finally credit for everything is given to this administration. The subject of command performances came up with Bob Dylan skipping all of the expected idolatry, singing “The Times They Are A Changing”, dissing the photo-ops and leaving. The opposite occurred at the Sir Paul McCartney concert. Discussing this Beatle singing ‘Michelle’ to Barack’s Michelle sends a sobbing president from the room. The Matt Taibbi article “Tea & Crackers” had some surprising areas of agreement. “This is America and we have an entrenched oligarchical system in place that insulates us from the any meaningful political change”. Matt goes on to detail the compromising of Tea Party issues and candidates by the GOP insiders, a very real problem for all true patriots. Matt mentions Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul and possible emerging conflicts and then mentions Rand’s dad, Rep Ron Paul and", "_diversity_score": 9.461294703485741}

Geopolitical tensions have been rising dramatically over the last few years, with religious extremism, oil, petro-dollar, historical rivalries and nationalism driving the world towards conflict. These extreme economic and geopolitical stresses are coinciding along the same timeline and will erupt simultaneously, catalyzing the climactic half of this Fourth Turning. “The risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule. If there is a war, it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort – in other words, a total war. Every Fourth Turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction, and in mankind’s willingness to use it.” – Strauss & Howe – The Fourth Turning With the House of Saud descending into madness as religious zealots, kings, princes, and foreign infiltrators vie for control of their depleting oil riches, and tens of billions in high tech weaponry provided by American arms dealers, a Middle East conflagration is a certainty. Iran has been winning the proxy wars in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Saudi Arabia and Israel are determined to stop Iran’s expansion at any cost. Mixing religious extremism, oil riches, gas pipelines, opium, egotistical dictators, nuclear bombs, hatred and territorial ambitions into the deepening militaristic global mood change is destined to spark a chain reaction of unintended consequences and unyielding responses. The next Middle East war will not be a proxy war. It will be a fight to the death. You need a scorecard to figure out the alliances, opponents and wildcards. Iran appears to be aligned with Iraq, Qatar, Syria, Hezbollah, Yemen, and Russia. Saudi Arabia appears to be aligned with Israel, UAE, and the United States. Various factions, who include Turkey, ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Kurds, are fighting one or more of these parties. In many cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend applies. Peace and compromise are out of the question at this point. It’s just a matter of who pulls the trigger to kick off the fireworks. It looks like Saudi Arabia is willing to gamble everything on a final showdown with Iran. Once the shooting starts and the U.S. and Russia are sucked in, all bets are off on what happens next. Diplomacy will not be an option. This scenario presumes a Korean conflict doesn’t happen first. With reckless actions on the part of Kim Jung Un and reckless rhetoric from both sides, the odds of a Korean conflict are the highest since the 1950s. With three carrier groups sitting off the Korean coastline, just one provocative act or mistake could unleash a fusillade from both sides, killing hundreds of thousands in a matter of days. Global treaties, alliances and economic realities are pushing global powers in unforeseen directions, just as this Fourth Turning enters its most dangerous phase. Human failings are the constant throughout history. But, human failings resulted in 50,000 deaths during the American Revolution Crisis. They could result in hundreds of millions of deaths during this Crisis. The U.S. and Europe’s provocative actions with NATO forces surrounding Russia, the ongoing Ukraine civil war, the Syrian civil war, and false accusations of rigging the U.S. presidential election have pushed Russia into a closer alliance with China.

Candidate Donald Trump highlighted the crime victims of illegal aliens, including giving them a platform at the Republican convention. In his acceptance speech for the presidency at the convention he said: On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system. Here are the parents Trump mentioned, Jamiel Shaw Sr., Mary Ann Mendoza and Sabine Durden, with pictures of their lost sons below: President Donald Trump is working to build the wall and keep out dangerous foreigners to protect the American people.

A recent report led by theand the Center for Public Integrity, has revealed that the manufacturers of opioid drugs, such as OxyContin, Vicodin and fentanyl, spent a whopping $880 million on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts. This huge amount of money was spent pushing against state efforts to restrict the amount of prescription opioid drugs floating around.For the unaware, the United States is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic – one that has been particularly profitable for Big Pharma. OxyContin has been one of the most prolific drugs in the prescription opioid craze, and one of the most addictive.writes that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that Purdue Pharma knowingly lied about their product. Despite being marketed as a 12-hour pill, the' handiwork revealed that Purdue \"knew the claim was a lie, as did its sales reps, patients, medical professional and even regulatory authorities. At best, Oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief ...\"This means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms, received inadequate care, and were often pushed up to a higher dose of OxyContin – which puts patients at increased risk of death. However, higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses, so this was a very clever, and malevolent , marketing choice by Purdue.You can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public well-being, and quite a lot about profits. It is not surprising that Purdue Pharma, and others like them, have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the American people. Between 2006 and 2015, Big Pharma spent nearly 200 times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period. Sadly, it is not just Big Pharma pushing their agenda. Even organizations that many people consider to be \"respectable,\" have dipped their toes in the pond. The American Cancer Society, for example, has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry.Opioids are very similar to heroin, only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers. Due to their highly addictive nature, it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything; opioids are a cash cow.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform, told the: \"They are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing.\" And while they benefit, millions suffer.Over 2 million Americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs. Just shy of a half-million people suffer with heroin addiction, as well. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that roughly 80 percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs . Being that prescription opioids are rather expensive, it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options. This figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs, but many others as well. One could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids, in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly. Some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to 60 deaths each day Spending $880 million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Originally published at blog.NORML.org Those of us who support the full legalization of marijuana are greatly benefiting from political reforms adopted during what is frequently referred to as the Progressive Era in this country. The principal objective of the progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government, and to accomplish that goal, proponents sought ways to take down the powerful and corrupt political bosses and to provide access by ordinary Americans to the political system – a concept called direct democracy, as contrasted to representative democracy. It was during this period that the concept of direct primaries to nominate candidates for public office, direct election of U.S. senators, and universal suffrage for women gained traction. And, most important to our work, the procedures known as referendum and initiatives began to be adopted in several states. In 1902, Oregon was the first state to adopt the option of initiative and referendum to change public policy, permitting citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or constitutional amendments. This process was called an initiative if the change originated by action of citizens, without the involvement of the legislature, and as a referendum if it originated from the legislature but was referred to the voters to decide. By 1920, a total of 22 states had adopted provisions modeled on the Oregon system. Today, a total of 24 states offer a voter initiative. In the rest of the states, the only avenue to change public policy is through the state legislature. This brief history of direct democracy is relevant today because it is this access to direct political action by voters that has allowed marijuana legalization to move forward, years earlier than would have been politically possible through the action of state legislatures. The four states and the District of Columbia that have approved full legalization for all adults, and the five states that will be voting on full legalization in November, all rely on voter initiatives. These progressive procedures have worked precisely as they were intended back in the Progressive Era: They have allowed citizens to go around the establishment to alter the status quo. Voter initiatives are unpopular among most elected officials. Altering the status quo has not taken place without some legal kicking and screaming by the elected officials in those states. It comes as no surprise that most elected officials do not appreciate the fact that public policies in their states can, when necessary, be changed without their consent. As we approach the end of summer and the coming fall elections, we once again see examples of the extraordinary time and resources many establishment politicians and other anti-marijuana zealots are willing to invest to try to prevent citizens in their states from voting directly on marijuana policy. The reason, of course, is obvious. According to recent national polls, a clear majority of the American public (between 55 and 61 percent) supports an end to marijuana prohibition. If given the opportunity to vote on the issue, they will vote to legalize marijuana. Elected officials, who otherwise claim to represent the will of the voters in their states, and other self-appointed moral guardians, go to great lengths to try to stop the votes from happening. Democracy is something they support so long as the public favors the same policies they favor. When the public gets out ahead of the establishment, democracy be damned; they will use any tools available, including procedural and constitutional challenges, to avoid allowing the voters to decide the issue. Full legalization proposals. We will have full legalization", "_diversity_score": 2.3725735043705303}

Thirty minutes into that game, and three miles away from the stadium, workers at the oil refinery owned by Philadelphia Energy Solutions had been informed that their jobs were in jeopardy.

Those jobs were secure for years — the refinery was the largest oil refining complex on the East Coast. Where can the soon-to-be unemployed direct their anger? Farmers in flyover country and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. The refinery is going broke, Reuters reports, largely because of the government. Since 2012, Philadelphia Energy Solutions has spent $800 million to comply with the Renewable Fuels Standard, which forces refiners to blend a certain amount of biofuels into the fuel supply or to purchase credits. Complying with this regulation was the refiner’s second-biggest cost after purchasing the actual crude oil to refine. The Eagles will head to the Super Bowl the first Sunday of February.

That’s $60 million too much. UNRWA has become the poster child for U.N. bureaucratic bloat, mission creep, and twisted morality. UNRWA was founded in 1949 to help Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel’s war of independence. Even that decision was questionable. After all, putting Israel’s creation aside, in the 1940s alone, wars created more than 40 million refugees. There was World War II, of course, but the 1947 partition of India also displaced 14 million persons and created millions of refugees. In the wake of Israel’s creation, Arab states expelled hundreds of thousands of their Jews. This is why the U.N. created the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to be the permanent agency charged with refugee assistance and protection. Individual Palestinian Arab families suffered dislocation and tragedy, but they were hardly alone. They were alone, however, in having a U.N. agency created to cater specifically to them. Still, when the U.N. created UNRWA, it was meant to be a temporary agency to address a temporary problem. Once it resettled Palestinian refugees, its job was done and it was to shut its doors forever and dissolve. In a 1951 report to the UN General Assembly, UNRWA reported, “There must be a firm goal of terminating relief operations. Sustained relief operations inevitably contain the germ of human deterioration.” It was right, but Arab state rejectionism got in the way. Arab states like Egypt, Syria, and Iraq quickly concluded that they could use UNRWA to perpetuate the problem, to undercut normalization with Israel, and to transform an aid agency into a weapon against Israel. The rest is history. Both current UNRWA Commissioner General Pierre Krahenbuhl and UNRWA spokesman Chris Gunness were born years after UNRWA was meant to dissolve. Nor does UNRWA’s track record make it worth saving. While UNHCR has resettled refugees and allowed them to get on with their lives, UNRWA has actively undercut settlement. It has embraced a unique definition of refugee that differs with UNHCR and that is used everywhere else in the world. Consider: If India and Pakistan used the same definition of refugee from their partition that UNRWA embraces, there would be more than 100 million refugees in South Asia today. UNRWA has helped make the Palestinians the largest per capita recipient of aid on earth, but has the least to show for it. The problem isn’t just waste of money, however. Almost a quarter-century after the Palestinian Authority began, UNRWA has eroded rather than supported the foundations of good governance. After all, if UNRWA promises to take care of housing, education, and support, why shouldn’t both the Palestinian Authority and their sometime-partner Hamas spend money on terror pensions, terror tunnels, and an arsenal of rockets? Add into the mix UNRWA incompetence: schools used as arsenals, school books teaching incitement, UNRWA employees moonlighting as bomb makers, and terror recruitment in UNRWA high schools and the problem is even worse. UNRWA denials of complicity in such activities, if taken at face value, are just acknowledgment of its own poor oversight. It’s long past time", "_diversity_score": 7.7150239940937615}

UNRWA has become a cancer not only for those who seek peace and reconciliation, but also for the entire UN system. UNRWA in 1951 was right. Permanence is not a virtue; it’s an impediment.

A plan to establish two new military headquarters designed to improve the movement of troops across the Atlantic and within Europe to counter Russia was endorsed at the November 8-9 meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. One of the planned new NATO command centers will be tasked with ensuring the security of \"sea lines of communication\" between North America and Europe. The other command will \"improve the movement of military forces across Europe\" and strengthen logistical functions across NATO. Military commanders would \"flesh out the details\" and present them to defense ministers in February 2018. \"This is not only about commands,\" said Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. According to him, it is vital that European roads, bridges and rail networks are able to carry tanks and heavy military equipment. \"We are now much more focused on moving heavy equipment across Europe,\" he explained. The locations are due to be chosen next year. Germany has expressed interest in hosting the logistics base. Portugal, Spain, France, and the United States could be potential hosts for the new Atlantic command. The ministers also agreed on the creation of a new Cyberoperations Center to strengthen cyberdefenses and help integrate cybercapabilities into NATO planning and operations at all levels. NATO nations deployed about 4,000 troops this year across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Poland – the alliance members which share borders with Russia. The NATO event coincided in time with the United States House and Senate Armed Services Committees’ approval (Nov.8) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018. The NDAA supports a topline of $692 billion for national defense—a $26 billion increase above the President’s combined initial and amended budget requests. The NDAA also authorizes $4.6 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) to boost military capability to counter Russia, including accelerating procurement of Army prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe. The bill limits military-to-military cooperation with Moscow. The legislation authorizes $350 million to provide security assistance to Ukraine, including defensive lethal weapons. $100 million will be spent on military aid to the Baltic States. The bill includes the allocation of $58 million to counter Russia’s alleged non-compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, including a research and development program on a ground-launched intermediate-range missile, “which would not place the United States in violation of the treaty.” Section 1635 of NDAA allows the Pentagon to establish “a research and development program for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-launched missile system with a maximum range of 5,500 kilometers.” This is the first step to jettison the treaty. True, the development of a ground-based mid-range missile is not yet a violation but rather a demonstration of intent to do so. But once allocated, money cannot be wasted. The deployment of NATO ground-based nuclear-tipped intermediate forces in the Old Continent is a European problem as NATO allies will become targets for Russia’s retaliatory strikes. Then why should the US tackle it if Europeans don’t ask it to do so? After all, the pretext for development of the missile is the need to defend European allies but no European NATO member has asked the US for protection. Why should the US take the initiative into its hands without European nuclear powers, such as the UK and France, participating", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

After all, the pretext for development of the missile is the need to defend European allies but no European NATO member has asked the US for protection. Why should the US take the initiative into its hands without European nuclear powers, such as the UK and France, participating in the program? Perhaps, the situation when Europeans fully depend on the US to protect them from “Russia’s nuclear threat” serves the American interests boosting Washington’s influence over European affairs. With the INF Treaty effective no more, Moscow will be free to deploy intermediate-range missiles without restriction. No European NATO member has given consent to have the weapons on its territory. The decision to develop a ground-based mid-range missile may spark a backlash from European allies. The deployment of US intermediate-range weapons on the Old Continent will hit them in the same way the extension of American sanctions on European energy companies runs counter to their economic interests. The fact that the NDAA authorizes the development of the weapon banned by the treaty will inevitably impact Russia’s military planning. True, Russia and the US have problems with the INF Treaty. Each side accuses the other of non-compliance at the time the general state of the bilateral relations hinders the attempts to find common language on any issue. Expanding the European Deterrence Initiative is also not the best way to ease tensions with Russia. Despite that, opportunities offered by the Special Verification Commission (SVC) envisioned by the INF Treaty are far from being exhausted. The parties could use the SVC venue to consider additional confidence-building measures and information exchanges. Contemporary technical means of verification make violations impossible to conceal. Evidence can be presented and differences can be ironed out. But, if signed by President as it is, the NDAA will include first practical steps to tear up the INF Treaty. The violation of the treaty will negatively affect the prospects for strategic offensive forces (SOF) control. The INF and New START are the only two remaining nuclear arms control treaties in force. The capability of the US to knock out elements of command and control structure as well as at least some ground-based Russian strategic nuclear assets from Europe without using its intercontinental capability will influence the balance of SOF. One thing will lead to another eroding the entire nuclear arms control regime. Looks like the views of Heritage Foundation calling for withdrawal from the treaty prevail in the US Congress. The NATO defense chiefs and US lawmakers have just taken new steps on the way to making the probability of war an uncomfortably real prospect.", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

Could American democracy be replaced with totalitarian rule? There's enough resemblance that Yale historian Timothy Snyder, who studies fascist and communist regime change and totalitarian rule, has written a book warning about the threat and offering lessons for resistance and survival. The author of On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century talked to AlterNet's Steven Rosenfeld. Steven Rosenfeld: Three weeks ago, you said that the country has perhaps a year 'to defend American democracy.' You said what happens in the next few weeks is crucial. Are you more concerned than ever that our political culture and institutions are evolving toward fascism, resembling key aspects of the early 20th-century European regimes you’ve studied? Timothy Snyder: Let me answer you in three parts. The first thing is that the 20 lessons that I wrote, I wrote on November 15th. The book, On Tyranny, was done by Christmas. Which means if people read it now, and people are reading it, and it's describing the world they are in, that means I’ve successfully made predictions based on history. We’re going to talk about what is going to come, but I want to point out that timeline—it was basically completely blind. But the book does describe what is going on now. The year figure is there because we have to recognize that things move fast. Nazi Germany took about a year. Hungary took about two and a half years. Poland got rid of the top-level judiciary within a year. It’s a rough historical guess, but the point is because there is an outside limit, you therefore have to act now. You have to get started early. It’s just very practical advice. It’s the meta-advice of the past: That things slip out of reach for you, psychologically very quickly, and then legally almost as quickly. It’s hard for people to act when they feel other people won’t act. It’s hard for people to act when they feel like they have to break the law to do so. So it is important to get out in front before people face those psychological and legal barriers. Am I more worried now? I realize that was your question. No, I’m exactly as worried as I was before, in November. I think that the people who inhabit the White House inhabit a different ideological world in which they would like for the United States not to be the constitutional system that it now is. I was concerned about that in November. I’m concerned about it now. Nothing that has happened since has changed the way I see things. SR: Let’s talk about how this evolution takes place. You’ve written about how 'post-truth is pre-fascism.' You talk about leaders ignoring facts, law and history. How far along this progression are we? I’m wondering where you might see things going next. TS: That’s tough because what history does is give you a whole bunch of cases where democratic republics become authoritarian regimes; sometimes fascist regimes, sometimes communist regimes. It doesn’t give you one storyline: A, B, C, D. It gives you a bunch of clusters of A, and a bunch of clusters of C.

It doesn’t give you one storyline: A, B, C, D. It gives you a bunch of clusters of A, and a bunch of clusters of C. But factuality is really important and more important than people realize, because it’s the substructure of regime change. We think about democracy, and that’s the word that Americans love to use, democracy, and that’s how we characterize our system. But if democracy just means going to vote, it’s pretty meaningless. Russia has democracy in that sense. Most authoritarian regimes have democracy in that sense. Nazi Germany had democracy in that sense, even after the system had fundamentally changed. Democracy only has substance if there’s the rule of law. That is, if people believe that the votes are going to be counted and they are counted. If they believe that there’s a judiciary out there that will make sense of things if there’s some challenge. If there isn’t rule of law, people will be afraid to vote the way they want to vote. They'll vote for their own safety as opposed to their convictions. So the thing we call democracy depends on the rule of law. And the things we call the rule of law depends upon trust. Law functions 99 percent of the time automatically. It functions because we think it’s out there. And that, in turn, depends on the sense of truth. So there’s a mechanism here. You can get right to heart of the matter if you can convince people that there is no truth. Which is why the stuff that we characterize as post-modern and might dismiss is actually really, really essential. The second thing about 'post-truth is pre-fascism' is I’m trying to get people’s attention, because that is actually how fascism works. Fascism says, disregard the evidence of your senses, disregard observation, embolden deeds that can’t be proven, don’t have faith in god but have faith in leaders, take part in collective myth of an organic national unity, and so forth. Fascism was precisely about setting the whole Enlightenment aside and then selling what sort of myths emerged. Now those [national] myths are pretty unpredictable, and contingent on different nations and different leaders and so on, but to just set facts aside is actually the fastest catalyst. So that part concerns me a lot. Where we’re going? The classic thing to watch out for is the shift from one governing strategy to another. In the U.S. system, the typical governing strategy is you more or less have to follow your constituents with legislation because of the election cycle. That’s one pulse of politics. The other pulse of politics is emergency. There’s some kind of terrorist attack and then the leader tries to suspend basic constitutional rights. And then we get on a different rhythm, where the rhythm is not one electoral cycle to the next but one emergency to the next. That’s how regime changes take place. It’s a classic way since the Reichstag fire [when the Nazis burned their nation’s capitol building and blamed communist arsonists].

It’s a classic way since the Reichstag fire [when the Nazis burned their nation’s capitol building and blamed communist arsonists]. So in terms of what might happen next, or what people could look out for, some kind of event that the government claims is a terrorist incident, would be something to be prepared for. That’s why it’s one of the lessons in the book. SR: You have talked before about that kind of emergency justification—and even with Vladimir Putin in Russia. Is that what you think would happen here? Because with the exception of the judiciary, a lot of American institutions, like Congress, are not really resisting. They’re going along. TS: They’re going along… but my own intuition would be the emergency situation arises because going along isn’t going to be enough. Paradoxically, Congress is going along and is going to pass a bunch of stuff, which is not actually very popular. Right? It’s not going to be so popular to have millions of people lose health insurance, which is what’s going to happen. The ironic things about the Republican Congress is now it has the ability to do everything it wants to do, but none of what it wants to do is that popular. Except with the few big lobbies, of course. The freedom the Republicans have is the freedom to impose their agenda on down. The same thing goes with Mr. Trump. The things that he might do that some people would like, like building a wall or driving all the immigrants out, those things are going to be difficult or slow. In the case of the wall, I personally don’t believe it will ever happen. It’s going to be very slow. So my suspicion is that it is much easier to have a dramatic negative event, than have a dramatic positive event. That is one of the reasons I am concerned about the Reichstag fire scenario. The other reason is that we are being mentally prepared for it by all the talk about terrorism and by the Muslim ban. Very often when leaders repeat things over and over they are preparing you for when that meme actually emerges in reality. SR: I want to change the topic slightly. You cite many examples from Germany in 1933, the year Hitler consolidated power. So what did ordinary Germans miss that’s relevant for ordinary Americans now? I know some of this is the blurring of facts. But when I have talked to Holocaust survivors, they often say, nobody ever thought things would be that bad, or nobody thought the Germans would go as far as they did. TS: The German Jews then, and people now, don’t understand how quick their neighbors will change; don’t understand how quickly society can change. They don’t understand the fact that a life that’s been predictable for a long time, doesn’t mean that it will be predictable tomorrow. And people like to think that their experience is exceptional.

German Jews might have thought, 'Well, there were pogroms [ethnic cleansing] in Russia, but surely nothing like that could happen here.' That’s what many German Jews thought. So one issue is people need to realize how quickly things can change. The second thing that German Jews were not aware of, or Germans were not aware of, was how new media can quickly change conversations. In that way, it’s not exactly the same, but radio at that time often ended up being a channel for propaganda. There are parallels with the internet now, where there were hopes that it would be [primarily] enlightening. But in fact, it turns out that with presidential tweets, or with bots, or isolated habits of viewing, it isn’t necessarily enlightening. It’s the opposite. A lot of us were blindsided by the internet in much the same way that people could be blindsided by radio in the 1930s. But here’s the other view. The one that we have that German Jews didn’t have in 1933 is we have their experience. That’s the premise of the whole book; the premise is that the 20th century showed us what can happen, and there’s lots of wonderful scholarship by German historians and others, which breaks down what can happen and how. And so, one of the first things that we should be doing is taking advantage of the one opportunity that we really have that they didn’t, which is to learn from that history. And that’s the premise of the book. SR: All of your book’s lessons are very personal: Don’t obey in advance. Believe in truth. Stand out. Defend institutions. Be calm but as courageous as you can be. Yet the change or oppression that you are talking about is systemic and institutional. What do you say to people who say, 'I’ll try, but I may not have the power here.' There’s that cliche, tilting at windmills. ... TS: Well, if everyone tilted against a windmill, the windmill would fall down, right? Party of the tragedy of Don Quixote is he’s tilting against the wrong thing. So that’s not our problem. We’re pretty sure what the problem is. But he was also alone except for his faithful companion. We’re not really alone. There are millions and millions of people who are looking for that thing to do. Just by sheer math, if everyone does a little thing, it will make a difference. And much of what I am recommending is—you’re right, they are things that people can do, but they also involve some kind of engagement. Whether it’s the small talk [with those you disagree with] or whether it’s the corporeal politics. And that little bit of engagement helps you realize that what you are doing has a kind of sense, even if it doesn’t immediately change the order.

There are times, and this is one of those times, where small gestures, or their absence, can make a huge difference. So the things that might not have mattered a year ago do matter now. The basic thing is we are making a difference whether we realize it or not, and the basic question is whether it is positive or negative. Let me put it a different way. Except for really dramatic moments, most of the time authoritarianism depends on some kind of cycle involving a popular consent of some form. It really does matter how we behave. The danger is [if] we say, 'Well, we don’t see how it matters, and so therefore we are going to just table the whole question.' If we do that, then we start to slide along and start doing the things that the authorities expect of us. Which is why lesson number one is: Don’t obey in advance. You have to set the table differently. You have to say, 'This is a situation in which I need to think for myself about all of the things that I am going to do and not just punt. Not just wait. Nor just see how things seems to me. Because if you do that, then you change and you actually become part of the regime change toward authoritarianism.' SR: You cite in the book something I read in high school: Eugene Ionesco’s existential play about fascism, Rhinoceros, where people talk about their colleagues at work, in academia, saying stuff like, 'Come on, I don’t agree with everything, but give him a chance.' Ionesco’s point is that people join an unthinking herd before they know it. What would you suggest people do, when they run into others who fall on this spectrum? TS: There are a few questions here. One is how to keep yourself going. Another is how to energize other people who agree with you. And the third thing is not quite Rhinoceros stuff, but how to catch people who are slipping. Like that CNN coverage last week of the speech to Congress, where one of the CNN commentators said, 'Oh, now this is presidential.' That was a Rhinoceros moment, because there was nothing presidential—it was atrocious to parade the victims of crimes committed by one ethnicity. That was atrocious and there’s nothing presidential about it. Catching Rhinoceros moments is one thing. I think it’s really important to think about. The example that Ionesco gives is people saying, 'Yeah, on one hand, with the Jews, maybe they are right.' With Trump, people will say something like, 'Yeah, but on taxes, maybe he’s right.' And the thing to catch is, 'Yeah", "_diversity_score": 14.833215046132008}

With people all the way over at the end of the spectrum who are now confident about Trump—that’s a different subject. I think it’s important to maintain impossible human relations across that divide, because some of those people are going to change their minds. It’s harsh. But some will change their minds, and if they have no one to talk to, it will be much harder for them to change their minds. At different points on the spectrum, you have to think in different ways. My own major concern right now is with self-confidence and the energy of the people who do have the deep—and, I think incorrect—conviction that something has gone wildly wrong. SR: The people who have the conviction that something has gone wildly wrong—that can describe Trump supporters and Trump opponents. TS: That’s a good point. So much of this is personal. In the book, I don’t actually mention anybody’s name, except the thinkers who I admire. So much of this is personal that people think, 'Well, if you say anything critical, it is about you as a person, and how you don’t like anything about someone who likes Trump.' That’s a way for there to be no political discussion. I think it’s useful, even though you will never win the argument, when you are talking about people who support to the administration, to stay at the level of the Constitution. To stay at the level of freedom, or stay at the level of basic issues, like, is global warming really going to be so great, when the entire Pentagon says that it is a national security threat? Or, is it really such a good idea to treat Muslims like this? Or, is it really going to be so good when millions of people lose health insurance? Keep it at the level of issues as much as possible, because what I’ve found is the pattern that people shift to is, 'Why are you going to be so hard on this guy? Give him a chance.' But the issues of what’s constitutional, what is actually American, and what’s going to be a policy that they are going to be proud of a year from now—keep the conversation closest to the Constitution. It’s easiest to be dismissed when it’s personal. And fundamentally, this is the trick. It isn’t personal. It doesn’t matter who’s in charge. What matters is the system, which people of very different convictions take for granted, is now under threat.

But out here in California, it also feels like the deportation machinery is getting ready for undocumented immigrants. On Monday, Reuters reported that Homeland Security officials said they might separate mothers from kids when making arrests. Germany did that as it rounded up Jews. Don’t they face just as grave a threat? TS: With the Muslims, the resemblance to anti-Semitic policy in Germany in ’33 is that if you can pick some group and make them stand in for some international threat, then you can change domestic politics, because domestic politics then is no longer about compromises and competing interests, domestic politics is about who inside the society should actually be seen and outside the society. Once you get the wedge in with the first group, them you essentially win. It could be the Muslims. It could be somebody else, is the point. The political logic is basically the same. With undocumented immigrants, I think the logic might be a little bit different. I think the goal might be to get us used to seeing a certain kind of police power. And getting us used to seeing things happening to people in public. And then if we get used to that, then we might be more willing for the dial to turn a little bit further. It’s too soon for me to speculate confidently about all of this. I think you’re right though, it could be the Muslims, but it doesn’t have to be the Muslims. The crucial thing is to get some kind of in [political opening] where people go along with or accept stigmatization. And the logic is there’s always some kind of threat that comes from beyond the country. And that we can fix that threat on a group of people inside the country. And if you go along with this, what else are you agreeing to go along with? SR: To go back to your book, what you’re saying is that people should be vigilant, should know their values and participate at some level with making those values known, because that is what ordinary people can do. TS: Yes. The point of the book is [that] we are facing a real crisis and a real moment of choice. The possibilities are much darker than Americans are used to considering. But at the same time, what we can do is much more important than we realize. The regime will only change if the gamble of the people in the White House is right: That many of us despise many others of us and that most of us are indifferent. If it turns out that there are emotions and values that are more numerous and more vibrant than indifference and hatred, things are going to be okay. That depends on us. That depends on us making certain realizations. It depends on us acting fast. In that sense it’s a test, not just collectively. Maybe there’s no such thing as a collective test.

Comparisons between grocery stores and school choice are a fairly common comparison. If, for example, food stamp recipients were only allowed to use their benefits at the nearest grocery store, there would be outrage. Low-income families would be stuck shopping at low-quality convenience stores while the wealthy would be free to shop at the grocery stores of their choice. Kennedy's comparison wasn't too far out there, but it was funny nonetheless. Not everyone was amused by Kennedy's quip. \"Education is not mayonnaise, and the day we choose to treat public education like the marketing of our condiments we have given up on our kids,\" Sen.

Kennedy, apparently not one to mince words or spread them on slices of whole-grain bread, produced another giggle-worthy moment at the Senate subcommittee hearing when he asked Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, \"You're aware, I'm sure, that some people don't like you because you support vouchers and charter schools?\" DeVos took this answer in stride, replying with a grin, said, \"I'm peripherally aware of that, yes.\" Jason Russell is the contributors editor for the Washington Examiner.", "_diversity_score": 7.7150239940937615}

This is a move sure to be seen in Moscow as a drastic escalation that will almost certainly precipitate a Russian retaliation. Russian officials denounced President Trump’s authorization of lethal equipment to the Ukrainians as an aggressive act meant to deliberately sabotage the Minsk peace process. “The United States has crossed a line by announcing its intention to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Saturday. “U.S. weapons are capable of leading to new casualties in our neighboring country, and we cannot remain indifferent to that.” The decision was framed by the State Department as one of assisting Ukraine to fight back against Russian “aggression” and was lauded by Congressional war hawks as a necessary step to confront what many neocons and Cold War relics see as an expansionist Russian foreign policy. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the weapons were, “part of our effort to help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity, to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to deter further aggression.” Proponents of sending the Ukrainian government advanced US weapons believe that if they can exact a harsh enough death toll on Russian soldiers assisting separatists in the Donbas, it will force Putin to withdraw support for the separatists. The insane logic being employed by the West shows little understanding of the psychology of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is simply wishful thinking to believe that a war of attrition, on the border of Russia, will force Putin to retreat. Instead, it will precipitate a drastic escalation in Russian support. One need simply analyze the past few years of war in Eastern Ukraine to clearly see that Moscow is willing to take undertake whatever economic, political or military consequences are necessary to prevent the defeat of anti-Kiev separatists in the Donbas. In 2014 and 2015, when Ukrainian soldiers and pro-government neo-Nazi battalions were engaging Ukrainian separatists in fierce door-to-door, house-to-house fighting, Russia didn’t back down – instead, they escalated and forcefully stepped up support – as they supplied not only personnel, but tanks, supplies, and reinforcements to stop Kiev’s advances. According to Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington, D.C. thinktank: In Putin’s mind, allowing Ukraine to retake strategic territory was an unthinkable prospect that would lead Kiev to believe that it could squash the rebellion militarily. The infusion of Russian troops stopped Ukrainian territorial advances in their tracks, at considerable human cost to Kiev. In other words, whenever pro-Russian militants were losing ground or at risk, Moscow turned on the spigot of assistance to prevent a humiliating defeat or retreat. This is one of the biggest reminders to the world community that Ukraine’s political disposition is ultimately far more important to Russia’s strategic interests than it is to Washington’s. No amount of U.S. military equipment or heavy weapons systems is likely to eclipse what the Russians will provide to the other side. To believe Russia will be intimidated into withdrawing its troops from Ukrainian territory or suing for a peace with a government Moscow sees as a puppet of the West just", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

To believe Russia will be intimidated into withdrawing its troops from Ukrainian territory or suing for a peace with a government Moscow sees as a puppet of the West just because a few more of its soldiers have been killed is to place hope over the reality of Putin’s track record throughout the war. Whether we in the United States or Western Europe accept it as legitimate or not, Putin is highly motivated to preserve Russian influence and freedom of movement in a country that shares a 1,426-mile border with the Russian Federation. To allow Ukraine to drift fully into Europe’s orbit on his watch would be nothing short of a personal political humiliation for Putin and, more important, a geopolitical catastrophe for a Russia whose political elites remain incredibly nervous about a shrinking Near Abroad and any hint of political revolution in the former Soviet space. The decision to provide advanced lethal weaponry to Ukraine will be used by Moscow as an excuse to increase its support to Ukrainian proxies in the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The Russian government has operated in virtual lockstep with proxy forces since the Western coup to depose then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Although made to look like a spontaneous revolution of the people of Ukraine, further study in the wake of the Euromaidan revealed a plethora of oligarchic forces called Fatherland, neo-Nazi Ukrainian nationalists, and shadowy intelligence forces operating in concert with Western intelligence agencies to create a perfect storm for a “popular revolution” in Ukraine. What appeared on the face to be a popular uprising was, in reality, nothing more than a well-scripted coup attempt meant to install a pro-Western government in Ukraine. The Eastern regions of Ukraine, with large Russian speaking populations, refused to recognize this illegitimate government and requested federalization as to maintain a semblance of autonomy from the pro-Western regime that took power. However, the new pro-West government refused and instead sent in military forces to occupy the region. This precipitated local resistance and Russian assistance to the local Ukrainian forces fighting to defend their home from the newly installed regime in Kiev. President Trump’s choice to deepen U.S. engagement in a conflict that involves a non-NATO country and whose political positioning is largely irrelevant to U.S. policy in Europe is a bad decision that has frightening implications regarding the increased potential for conflict with another nuclear superpower. In an article for Breaking Defense , DePetris posited numerous, compelling, unanswered questions that reveal the extremely shortsighted nature of the Trump administration’s decision: What, for instance, is the U.S. objective in Ukraine other than simply trying to bleed the Russians in a proxy conflict? When — not if — Russia escalates, what would the Trump administration do to counter it? How far is the U.S. willing to go to frustrate Moscow’s ambitions in a country it sees as an extension of its former Soviet glory?

But more drivers leads to more accidents, which results in higher insurance rates for everyone. April's 6 percent jump was the biggest the nation has seen since 2003. \"Unfortunately, out on our roadways, we're seeing a collision course of all the factors that affect what we pay for car insurance,\" Carole Walker, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, told Legal Reader. The National Safety Council said 2015 was the deadliest year since 2008, with 38,300 deaths. The NSC reported that 4.4 million people were seriously injured. Nearly every state is feeling the burden and \"good\" drivers are not exempt from rate hikes, Walker said. Auto insurer Allstate recorded one of the biggest rate increases so far in Georgia, where prices went up by an average of 25 percent, while traffic fatalities in the state increased 21 percent. In recent years, insurance companies have experienced a decline in profits. From 2005-13, the average payout for bodily injury claims rose 32 percent, according to the Insurance Research Council. Avoiding moving violations and at-fault accidents are the most effective ways to lower costs, Walker said. Drivers also can ask insurance agents about other ways to save. \"Can I be a better driver? Can I take a defensive driving class? What kind of car do I drive? Is it more crash-worthy?\" Walker said. \"That will also offer you discounts on what you pay.\" — Joana Suleiman FOOD SAFETY GAO to FDA: Improve tool for assessing imported food risk After looking at the Food and Drug Administration's food import data from 2012-14, the Government Accountability Office found that PREDICT, the agency's computerized risk assessment tool, could be more effective. Since the FDA can only physically examine about 1 percent of all the imported food coming into the United States each year, computer tools such as PREDICT are more important than ever. \"PREDICT improves import screening and targeting to prevent entry of adulterated, misbranded or otherwise violative goods, expedites the entry of non-violative goods. PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment for examination. It also expedites the clearance of lower-risk cargo, but only if accurate and complete data are provided by importers and entry filers,\" the FDA explained after it rolled out the system. GAO analysts noted that PREDICT was pretty good at flagging for physical examination those imported food items at higher risk of violating either safety regulations or labeling rules. However, there were two things the FDA could do to make PREDICT even more useful. One is to set up a documentation process to identify those open-source data, acquire these data and then determine how PREDICT should use them. Furthermore, new rules and programs set up under the Food Safety Modernization Act will result in more information for PREDICT to use in helping to assess food safety of imported goods, the GAO reported. — Joana Suleiman ENERGY FERC kicks Berkshire out of the market Billionaire Warren Buffett's holding company is getting booted from participating in the wholesale electric market because it couldn't convince federal regulators that 20 of its power companies aren't a monopoly.

The agency's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, is bringing together experts on plant genetics, information technology and robotics in the search for bioenergy crops that are sustainable, affordable and can yield abundant crops for biofuel. The project is called TERRA, or \"Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture,\" and features researchers \"building robots armed with cutting-edge sensors to collect data on plant characteristics\" to improve the harvest of biofuels. \"Meanwhile, other teams develop tools that use this data to predict which plants will grow more quickly, thrive in stressful environments and generally show greater potential to fuel and feed our planet,\" the agency says. Already built is a robot called the \"Scanalyzer,\" which combines a small ground-based droid with an airborne drone to monitor field production.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at state anti-smoking laws from 2000-14. It found that from 2000-09, 21 states and the District of Columbia implemented smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants, bars and work sites. However, from 2010-14, only five states passed such bans, bringing the total to 26 states. In addition, fewer than one-third of U.S. states have raised their excise tax on cigarettes in recent years.

Former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., created the \"Stop Chris Christie\" PAC last November. Tancredo reportedly said at the time that the group's purpose was to defeat Christie's campaign since the governor is \"no true conservative.\" But in a recent statement posted to the group's Facebook page, treasurer Tom Bjorklund said the group had notified the Federal Election Commission that it would be shutting down the PAC by Sept. 25 due to the \"miserable showing of the candidate in question.\" \"Our committee believes that Mr. Christie has already performed the service of stopping his campaign in spirit, (without or aid) even if not by the letter of the law,\" Bjorklund wrote to Laura Sinram, a senior campaign finance analyst at the FEC. Bjorklund's letter to Sinram was in response to a notification issued by the FEC in July that the group was in violation of federal election rules for using Christie's name without procuring his permission. Two other outside groups associated with Republican hopefuls Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump have also been flagged by the FEC recently for using the candidates' names without their approval. \"Stop Chris Christie\"'s website has already been shut down and Bjorklund says they will spend the next couple weeks communicating with vendors and obtaining closing invoices from individuals who assisted with the committee's formation. According to FEC records, the anti-Christie PAC had only raised $1,350 by the mid-year filing deadline with a total operating expenditure of $8.74. Christie's popularity has plummeted in his home state where voters have grown increasingly frustrated, claiming that he is prioritizing his presidential run over his responsibilities as governor. The two-term governor barely made it into the first Republican primary debate and, although he is set to take the stage again for the second debate on Sept. 19, recent polls in early primary states place him in the bottom half of the GOP field. Polling data from RealClearPolitics currently shows Christie averaging 5.3 percent support among Republican primary voters in New Hampshire and just 2 percent in Iowa. A spokesperson for Christie's camp told the Washington Examiner that the PAC's closure is simply an attempt to dodge an investigation by the FEC.", "_diversity_score": 7.7150239940937615}

We were often accused of scaremongering or warmongering. But then came last Friday. And now that the war has come home — to the streets of a Western city filled with sports fans and music fans and individuals celebrating democratic freedom — the debate is closed. ISIS is at war with the West. And it must be ended. Of course, in the days ahead some will argue that we should keep “Paris in perspective.” Consider this weekend’s erudite assertions by The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf, who cautions against French retaliation because “ill-chosen wars can and do carry more costs than benefits.” This logic is grossly mistaken. Today, as surely as at Pearl Harbor, the choice of war has been imposed by the enemy. From the relative sanctuary of its caliphate, ISIS has now invaded the West with arrogant glee. And although some will say that the terrorist threat remains small — that more people are killed by umbrellas than by terrorist attacks — this single attack of terrorism is an onslaught against our societal fabric. By murdering a range of individuals in a range of social settings and in a range of ways, ISIS is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure. ISIS is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure. However subtle, the gross chilling effect born of this terrorism must not stand. We must annihilate ISIS before it launches new attacks on our way of life. And in France, America now has a capable European ally with which to respond. Although his domestic record is catastrophic , French president François Hollande has proven himself determined in foreign policy, deploying French military forces against al-Qaeda syndicates in Africa and challenging President Obama to take a tougher stance against Iran and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. I expect Hollande will show increasing fortitude in the days ahead. After all, with his proud people shocked but angered, Hollande will want to bring physical meaning to his statement that these attacks were acts of war. And with the European Union increasingly doubted over economic and sovereignty concerns (see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), Hollande will see this moment as a test of the EU’s resiliency. Both these considerations lead me to believe that France will significantly escalate its air campaign against ISIS and commence special-forces ground operations against ISIS leaders and infrastructure. And in this response, France deserves three forms of American support. First, President Obama, who was absent from the Charlie Hebdo memorial, should visit Paris in solidarity. If possible, he should address the French Parliament and offer France U.S. support in the form of escalated military retaliation. Second, he should respond to this attack by energizing a more aggressive and comprehensive campaign against ISIS. Third, President Obama must draw greater attention to allied successes against ISIS. This should include greater publicity (including gun-camera videos) of actions like last week’s air strike on Jihadi John. ISIS leaders and fighters must come to perceive their banner as a magnet for purposeless death, not ordained glory. We must also challenge ISIS in other unconventional fields, such as satire.

Xuan Loc DOAN When he traveled to China for a state visit in October 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was grandly received by Beijing. Nguyen Phu Trong, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), was treated much in the same manner during his official trip to China last week. Yet, while Mr Trong’s visit was aimed at developing stronger ties with China, it does not mean that the communist leadership in Hanoi is pursuing a Duterte-like pivot to Beijing. Closer ties with Beijing Trong’s four-day trip, which started on January 12, was his first to China since being re-elected as the CPV’s leader at its 12th National Congress in January 2016 and his first foreign tour in 2017. He went to Beijing with a high-ranking delegation that included four politburo members in charge of four important departments in Vietnam’s one-party regime – namely central propaganda, foreign affairs, national defense and public security. During the visit, Hanoi and Beijing reached a wide range of agreements aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two ruling parties and the two communist neighbors in various fields and at many levels. Trong’s outing was followed by recent notable trips to the Asian juggernaut by other Vietnamese top officials – including Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Dinh The Huynh, the CPV’s Permanent Secretary, in September and October 2016, respectively. Mr Huynh, an influential politburo member, is tipped to succeed Trong if the 72-year old leader chooses to step down in the near future. All these journeys suggest Hanoi is attaching a greater importance to its cooperation with Beijing and adopting a more friendly posture toward the latter than about six or seven months ago. A combination of factor may contribute to this change. One of these is the fact that China is Vietnam’s closest neighbor, sharing not only land and sea borders but also many political and economic similarities with the former. The world’s most populous country is also Vietnam’s biggest trading partner. Given all of these, coupled with Vietnam’s power asymmetry vis-à-vis its giant neighbor, for the country’s stability – and perhaps for the CPV’s survival – steadying its ties with Beijing is always a priority for Hanoi. Chinese leaders’ current charm diplomacy is also influencing Hanoi’s posture. Mr Trong was the first foreign leader China received in 2017. He was given a red-carpet welcome upon his arrival at the Beijing International Airport and an official welcoming ceremony with full honors at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 12. Five of the seven members of the all-powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China (CPC), including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, held talks with him. Mr Phuc was given a similar treatment when he toured China last September. The warm reception Chinese leaders extended to their Vietnamese “comrades and brothers” indicates that Beijing is also highly valuing Hanoi and its relations with the latter. This, in return, is increasing Vietnam’s trust – or at least, decreasing its mistrust – in Beijing and encouraging it to develop tighter ties with China. It seems tensions and suspicion caused by China’s actions in recent years, notably its placement of its huge oil rig, HS-981, in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in 2014, have now eased", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

It seems tensions and suspicion caused by China’s actions in recent years, notably its placement of its huge oil rig, HS-981, in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in 2014, have now eased. Overt overtures made toward Beijing by several regional countries, particularly Malaysia and the Philippines, are another defining factor. Last November, Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak made a six-day trip to China. During that visit, which was intended to elevate their relationship to “greater heights”, Kuala Lumpur and Beijing signed many new agreements, including Malaysia’s first major defense deal with China. Two weeks before that, President Rodrigo Duterte also made a landmark trip to Beijing, where he eventually and solemnly announced his “separation from the US” and his “dependence” on China, after months of publicly denouncing Washington and praising Beijing. Malaysia’s turn toward Beijing and especially the Philippines’ dramatic tilt away from its long-standing and most important ally to China’s orbit somehow influenced a rethink in Hanoi. Like Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have outstanding territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. For years, they were among the region’s most vocal critics of their northern neighbor’s expansive claims and aggressive actions in this resource-rich and strategically vital water. They all favored multilateral approaches to the maritime disputes. Hanoi supported the Philippines’s South China Sea arbitration and welcomed its landmark legal victory against China last July. Duterte’s wholehearted embrace of China, which resulted in his side-lining of the July ruling and agreeing to enter bilateral talks with Beijing prompted Vietnam to soften its posture and improve relations with China. Last but not least, Donald Trump’s shock rise to the American presidency is also a key reason behind Hanoi’s current accommodating posture toward Beijing. Under the Obama administration, Vietnam and America edged remarkably closer to each other. Their stronger ties were strengthened by – and manifested in – many key developments and agreements. Prominent among these are Mr Trong’s unprecedented trip to Washington in 2015, President Obama’s milestone visit to Vietnam in 2016, during which he officially ended America’s decades-old arms embargo on its former war foe, and Vietnam’s enthusiastic response to America’s Asia pivot and the US-led TPP. Vietnam’s strong economic and strategic ties with the US have been in jeopardy following Trump’s election victory. Faced with the imminent collapse of the TPP and other uncertainties about America’s relations with Asia and Vietnam under Trump, Hanoi is relatively readjusting its foreign policy and improving its ties with Beijing can be seen as part of such recalibration. But not a Duterte-like shift Yet, while becoming more receptive to Beijing, Hanoi is not bandwagoning with the latter; and this is because of many reasons. One of these concerns Vietnam’s economic imbalance with China. Though it has dropped recently, Vietnam’s trade deficit with the world’s second biggest economy remains enormous. According to its General Statistics Office (GSO), in 2016, Vietnam exported (US)$21.8 billion in goods to the world’s largest trading country and imported $49.8", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

According to its General Statistics Office (GSO), in 2016, Vietnam exported (US)$21.8 billion in goods to the world’s largest trading country and imported $49.8 billion from it. This means it had a trade deficit of $28 billion with China last year. For years, Hanoi has asked Beijing to help balance the bilateral trade by creating better conditions for Vietnamese goods to enter the Chinese market. It is reported that in his talk with Nguyen Phu Trong, Xi Jinping promised that China will work harder to make the two countries’ trade relations grow faster and become more balanced. Whether Vietnam’s companies and their goods are provided with a greater access to China following Trong’s visit remains to be seen. Yet, in any case, it will take years or decades, if ever, for Vietnam to balance its trade with China. For this reason – and in order to avoid economic overdependence on its giant neighbor and to sustain its economic development – Vietnam needs good relations with its other major trading partners, notably the European Union and the US, with which it has enjoyed a huge trade surplus in recent years. In 2016, Vietnam exported US$34 billion (in goods) to the EU, its third largest trading partner, and US$38.1 billion to the US. As America is Vietnam’s biggest export market and second largest trader, while it is unclear how Donald Trump will view and approach his country’s relations with Vietnam, it is certain that Hanoi will try its best to sustain and improve its ties with Washington. Another reason why Vietnam is seeking better relations with the US and other powers, including Japan and India, is its unresolved maritime disputes with China. During Trong’s China visit, both sides pledged to manage maritime differences and avoid any acts that may complicate the situation and escalate tensions in the South China Sea. Nevertheless, after “candidly” exchanging their views on issue, they could not yet accept each other’s main position. According to a report by the VOV, Vietnam’s national radio broadcaster, in his talk with his Chinese counterpart, Trong “asserted Vietnam’s consistent stance of persistently dealing with the dispute in the East Sea [Vietnam’s name for the South China Sea] by peaceful measures in compliance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and with respect to diplomatic and legal processes.” In contrast, as manifested by its vehement objection to the Philippines’ arbitration case, Beijing has stringently opposed any legal approach to resolve the disputes. Instead, it has forcibly insisted on bilateral negotiations. Their joint communique mentioned neither of these two positions. Given China’s expansive claims and its past and recent actions in the South China Sea, Vietnam does not expect – though it strongly hopes – that Beijing will willingly accept a peaceful solution to the dispute based on the principles of international law, including UNCLOS. That is why it has hedged – and continues to hedge – against any aggressive move by China by forging strong ties with global and regional powers,", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

That is why it has hedged – and continues to hedge – against any aggressive move by China by forging strong ties with global and regional powers, notably those that are also concerned about Beijing’s hegemonic ambitions. This is supported by the fact that whilst Trong was holding talks with Chinese leaders in Beijing, in Hanoi Nguyen Xuan Phuc received John Kerry. The latter’s visit might not have a major impact on future US-Vietnam cooperation. Yet, in his talk with the outgoing US Secretary of State, the Vietnamese premier expressed his delight at achievements in US-Vietnam relations and Vietnam’s desire to reinforce bilateral ties. This shows the Vietnamese leadership really values its relationship with Washington. Just a day after Trong returned from China, Hanoi received Shinzo Abe. In their separate meetings with the Japanese Prime Minister, the Southeast Asian country’s top four leaders – party chief, state president, prime minister and parliament chairwoman – all affirmed Hanoi’s desire to deepen economic and strategic ties with Japan. For his part, during this two-day visit, Mr Abe pledged to provide Vietnam with six new coastguard patrols. The patrol vessels, worth $338 million, were part of the $1-billion loan Tokyo offered Hanoi. Vietnam-Japan relations have significantly advanced in recent years and this is mainly due to their shared concerns over China’s maritime ambitions and actions. Such apprehensions have also brought Vietnam closer to India, China’s other key regional rival. Six months ago, before Phuc’s China trip, Hanoi hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During that landmark visit, the first official trip to Vietnam by an Indian prime minister since 2001, the two countries elevated their “strategic partnership” to “comprehensive strategic partnership” and New Delhi agreed to provide Vietnam with a $500 million defense loan. All of these demonstrate that while it may prioritize relations with Beijing, Hanoi is also seeking stronger ties with other powers, notably the US, Japan and India, to counterbalance China, both economically and strategically. It is also evident that the Vietnamese leadership is not overtly leaning toward Beijing and submitting to the latter’s maritime position as President Duterte has done. Following Duterte’s China visit last October, during which he publicly promised to shift his country’s allegiance from Washington to Beijing, some international relations experts, notably those from China, predicted that America’s other Asian partners, such as Vietnam, may follow suit. Ahead of Trong’s visit last week, an article in the Global Times, a spin-off of the People’s Daily, the CPC’s mouthpiece, also suggested that the shift in diplomacy by the Philippine leader “sets a good example for the other Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam.” Judging by Mr Trong’s assertion of Vietnam’s maritime position in his talk with the Chinese leader and other diplomatic and strategic moves recently taken by Hanoi, it is apparent that Vietnamese leaders are not following Mr Duterte’s steps or “example”.

Aside from questioning 81 witnesses that had never before been interviewed by congressional investigators, the select committee reviewed thousands of previously undisclosed documents and drew new conclusions about the administration's handling of the terror attack. Below are nine things the Benghazi committee uncovered in its 25-month investigation. Email server Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account and server was unknown to previous congressional committees that looked into the circumstances surrounding Benghazi. Dozens of emails discussing the attack and Libya were hidden on that server, including some that shed light on how Clinton and her aides initially sought to take \"ownership\" of the Libyan invasion. When news of Clinton's private email use first broke in March 2015, the Benghazi committee seemingly entered a new, highly-politicized phase. Her server scandal took off just as she was preparing to enter the presidential race, injecting partisan vitriol into an investigation that had proceeded in relative quiet up to that point. The examination of Clinton's private emails led the committee to a previously unknown force that had helped shape the secretary of state's policy in the run-up to Benghazi: Sidney Blumenthal. Blumenthal behind the scenes A divisive political operative who was barred from working in the Obama administration, Sidney Blumenthal provided unvetted intelligence to Clinton about Libya even as he attempted to cultivate business opportunities in the war-torn country. Blumenthal appeared before the committee in June 2015, where his commercial dealings and potential conflicts of interest were questioned in a closed-door interview. At issue was the fact that a partisan figure had a direct line to the secretary of state on matters as sensitive as the regime change in Libya. In fact, many of Blumenthal's missives to Clinton have since been marked classified by the State Department. The extent of Blumenthal's influence was not uncovered in previous investigations of Benghazi. Hillary's upcoming visit The select committee revealed Clinton herself was set to visit Libya weeks after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack, a plan that was scrapped after the Benghazi raid. That scheduled trip was one of many instances that highlighted the State Department's severe misreading of the security situation in Libya. Clinton's planned visit had implications for Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was laying the groundwork for her travel when he was killed in the attack Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission in Libya, told committee investigators the ambassador's stay in Benghazi was \"absolutely\" related to Clinton's visit. Permanent post Stevens had journeyed to Benghazi to work on a \"deliverable\" for Clinton's upcoming trip, the select committee revealed. His work on that deliverable involved preparing a proposal to turn the temporary diplomatic compound in Benghazi into a permanent post. \"[W]e had begun the process of developing a political rationale for having a permanent post in Benghazi,\" Hicks testified. The report said State Department discussions of Benghazi's deteriorating security situation earlier in 2012 framed outbreaks of violence as \"anomalies\" as officials forged ahead with a plan to establish a diplomatic presence in the coastal Libyan city. Given his now-famous affection for the people of Libya, Stevens was an advocate of the plan.

Gadhafi rescuers The select committee discovered a group that \"most U.S. Government personnel did not even know existed\" helped the Americans trapped at the CIA annex escape on the morning of Sept. 12. \"This group, ironically, had close ties to the former Gadhafi regime — the very regime the United States had helped remove from power,\" the report said. The report credited that group, which was affiliated with deposed dictator Muammar Gadhafi, with sparing \"dozens of lives.\" According to the select committee's findings, a CIA agent who had never previously been interviewed by other congressional investigators facilitated the evacuation with the Gadhafi militia's help. The CIA was \"reluctant\" to allow the committee to interview that agent. The \"Libyan Military Intelligence,\" as the group was known, arrived with a motorcade of 50 vehicles to transport the State Department and CIA personnel under siege at the annex to the airport, where they could be evacuated to Tripoli. Some of those vehicles were fitted with machine guns and others had secure fixtures that would allow the fleet to escape with the Americans while taking fire. The CIA agent in question had contacted the Libyan Military Intelligence for help after receiving a referral from a \"helpless\" contingent of local police officers who had been tapped to secure the annex but proved unable to do so. The committee focused on the fact that, for all of the State Department's focus on cultivating relationships with the burgeoning Libyan government, the only people who tried to help the Americans were those cast aside by the agency. \"[S]ome of the very individuals the United States had helped remove from power during the Libyan revolution were the only Libyans that came to the assistance of the United States on the night of the Benghazi attacks,\" the report said. Uniform problems Marines in Rota, Spain who were awaiting orders to head for Benghazi experienced hours of delay due to concern about what they were wearing, one witness told the select committee. After C-130 planes reached the base and the Marines, who were part of a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team known as a FAST force, prepared to take off for Tripoli, a three-hour delay ensued due to deliberations about whether the company members should wear their military uniforms or civilian clothes, and whether they would be permitted to carry weapons. \"[W]e were told multiple times to change what we were wearing,\" the platoon commander testified. \"There was also some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons.\" The commander testified that he advocated for his team to be allowed to carry weapons because they were headed into \"a very violent thing going on the ground.\" In all, the Marines were forced to change their clothes four times before they were deployed to Libya, according to testimony.

That delay had come after the C-130s took six hours to arrive from Germany despite receiving orders to fly there at once. \"The fact that nearly twenty-four hours elapsed until those [FAST] forces actually arrived in Tripoli to reinforce the security there belies the expectations of the American people that the U.S. Military can and will move expeditiously,\" the committee report said. Discussions over whether to force the FAST Marines to wear civilian clothes took place in Washington, where high-level officials expressed concerns about a military show of force in Libya. \"[T]hey wanted to minimize the signature that looked like a big military invasion, a big military arrival there,\" one witness testified. Rather than increase the safety of the Marines en route to Benghazi, \"the benefit of having the FAST platoon wear civilian clothing was to cater to unexpressed Libyan Government concerns about military appearances,\" the report said. According to the report, Patrick Kennedy, the State Department's undersecretary for management, suggested the FAST platoon shed their uniforms during a key White House meeting the night of the attack. White House meeting Around 7:30 p.m. Washington time on the night of the raid, high-level officials gathered via secure video teleconference to discuss the events unfolding in Benghazi. Neither President Obama nor Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was present. Clinton attended, as well as several of her top aides and Kennedy. The meeting was not convened until four hours after the attack began. Sean Smith and Stevens had already died. \"Despite the Secretary [of Defense]'s expectation the assets he ordered to deploy would move as fast as possible in order to respond, the individuals who participated in the White House meeting, nevertheless, felt the need to 'work through' the assets the Secretary had already ordered to deploy,\" the report said. Republicans on the committee noted that meeting participants became \"surprisingly unable to recall details\" about what was discussed that night when they were questioned by investigators. Although an email sent by the Pentagon's chief of staff just before the conference indicated forces were \"spinning up\" and preparing to deploy, the report indicated \"it was clear by the end of the White House meeting that no forces were going to Benghazi.\" Diplomatic niceties Administration officials placed tremendous importance on the way their actions would be perceived in Libya during the attack, the report found. For example, military assets in Europe were not allowed to take off for Benghazi until the administration received clearance from the Libyan government to enter Libyan airspace. But the process was lengthy and required a Libyan government official to receive paperwork for the request in person when no such official was on duty overnight as the attacks were unfolding. Before the raid even began, diplomatic concerns prevented the State Department from greenlighting a higher security profile for the ambassador in Benghazi even though the conditions in the country warranted one.

Internal correspondence obtained by the committee suggests that, rather than receiving conflicting intelligence on the matter, the administration knew within hours that the attack in Benghazi had little to do with the demonstrations in Cairo. \"For [press] guidance, if pressed whether we see a connection between these two. We have no information regarding a connection between these incidents.\" Nuland wrote of the events in Benghazi and Cairo within two hours of the administration learning of the Benghazi attack.

Is happiness a passing feeling or a state of being for you? Tons of articles (and books) have been written about how to be happy, and there is some good information out there. I have read and synthesised hundreds of hours of research and experiments here for you, in this action-driven article. What you will find is some deep, life-changing stuff. If you think that all talk about “how to be happy” is fluffy material and common sense, you are in it for a change. There is a theory in Psychology called the hedonic treadmill, which says that great events (like winning a lottery) and terrible events (like losing a leg) can happen in your life, but after a while you are always back to your “baseline happiness”. If that is true, then more important than trying to change your external life is to actually improve your baseline happiness. This is the focus of this article – and not “feel happy” strategies. Each item here is concluded with a suggested action step. And at the end of the post you will find a link to download a PDF with all of them ? Understanding what authentic happiness is Is happiness a feeling or a state of being? What is its nature, and what are its causes? Wikipedia defines happiness as “a mental or emotional state of well-being characterized by positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy”. There can never be, any objective measurement of happiness based on external achievements. It is an interpretation of reality, and not a result of reality. Actually, happiness is such a loaded term, that I wonder if it is the right one for what we are truly seeking. I personally prefer to speak of fulfillment, contentment, and well-being. The greeks, on the other hand, spoke of eudamonia, the “well-lived life” The problem seems to be understanding what causes human beings to continually experience this state. My research and self-experiments have led me to believe (that) there are three “kinds” of happiness: personal, transpersonal, (and) transcendental. Personal happiness. Most people live by the belief that happiness is simply the result of accumulating as many pleasurable moments as possible, and of fulfilling one’s desires. Money, possessions, food, fun, sex, fame, power. Here is both the trap of “living as if there is no tomorrow” (the hedonistic blind focus in the present) and “living in hope of a better tomorrow” (putting off happiness to the achievement of a future goal). The problem with this is that the pursuit of these pleasures and achievements can often be a painful and frustrating process (that is, an unhappy process). Besides, the happy-feeling resulting from these achievements is short-lived and usually less glorious than the promise (see Havard psychologist Daniel Gilbert on “miswanting” ). On top of that, in many cases we must fight hard to keep what was gained. Finally, even if we are those rare beings that can always easily get and keep what we want, without much pain associate(d) with it, the inevitable result after a while is boredom and indifference. Not really the definition of a fulfilled life, right? Sounds more like an ocean of trouble, with some islands of happy feelings. The verbs for personal happiness are: “to get”, “to feel”, “to achieve”. Transpersonal happiness.", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

Not really the definition of a fulfilled life, right? Sounds more like an ocean of trouble, with some islands of happy feelings. The verbs for personal happiness are: “to get”, “to feel”, “to achieve”. Transpersonal happiness. Scientific research in the field of positive psychology, pioneered by Dr. Martin Seligman, PhD, proposes that a higher “zone” of happiness is to use one’s unique qualities and perspective in the service of something larger than oneself. This “higher cause” can revolve around family, community, science, art, world reform, spiritual transformation, etc.Here, happiness is more of a process, a continuum. A path, rather than an event. And because its cause is larger than one’s ego, so is the resulting joy. Have a look at the PERMA Model of happiness to learn more. The verbs for transpersonal happiness are: “to do”, “to grow”, “to impact” Transcendental happiness. A more uncommon view of happiness, proposed by many eastern traditions, is that it is our natural state of being. Our true self. If it is natural to us, why then is it not experience always? Just like health is inherent to our body but is disturbed by bad habits and bad food, happiness is inherent to our heart but disturbed by negative mindsets. The verbs for transcendental happiness are: “to be”, “to discover”, “to transform”. These three “kinds” are not self-excluding. Each one has its place and you can have it all. Ready to explore what are the causes of true well-being and lasting satisfaction in life? Let’s do this! Part 1 – THE ESSENTIAL 1. Discover your true values The single most important element in living a fulfilling life is understanding your true personal values, and aligning you existence to them. By “values” I don’t mean personal qualities like “honesty” and “integrity” – I mean those activities & goals that most consume your soul. It is what you are hungry for. Those things that you love to think about, read about, talk about, learn about. Examples of values: family, building your career, athletic performance, art, spirituality, travelling, being a thought leader, developing your business, etc. It’s more of a doing, not a having. How to discover your values? Take some minutes to look deeper into yourself and your life, and it will tell you where you naturally focus your valuable resources (time, energy, money, attention). Actually take the time to do this. Here are some guiding questions: How do you spend your free time? How do you spend your money? What in your life are you most reliable, disciplined and focused? What do you most think about and dream about? What do you love to learn, read about, and explore? What inspires you the most? Fast forward your life 10 years and look back. You are proud of achieving one thing. What is that? The elements that appear repeatedly are your core values. It is here that you will find your passion", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

You are proud of achieving one thing. What is that? The elements that appear repeatedly are your core values. It is here that you will find your passion, your direction. They are your map for every single decision in your life. Your map for a happy life. This is such a deep topic that it deserves a post of itself (and probably will get). For now, to learn more about core values, I highly recommend the book The Breakthrough Experience, by Dr. John F. Demartini, an expert in this field. Action step: Give yourself 20~30 minutes to contemplate on those questions and discover your core 3-4 values. If you are busy now, put in some time in your calendar for later ? 2. How to be happy? Align your life to your values Your happiness is where your values are. It is what we want to do, what makes us alive. The more your daily thoughts and activities are in harmony with your values, the happier you are. This is also one of the power tool of coaches. Now put your values in order, with the most important ones on top. And examine how much juice they are getting in the different aspects of your life. How much money, time, and energy are you spending on them? Are they actively directing your life, your daily choices? Or are they being suffocated and forgotten in the maze of the practicalities of living and other less important things? How can your authentic self be more in the steering wheel of your life? Action step: Understand how much your core values are directing your life or not. Commit to making 3 simple changes to increase their power. 3. Leave aside the unessential – the art of saying “no” Are you feeling overwhelmed with tasks? Maybe lacking headspace, or direction in life? Then you might have said yes to many things that are not truly essential, or not in harmony with your personal values. Therefore, there is no space to move, or not enough energy to build what is really meaningful for you. That extra project you took; the extra credit card; the relationship you are keeping and you don’t really care about; the stuff you bought and don’t really need; the old habits that are lurking around but have no meaning anymore. When making decisions, every “yes” is a commitment to something, and a closure to other things. It is allowing something – an activity, a place, a person, a task – to occupy valuable resources in your life. You can produce more money, but the time spent on something or someone will never come back. Saying “yes” to anything also demands our commitment of energy and headspace (an increasingly rare commodity these days). The inability to say no is actually rooted in fear. Fear of missing out an opportunity; fear of closing a door that we can never again reopen. But we simply cannot have it all. And we fail to see that this fear is actually the very cause that makes us close many other doors.", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

Fear of missing out an opportunity; fear of closing a door that we can never again reopen. But we simply cannot have it all. And we fail to see that this fear is actually the very cause that makes us close many other doors. To explore more on this, check out Dan Ariely’s classic Predictably Irrational. “Is this thing I`m thinking of saying ‘yes’ to gonna supporting my core values or not?”, “How is this decision affect my present and future self?” Answering these questions, from moment to moment, is the human journey. In simple terms, our life, impact, and well-being, is determined by what we say yes to. It is a collective of yeses and nos. “No” is not a negative word. It is not aggressive. It is not rejection. It is not selfish. It is focus. “No” is a powerful word, and can be used powerfully. All geniuses of humanity – in art, sport, politics, literature, science – were saying “yes” to a few things, and “no” to everything else. They were not chasing the next shining object. “I don’t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody” (Bill Cosby)1 The contemplation of our finite nature, of limitation, of death, pushes human beings to accomplish extraordinary things, to live amazing lives. That is why many people that go through near-death experiences have their life transformed. For the better. They stop saying yes to things that don’t really matter to them, and start focusing on what is really important. That is why the movement of Minimalism is gaining traction in modern society. For more on this topic, I recommend Joshua Becker’s blog, Becoming Minimalist, and this TED talk. The foundation of a “happy life”, therefore, is to discover our core values, align our life and actions to them, and religiously say “no” to all the needless things that are not in service. Trust your heart and your gut if you feel that a person or activity is simply not for you. Action step: Write down 5 things you want to start saying “no” to in life. Take note of what you are losing (time, energy, money, head space) by allowing those things to creep in. 4. Act based on creative freedom – not conditioning Since birth we have been exposed to so much conditioning – from our family, friends, society, media, environment. And still continue to be bombarded by thousands of messages every day. These outside voices have been heard and repeated so many times that they start having an independent life inside of us. No wonder it is hard to find our true voice, as opposed to the voice of other people’s opinions.

This process can take time to mature in us. Taking some time alone, apart from all that is familiar from us, can help. Meditation, travel & retreats can give us the space to discover ourselves. A life coach can also be of service. According to Australian nurse Bronnie Ware, who spent many years working with patients on their last weeks of life, the top regret of the dying is “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.” Your values will be your rule of thumb when deciding what is your voice and what is conditioning. Action step: Next time you feel unsure what path to take, use your core values to discern your true path from your conditioning. Be determined to act based on your higher good, and not based on what you believe you “should do”. 5. Live the present, but don’t hunt the short-term Being exclusively present-oriented or future oriented are both points of unbalance To be in the trap that “I`ll be happy when…” is a cause of unhappiness. To be missing or sacrificing the present – the beautiful nature, the human relations, the rest needed, the peace and joy of being here and breath – is a cause of unhappiness. Believing happiness to be “in the future” is not only a risky assumption, but also betrays the concept of happiness as a state of being. It is not in the achievement of your goals – it is in the process of living your values. But to live as if there is no tomorrow, to focus only on short-term goals is the other extreme of this scale. And is not sustainable either. In his classic book, Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman describes an experiment in which four-year old kids are left in a room alone and told they can have two marshmallows if they wait for the experimenter to return from an errand. If they can’t wait till then, they can have only one marshmallow, but they can have it now. Some kids were able to hold off the fifteen to twenty minutes while others jumped on the one marshmallow – almost always within seconds. Years later the same kids were interviewed, and Goleman discovered that their ability to delay gratification revealed a great deal about the trajectory that child would likely take in their lives. The scholar concluded that “There is perhaps no psychological skill more fundamental than resisting impulse.” It is curious that many times our success in the short-term is exactly the reason of our failure in the long-term. Living day by day with a higher direction in mind, yet with our feet on the ground, seems to be the balance point between present and future. A balance between enjoying the now and designing the future. Action step: Take note of 5 things that you are sacrificing in your present, for the promise of a better future. Then write down 5 places in your life where your focus", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

Don’t chase extrinsic values While focus on extrinsic life values may lead to a quicker satisfaction of these desires, true fulfilment will not be found down this path. On the other hand, there are countless testimonials of people that focused first on the “important stuff” in life and, as a result, also got the extrinsic goals met. There is a lot of research in this sense. PhD professor Ronald Inglehart, found that once middle-class comforts are in place, the link between wealth and wellbeing “is surprisingly weak (indeed, virtually negligible).” In his best-selling book on the science of motivation,Why We Do What We Do, Edward Deci tells us: “The researchers found that if any of the three extrinsic aspirations – for money, fame, or beauty – was very high for an individual relative to the three intrinsic aspirations, the individual was also more likely to display poorer mental health. For example, having an unusually strong aspiration for material success was associated with narcissism, anxiety, depression, and poorer social functioning as rated by a trained clinical psychologist…In contrast, strong aspirations for any of the intrinsic goals – meaningful relationships, personal growth, and community contributions – were positively associated with well-being. People who strongly desired to contribute to their community, for example, had more vitality and higher self-esteem. When people organize their behavior in terms of intrinsic strivings (relative to extrinsic strivings) they seem more content – they feel better about who they are and display more evidence of psychological health.” Action step: Review your core values. What is driving you in life? Are these extrinsic values or intrinsic values? If they are extrinsic, what is the bigger value behind them? 7. Be careful how you feed your senses Our body is fed by food, water, and other elements; our mind is fed through ideas and the five senses. The quality of our mind and internal wellbeing is profoundly formed by the things we see, listen to, watch, smell, touch, read, think about, etc. How are you feeding your senses? The music you choose to hear affects your moods. Depending on the genre, it can make you inspired, calm, emotional; or violent, depressed, confused. The same goes with the movies we watch, books we read, and all other types of media, environment, food (here and here), and people. Action step: Make a list of the top five things that you are feeding your senses and do not serve your wellbeing. Reflect whether you really need these things in your life or not. Commit to one small change. 8. Find a place of", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

The same goes with the movies we watch, books we read, and all other types of media, environment, food (here and here), and people. Action step: Make a list of the top five things that you are feeding your senses and do not serve your wellbeing. Reflect whether you really need these things in your life or not. Commit to one small change. 8. Find a place of Flow “Flow” is that beautiful state of total integration in your present activity. You are there with your whole body, mind and soul, and its as if you disappear, and there is nothing else in the world. Total concentration. Maybe it is when you are running, or reading a great book, or giving a speech, or drawing. Perhaps when thinking deeply about some matter, or when meditating. Different people access the Flow according to their own passion. It is what moves artists, athletes, writers, and entrepreneurs to give their whole selves into their project. It is also one of the cornerstones of the Daoist philosophy. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of Finding Flow, and one of the pioneers in this research, wrote: “In all the activities people in our study reported engaging in, enjoyment comes at a very specific point: whenever the opportunities for action perceived by the individual are equal to his or her capabilities. Playing tennis, for instance, is not enjoyable if the two opponents are mismatched. The less skilled player will feel anxious, and the better player will feel bored. The same is true for every other activity… Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.” To expand on this topic, check out this article on the blog Pursuit-Of-Happiness. Action step: What are the activities in your life that you are more likely to find Flow? How can you deepen your involvement in these activities? 9. Nurture your Spirituality Several studies point out the relationship between spiritual development and personal well-being. A 2012 review of more than 326 studies of mainly adult populations found that out of those 326 studies, 256 (79%) found only positive associations between religiosity/spirituality and well-being. For some people, spirituality come through their religion; but spirituality and religion are different things. You can be spiritual without being religious – that is, without joining any religion or church. Spirituality does not require you do give your power away to some external person or institution, nor to have blind faith; it is not dogmatic nor ritualistic. It is not a cult. It does not limit your freedom and it does not make you close minded. As a side note, there studies that show benefits of meditation regardless of belief or religious inclination. True spirituality is an invitation to look deeper into your life, your values, and discover your true Self. Exploring this topic more in-depth will be a subject of other posts. For now, you can start by reading some meditation quotes. Action step: Start looking for ways to develop your spirituality, a deeper perspective and values in life. 10.

Master your mind Buddhism and other ancient traditions emphasise that our mind can be our greatest friend or our worst enemy. It can make our life heaven or hell. “More than those who hate you, more than all your enemies, an undisciplined mind does greater harm.” – The Buddha There is no doubt about this – there can be no happiness while we are enslaved by our own shadows. No factor seems to be more important for our wellbeing than the state of our minds. And yet, for the average person up to 70% of ones thoughts is negative self-talk. This leads to emotional overload and stress. “Ok, I get it”, I hear you say, “but how to control the mind?”. Thing is, you cannot control the first thought that arises in the mind in any given situation – that is simply a conditioned response. But you can exercise control over the second thought and the ones after. Here lies your power (and responsibility). For example, I`m sitting in the couch in a Sunday afternoon and the thought arises “I`m lonely”. Whether I “accept” this and continue on this train of thought (“yeah, nobody loves me…”, etc.) or simply let it pass, its my choice. I can also choose to instead think “yes, I`m alone at this moment, but its good, I need some self-space”. One way leads to anxiety, victimization and self-pity – the other doesn’t. Thousands of times per day we make choices like this, although most times it is automatic and we are not aware of it. Becoming aware of our mind processes and exercising our power to direct our attention is the mastery of the mind. And this is greatly facilitated by practices such as meditation and mindfulness. There are also techniques developed by psychologists. The message, here, is that the way you feel, the way you think, is not a necessity. It is merely a learned habit. It is, in great part, arbitrary. You have the power to change it. You are giving power to your thoughts by thinking them, by engaging in a conversation with them, and believing them. If they are creating suffering, remember that you have the power to think something different. The mind cannot hold on to two opposite feelings at the same time, so focusing on developing positive thought patterns and emotions already goes a long way. Watch Mathieu Ricard (ex-Phd scientist turned monk) expand on this. Action step: Become aware of your internal dialogs. Be vigilant of your negative thoughts. Next time negative thinking kicks in, exercise your power to redirect your thoughts to something else, to reinterpret the facts, or to simply ignore. In the beginning you will succeed only for a few seconds. With practice and persistence, however, it becomes natural and easy.

PART 2 – MINDSET & ATTITUDES Some mindsets empower a life of success and fulfilment; others create difficulties and pain. These can be learned by experience (the hard way), by reading good personal development material, by engaging with mentors and life coaches, or by reflection and meditation. Here are my findings from these learning paths. 11. Face everything as an opportunity to grow. This is probably the most empowering attitude I’ve ever encountered. It is a good medicine against many of the causes of fear, frustration, impatience, anxiety, and stress. If you face every event, every challenge, as part of the way, then nothing can disturb you. You will not fear, nor complain, nor blame, nor be pissed off by things that happen. Instead, in your mind there will be only the question: “What can I learn from this?”. An event doesn’t mean anything by itself; it is always only what you make of it. You have the power to make it positive or negative. You get a “no” as an answer. Your car breaks. It’s raining on a Sunday again. You can’t finish your project. Got sick. Nobody is buying your product. Your son doesn’t listen to you. You can resist these things. Close yourself up. Fight them. You now have a problem, and that is unfortunate. Or you can be open. Breath deeply. Acknowledge what is there. Look for your lesson, and for the next step. You now simply have a new context, and that is an opportunity. Performance psychologist John Eliot, author of the somewhat controversial Overachievement, has a very interesting expression: “eat stress like an energy bar”. Yes, even emotions like stress, anger, envy, can be used for something positive, as motivators for action. Depending on our attitude these energies can be empowering or disempowering. Life’s challenges are polishing you, preparing you for bigger things. Action step: Next time a challenge comes, kiss its face, learn the lesson, and move on. 12. Expectation creates disappointment Expectation is wishful thinking about the future. It sets a self-imposed standard of what is to happen. A bit like drawing a line on the sand and deciding that “if it is above this line I`ll be happy; if not, I`ll be upset”. Some expectations are natural, and not as harmful. When I buy a product from the supermarket, I expect it to not be rotten, and will have an unpleasant surprise if it is. Other expectations, however, are just a recipe for disaster. For instance, expecting things to be easy when learning something, or working on my business, or trying to navigate through life, will create a lot of frustration. If, instead, I expect things to be hard, I’ll be well prepared. If they turn out to be easy, I`m happy; if they turn out to be hard… well, no surprises here. After all, usually what is worth having doesn", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

After all, usually what is worth having doesn’t comes easy. Similarly, hoping to get lucky, to be accepted, to have quick success, to have no conflicts – all these expectations bring about pain. We’d be better off just doing what we need to do and leaving the future to take care of itself. While it may be impossible to live without any expectations at all, when we learn to be more conservative and “soft” about our expectations, we suffer less the consequences of their violation. Keeping in mind that they are arbitrary and self-imposed, we tend to have more flexibility and flow. Manage your expectations, and you will rarely be disappointed. Check out also the create posts about the subject on LifeHacker, Huffington Post and Tiny Buddha. Action step: What needless expectations are you imposing on yourself right now? Do you really need them? 13. Yesterday is graveyard… How to forget the past and reinvent your history Victimization, remorse, guilt, regret. No doubt these are unhappy feelings, and they all have something in common: they are anchored in the past. What are you dwelling on? Your past failures? A betrayal? A gaffe you made on the last dinner party? Something unjust that happened to you? The past is good for one thing only: learning. We need to reflect on what has happened, learn from it, and move on. Your past does not define you – unless you allow it to. You are not what has happened to you; you are what you choose to become. You mind defines you. And mind creates what it constantly thinks about. Suddenly over thinking the past doesn’t sound like a good idea anymore… It is usually pain (and not pleasure), that keeps us looking back. The desire to “correct” the past is one of the main reasons why we get stuck in it. And yet this desire goes against a basic law of nature. If we reflect deeply about how this tendency is hurting our present, how it is hindering our life here and now, we will have the motivation needed to make a decision to let go and stop looking back. Of course, if possible it also helps to get physically apart from places and people who take you back to your past. Another approach is to actually reinvent your past. Yes, it is possible, and it is not hallucination. The fact is, the past that we remember is what we have subjectively experienced, not the raw facts. It is the facts + our thinking/feeling. It is not reality, but rather our colourful description of it – and we have the power to change this. If somebody did something bad to us, we cannot start believing that they simply didn’t do that (we actually can, but that’s delusional); but we can change our belief about what that means to us. And that basically changes everything, because for the rest of our life we will remember", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

And that basically changes everything, because for the rest of our life we will remember our story of the event, it’s ending, and not the experience of the event. Morty Lefkoe, author of the best-seller Re-Create Your Life, teaches a process that can be used to reinterpret past events in a simple way: Identify the undesirable pattern Name the underlying belief Identify the source of the belief in memory, including as much sensory detail as possible Describe possible alternate interpretations of the memory Realize that your original belief is an interpretation, not reality Consciously choose to reject the original belief as “false” Consciously choose to accept your reinterpretation as “true” Both interpretations are valid. Your reality will be defined by the one you choose to accept. Your choice. Action step: Identify where in your past you usually get stuck in, and go through the reinterpretation process. 14. Accept the things you cannot control or change Whether we like it or not, many things in life we cannot change. We cannot change other people, nor the behaviour of the market. Other things can be changed, but only with colossal effort during a long period of time. Accepting reality is not a passive attitude. It does not make us weak. It does require humility, of course, but it empowers us to respond to life in a wiser, more effective, way. We cannot fight all battles. So let’s choose wisely what to accept, and what to focus to change. Action step: Are you struggling to accept some major reality in yourself or your life? What would happen if instead of asking “how can I change this” you asked “how can I make use of this?” 15. Move in the direction of your fears Yes, you read that right. Have this determination that no fear must arise unmet. Have this obsession that every fear must be confronted and conquered. This unleashing of your inner hero will deepen your life and broaden your heart. Fear is one of the most instinctive human emotions. It can take many forms, such as worry (fear about future circumstances), doubt (fear about making the wrong choice) and hatred (the aggressive response to the feared object). Most likely you will experience it your whole life, so it might be a good idea to learn how to deal with it. The problem is not that fear arises. The problem, if any, is how you respond to it. Yes, believe it or not, you have total freedom as to how to respond. Maybe it is hard to experience it, because you might not have exercised this mind-muscle much. But it’s there. Experiencing danger & risk, can be character building as well. Even for your kids. A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. And skilled sailors have a depth in their live that novices don’t.

A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. And skilled sailors have a depth in their live that novices don’t. Happy are those that are bigger than their fears. And how to be bigger than your fear? Act bigger than your fear. When in doubt, close your eyes and take the leap. Don’t cling to something just because of fear. It makes you a prisoner. Hey! Fear is not a big deal. Just some electrical impulses in your brain, coupled with a bit of chemicals running through your blood. Will this keep you powerless while life runs you by? Action step: Think of something that makes you afraid. Take one small step every day in the direction of that fear. It’s important that it be a small step, otherwise you may lose motivation. Feel the confidence that comes from acting despite the fear. Gradually increase the boldness of your actions. 16. Embrace impermanence Not understanding and accepting impermanence is a cause of unhappiness. Impermanence is the fundamental law of our existence. This is the only thing that is certain in this life: everything changes. Time eats away everything, and nothing remains the same. Your time will be spent. Money will be gone. Many things that you cared about will either disappear, or you will no longer care about them. The good news is that whatever negative feeling or unpleasant situation you are experiencing will also pass. There was a time when it did not exist; then it shows up for a limited time, and after that it goes back to not existing. Several ancient traditions emphasised the need to contemplate the fleeting nature of our lives, from Buddha to the Stoics (who called this exercise Memento Mori). A deeper life opens up when we understand and embrace impermanence and our mortality, and learn its lessons. A deep (and often unnoticed) fear in our hearts is released once we accept impermanence down to our bones. As a result we get more focused, and we are freed up to live a more amazing life. Action step: Spend some time reflecting about how everything constantly changes. Think of something that you are very attached to, or a situation that is bothering you. Realize that this too shall pass. 17. Happy thoughts – choosing optimism, choosing happiness Yes, wellbeing and happiness is a matter of choice. “Habits of thinking need not be forever. One of the most significant findings in psychology in the last twenty years is that individuals can choose the way they think.” – Martin Seligman from Learned Optimism In this wonderful book the author explains the difference between optimism and the (much in vogue) “positive thinking”: the former is learning a new set of cognitive skills, while the later is repeating “positive affirmations” to yourself. And the skills we need to learn is that of changing our “explanatory styles”, which is how we chose to talk to ourselves when interpreting what’s happening. The following experiment was made with two dogs. The first dog is slightly shocked but has a lever he can push to stop the shocks.", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

And the skills we need to learn is that of changing our “explanatory styles”, which is how we chose to talk to ourselves when interpreting what’s happening. The following experiment was made with two dogs. The first dog is slightly shocked but has a lever he can push to stop the shocks. He quickly learns to stop the shocks. He’s in good “psychological” shape. A second dog does not have a lever, so he can’t stop the shocks. His shocks stop only when the first dog hits his lever. So, in effect, the shocks are random for him. Our second dog “learns” that he is helpless in the face of these shocks. Here’s what’s fascinating: The dogs are then moved to a new area and taught a new way to avoid the shocks. So, now they can BOTH avoid the shocks at will. Remarkably, although the first dog avoids the shocks, the second dog curls up in the corner and whimpers as the shock – which he could have avoided – is administered. He has learned helplessness. The second dog may feel sorry for himself. He may blame the first dog. He may complain. All of these are disempowering. Or he may learn to see things differently. We condition ourselves through our own self-talk, and then become prisoners of our interpretations, and blind to reality. Whether you tell yourself that you can or can’t, you are right. That is why if you want to create instant change in your life, watching your self-language seems a great place to start. How you describe your reality is how you define it, how you create it. Here is the model the author proposes for an optimist explanatory style: Permanence – is what happened likely to continue? Optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke. If it’s a good thing, they tend to think it’s permanent. The opposite holds true for the pessimist: Good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur. – is what happened likely to continue? Optimists think that if it’s a bad thing it’s a fluke. If it’s a good thing, they tend to think it’s permanent. The opposite holds true for the pessimist: Good things are the flukes and bad things are more likely to recur. Pervasiveness – Does it reflect your whole life? Is it “universal” or is it “specific”? With a good event, the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life. With a bad event, she will tend to isolate the incident as specific to that situation. The opposite holds true for the pessimist. – Does it reflect your whole life? Is it “universal” or is it “specific”? With a good event, the optimist is more likely to extend it to her whole life.

An optimist pats himself on the back (internal), thinking he did a good job. If the same thing happens to a pessimist, he is more likely to attribute the success to luck, other people’s hard work, or something else outside of his control (external). How we interpret events can maximise happiness and energize us, or make us feel terrible. And the good news is: it’s in our power to decide. It is an emotional intelligence skill that can be developed. Of course, many situations in life call for a dose of pessimism, caution, and “defensive thinking”, so our optimism should not blind us either. Like anything in excess, irrational optimism is also harmful – though arguably less harmful than irrational pessimism. So maybe this section should be called “choosing balanced optimism”. True optimism is more a reaction to the present than an expectation about the future. It is not about blindly believing that things will always turn out he best. That violates the principle of managing your expectations (see point 12). True optimism is about choosing to interpret events in a positive light when they do happen. And not being attached to past negative talk. It is being open that anything can happen, yet at the same time confident that “I can do something positive with anything that comes”. There are several studies on how being optimistic positively affects physical and mental health (1, 2), romantic relationships, athletic performance, career, business and the economy. Check out this article to read more on optimism & positive psychology, and this one about how happiness is also a deliberate choice. Action step: Identify three places in your life you are having negative self-talk. How could you have a more empowering interpretation of that situation? Is the negative self-talk based on reality now, or mere learned habit? 18. Be wrong Needing to be right all the time can be extremely limiting and energy consuming. Having the courage to be vulnerable and accept one’s mistakes is liberating. Whether you accept it not, reality is that many times you will be wrong. By saying, “I was wrong” more often – to yourself and others – you will find more compassion, humility and flexibility. People will trust you more. It is good to always aim for the highest – as long as we understand that perfection is unattainable, both in work and in relationships. Nothing is perfect; even the earth is not perfectly round. You will invariably make bad decisions. Understanding how often we are wrong makes us be more compassionate towards ourselves. We see that many times we simply did the best we could at that time – we need is to educate ourselves, not punish ourselves. We will also tend to criticise others less, and be more empathetic, which will improve our social relations. Humility pays off. Personally, it was not easy for me to accept and practice this lesson.

But once I tried a few times, I started taking pleasure in it. There is a certain unburdening of the heart that happens, which makes it worth it even if only for that feeling. My values and points of view were changing by time, even to something opposite, and I saw that contradicting myself was a sign of growth, not confusion or unreliability. Action step: Is it hard for you to accept being wrong? If so, try this: look back and see some opinion you had that you now see was wrong. Or maybe some bad decision. Then clearly express that you were wrong to a person involved in that situation. Depending on the magnitude of what happened, this “little” act can save a relationship, a company, a life. 19. Have some trust One of the qualities of developing your spirituality is the trust on something larger than yourself. Call it God, the Universe, Dharma, Life – doesn’t matter. It’s not about a whimsical expectation that things will happen according to your preference, but a faith that things will happen in favor of your greater good. It’s a conviction that, if you put your best foot forward, the universe will respond. Does one really need trust? No. But life is more beautiful with it. Trust in something larger accomplishes four important things: makes you optimistic (section 17) decreases your worries and doubts, allowing you to forget about the future and focus more on the present forces you to accept things you cannot change takes you out of your little world you are less prone to mental masturbation of “what if…” There is also scientific evidence that trust makes us happy. And here is a podcast episode where one of my guests speaks about the value of surrender. Action step: Is it time to take a leap of faith somewhere in your life? How would your feelings and actions be different if you had more trust? 20. Dare to disagree “It’s always better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t” Marc and Angel Chernoff. Free yourself from the crowd mentality. Be a lion. You will not find happiness in the life of a sheep – at most comfort. The lion finds his own path, or carves one out if none is found. The sheep follows the beaten road. The lion walks alone if needed, and is fearless. The sheep is fearful and moves in herds. The lion roars loud and clear. The sheep’s sound is weak and hesitant. The lion rests deep, confident he can handle any challenge. The sheep is worried about tomorrow. The lion makes the news. The sheep reads the news. The lion creates and innovates.

Awaken the lion within. 21. Money matters, but not really What can money do for you, and how much of it do you really need? It’s a huge topic. But for the purposes of this post we can say there are broadly three types of attitudes when it comes to money: It’s not important (and other limiting beliefs) It’s extremely important and the reason of my efforts Money is a resource, and its important for my life, but it’s not a measure of success or happiness The first two will make you make you suffer. The balanced point of view will set you in the right path. There is plenty of research concluding that money does matter, but that once a certain threshold of comfort is achieved (some studies suggest 60~70k a year), it matters less and less to the overall wellbeing of the person. After the basic needs of life of oneself and one’s family are met, to continue to chase money is more a cause of dissatisfaction than fulfillment (refer to point number 6 of this post), especially if driven by peer comparison pressure and consumerism. The most valuable thing money can buy is time, and it is how you use your time that will determine how happy you are. Once the point of comfort has been reached, feeling happy with what we have, and focusing our efforts on life’s intrinsic values, seems to be the best use of money. Also, experiments show that spending it on others can boost our happiness more than spending it on ourselves (see also GreaterGood and ScienceMag). Action step: Discover what is your attitude about money. Are you holding any limiting beliefs, or over-focused on accumulating wealth? 22. Do your inner work All of these insights have one thing in common: they require some inner work. These keys are worthless unless you actually use them. You will need to put in some thought about yourself and your life, develop more self-awareness, and then decide to make a change. Most people are not taking this path – they are simply looking for patches. Solve one problem at its root and you will never need to solve it again. If you keep coming back to the same problems, on the same level, then maybe something is not right. No shortcuts here. No silver bullet. Just the pains of personal growth – like giving birth to your new self. Designed by you! The results pay off big time. The secret here is to fall in love with the process of growth. With the feeling of freeing oneself from old shackles. Enjoying the virtues we are developing. Action step: Create some space in your life for self-awareness and personal development. Nothing will make a bigger impact than this investment in yourself. Think", "_diversity_score": 9.90990990990991}

Institutions which hold a ‘yellow light speech code rating’ are defined as ones that have “at least one ambiguous policy that too easily encourages administrative abuse and arbitrary application.” The University of Alabama has three policies that egregiously violate students’ First Amendment rights. Those policies deal with university space, event advertisement, and event planning. Students can only use university space if an event is “in accordance with the priorities of the designated area.” Alabama also restricts where students can pass out advertisements for an approved event and the administration requires all advertisements to be in “good taste.” The administration makes final rulings on what qualifies as good taste. “Things like ground use restrictions really damage the ability of students to share ideas freely and openly,” Zach Warren, president of the University of Alabama’s Young Americans for Liberty chapter, told Red Alert Politics. “On our campus any hand outs must be approved so when we hand out pocket constitutions those technically have to be submitted weeks in advance for approval.” These policies allow for administrative overreach and enable the administration to ignore students’ rights to free expression on campus. Another example of a yellow light policy is Alabama’s event planning policy, which requires students to submit an “Online Event Planning Form” seven to ten business days before an event. An event that requires such steps include 5Ks, parades, and demonstrations or marches. In the university’s opinion, these policies are designed to avoid scheduling conflicts and to allocate resources effectively. Taylor Bryant, University of Alabama’s director of communications, told Red Alert Politics in an email that these policies supposedly help “ensure the safety of our students and campus community and offers all campus-affiliated parties the same opportunities without disrupting the University’s ability to provide its essential services of teaching and learning.” “Our grounds use permit policy allows campus affiliates to request the space that meets their needs and helps University staff coordinate appropriate campus resources (security, grounds keeping, etc.) and avoid scheduling conflicts,” Bryant stated. These policies have been abused by UA in the past as seen in October 2016 when UA imposed a $7,000 security fee on the UA College Republicans chapter for bringing Milo Yiannopoulos to campus. After initially expecting a fee of $1,000, UA continually increased the amount of the required security fee as the event drew near. Only after experiencing significant pushback from students did the university rescind the fee and allow the event to go on as planned. “While policies like those at University Alabama are not unique, what makes them especially egregious are the layers upon layers of red tape that the university puts on students to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Alexander Staudt, Director of Free Speech at Young Americans for Liberty. “Whether it is restricting space-use based on the priorities of that area or requiring a ‘good taste’ stamp of approval from administration for advertisements, these policies are unconstitutional. Public universities, such as UA, are obligated to maximize the breadth and availability of speech, ideas, and knowledge.” Tyler Cochran studies Political Science and Religion at Missouri State University.

Its most recent misstep occurred this week when its social media team tweeted this misleading headline: \"Fact check: No, the Clintons were not paid millions by Russia.\" The accompanying article proves nothing of the sort. The supposed fact check comes in response to a tweet this week from President Trump that read, \"Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation.\" .@foxandfriends \"Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation\"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 19, 2017 He is not wrong, and the Newsweek article acknowledges as much. It acknowledges that former President Bill Clinton received a generous $500,000 speaking fee in 2010 from a Kremlin-linked bank with ties to Uranium One, a Canadian uranium company that had mines in the U.S. The Newsweek article also acknowledges a separate New York Times report that showed Uranium One's chairman donated approximately $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation in four separate installments as his company was being acquired by a Russian nuclear energy firm called Rosatom. There's more from the Times report, and none of it reflects well on the Clintons: As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One's chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. The only thing the Newsweek fact check disputes is whether the millions paid had anything to do with Rosatom's successful efforts to secure approval from the State Department to acquire Uranium One. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment gave the go-ahead in October 2010, handing the Russian state-owned nuclear agency control of 20 percent of the uranium in America. It's unclear whether the Russian cash given to the Clinton Foundation had anything to do with Bill Clinton's attempts in 2010 to facilitate meetings with Rosatom executives. It's also unclear whether the payments had anything to do with his decision to meet privately with Russian President Vladimir Putin that same year. But this is still a long way off from, \"Fact check: No, the Clintons were not paid millions by Russia.\" Aggravatingly enough, the headline that appears on Newsweek's website is evenhanded and reasonable. It reads simply, \"Did Russia Send Money to Bill Clinton's foundation like Trump says? Fact-checking the president's claim.\" It's the social media version of this headline that's atrocious. That said, like the tweeted headline, the body of the fact check also makes claims that it can't quite back, including, \"president is stretching the truth about the Clinton Foundation and money it received.\" Well, perhaps. But the Clinton Foundation did take in millions from the Russians. That's what the president tweeted. Here's how the Newsweek fact check concludes, \"Yes, the foundation received money and Bill Clinton was paid to give a speech, but there's no evidence the Clintons were paid by Russians to push through the uranium deal.\" This is correct, and it'd probably be devastating were it a thing the president actually said.

So it’s interesting when the paper reports from London that “antibanking sentiment here is still off the charts,” leaving the industry “gun shy about flaunting wealth.” That was also true at the Olympics, even though “The games are typically one of the biggest corporate schmoozefests on the calendar.” This is part of what the Journal calls “a wave of banker austerity,” with executives skipping the usual “hired black sedan” and champagne, and even resorting to putting up important clients in mere three- or four-star hotels. Overall, “The City of London’s high-rolling banking industry is rolling as low as possible,” in order to “avoid displays of wealth that will further inflame an already angry public.” So why is the public so “inflamed” with “antibanking sentiment?” Recent events here and in the UK make it easy to see. 1. Fool me 30 Times, Shame on You For Britons, at the top of the list stands the LIBOR rate-fixing scandal, in which the UK’s most prominent banks conspired to fix a baseline interest rate that's used to calculate rates on thousands of financial products like mortgages. The scandal continues to unfold, with giants Citigroup and Chase still awaiting charges, among others. But as is common in episodes where major banks have committed large-scale fraud, in this case involving hundreds of billions of dollars in financial instruments, the most heavily implicated bank, Barclay’s, is not facing legal prosecution, merely a large fine. The New York Times Dealbook described the settlement as “a multimillion dollar financial penalty and modest admission of wrongdoing, but no criminal conviction to affect its operation.” Pretty gentle treatment for a firm whose traders, while working to manipulate the key rate, said in emails while executing the collusion: “Always happy to help;” “For you, anything;” “Done…for you big boy;” and from a more conscientious employee, “I will reluctantly, gradually, and artificially get my libors in line.” Especially notable in this connection is the conspicuous absence of Bob Diamond, the disgraced ex-CEO of Barclay’s, from the London Games, since Diamond “had been a fixture for years at UK events” and “had been planning to attend several Olympic events as a guest…[but] after the furor surrounding his resignation, he is expected to stay away.” The banks are politically smart enough to keep their heads down when they look bad. Of course, the LIBOR affair pales in its human impact when compared with other recent banking scandals, like the “robo-signing” scandal in the US. In that scam, thousands of homes, mortgaged during the housing bubbles, were foreclosed upon without the required legal standing or paperwork. The implicated banks, including the four US megabanks—Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo—settled the charges with the Justice Department and the states for $26 billion, an impressive figure. However, the settlement does little for the real human families evicted fraudulently, including three-quarters of a million evictees who were foreclosed upon from the finance crisis through the end of 2011, most of whom received a check for", "_diversity_score": 14.833215046132008}

However, the settlement does little for the real human families evicted fraudulently, including three-quarters of a million evictees who were foreclosed upon from the finance crisis through the end of 2011, most of whom received a check for $2000 each. 2. Sanctions-Busters In the fast-moving world of banking scandals, Standard Chartered of London impressively secured a spot for itself when it was accused by a New York regulator of laundering a quarter trillion dollars in Iranian money, in violation of US economic sanctions on the country. You don’t have to support the efforts of the US government to economically strangle Iran to appreciate the disregard for law in company emails cited in the criminal charge, including an executive confiding that the Iranian trading had “the potential to cause very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage to the group.” Standard Chartered settled the charges for $334 million, in hopes it can “avoid admitting wrongdoing.” Indeed, this type of fraud is increasingly prevalent among the financial sector, with banking giant HSBC accused of laundering Mexican drug cartel money, along with cash from Saudi banks with terrorism ties. ING Bank recently spent millions settling a charge that it also bucked international sanctions to move Cuban and Iranian money. These above-the-law moves, while possibly helping the peoples of these countries against the suffocation of their economies by the US, no doubt add to the “inflamed” feelings of the general public. 3. One Nation Under fraud The power of the financial sector is such that the SEC, whose job is to examine financial firms and prevent or punish fraud, has become notorious for avoiding punishing firms for lying, even when dealing with repeat offenders. While financial law allows serious penalties for fraud, including large fines and restrictions on business practices, the SEC allows “waivers” for these offenses and has granted them quite liberally to the largest US banks. Chase has settled six fraud cases since 2000, with settlements that run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, but has argued before the SEC that it has “a strong record of compliance with securities laws.” Notably, the SEC justifies settling these cases and issuing waivers by referring to promises from the firms not to violate the law in the future. Yet when the firms are taken back to court for their next act of fraud, their recidivism rarely brings a stiffer penalty, as any mere human would likely receive. In fact, of these waivers issued by the regulator, nearly half go to repeat offenders, “Wall Street firms that had settled previous fraud charges by agreeing never again to violate the very laws that the SEC was now saying that they had broken.” This includes other industry giants like Bank of America and also Citigroup, which racked up so much fraud it finally did get sanctioned. The ability of the megabanks to weasel out of sanctions for widespread fraud are a third reason industry’s keen to stay below the radar. 4.

High-Speed Glitches Further undermining confidence in our financial cornerstones are the recurrent “glitches” in large computerized stock trading systems that have lead to horrifying market swings. May 2010 saw the stock exchange lose literally trillions of dollars of value in just several minutes, only to recover again within another 20 minutes. August of this year began with a similar out-of-control development on the market, as retail trading company Knight Capital Group had a “technology issue” with its brand-new automated stock-trading system. While it was supposed to react to trading by others, the computer system instead placed giant orders to the point that millions of erroneous trades were made, often at inflated prices, such that Knight ended up having to seek new equity partners to stay afloat. Computer algorithm-based trading strategieslike those used by Knight are another product of regulatory loosening over the last two decades, to the point that half of stock trading is now handled by such “high-speed” firms. To compensate for the increased instability such deregulation has brought about, the Securities and Exchange Commission maintains “circuit breakers” to cut off trading if the price of a particular stock behaves erratically. Unfortunately, these countermeasures are not activated until 15 minutes after the beginning of trading, whereas Knight’s algorithm began runaway trading immediately. The upshot of course is to make finance in general and equity trading in particular more suspiciously viewed by the public. As the Times put it, the chaotic computer trading was “the latest black eye for the financial markets…drawing renewed attention to the fragility and instability of the nation’s stock markets.” 5. Fed by the Fed Notably, the banks are increasingly dependent on government action for their profits. In recent years, the central bank of the EU and the US Federal Reserve have engaged in a somewhat desperate mode of economic stimulus, “quantitative easing,” where the Fed buys bonds from major banks in order to inject more cash into the banking system, with the goal of lowering interest rates and hopefully increasing economic growth. This bond buying has become a significant profit center for the banking majors, with bond-trading income exploding shortly after each round of (mostly ineffective) monetary “stimulus.” The business press notes that “Big trading banks are particularly well positioned to profit when central banks act aggressively. The firms help make markets in bonds and derivatives. When the banks’ clients see the Fed take bold steps, they feel encouraged and come off the sidelines to buy more bonds. This increases the amount of business that flows through Wall Street, but it also lifts the prices of the bonds that banks hold, creating profits for the traders.” The ability of the banking industry to sustain its profitability and power despite scandal after scandal – and after crisis after technological disaster -- speaks to its unparalleled power in the modern economy. But beside the social power of the firms to dominate markets and shape perceptions with ad spending, and their obvious political muscle, the banks also make use of their power in a more everyday fashion, in maintaining relatively high retail interest rates in the US.

But beside the social power of the firms to dominate markets and shape perceptions with ad spending, and their obvious political muscle, the banks also make use of their power in a more everyday fashion, in maintaining relatively high retail interest rates in the US. The mortgage-handling banks are benefiting in historically large terms from the growing spread between the low rates they pay to investors they sell mortgages to, and the higher rates they charge the actual homeowner. The Times business section notes that “if the market were functioning properly, the recent drop in the bond rates should have led to a larger decline in mortgage rates for consumers than has actually occurred. Instead, the difference between the two rates is increasing.” One suggested reason: “Mortgage lenders may also be benefiting from less competition. The upheaval of the financial crisis of 2008 has led to the concentration of mortgage lending in the hands of a few big banks, primarily Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and US Bancorp.” This long record suggests why the finance industry is trying to keep a low profile these days.

The process already taking shape in the world of consolidating «larger spaces», and the return of the empires of by-gone eras may not, at first glance, seem to respond to the spirit of the times. However, we are living in an age which, in view of its uncertainty in people's minds, is indiscriminate to such an extent that it is no stranger to the most improbable policy prescriptions. The world is in a state of interregnum in which, as Zygmunt Bauman says, «change is the only constant, and the unknown - the only certainty»; in this world, Europe remains a battlefield, but nowadays the battle is between a Westphalian model of sovereign states and new forms of supranational governance… Traditional European empires of modern times, which is to say the modern age, have risen up on the ruins of feudalism. However, it is a peculiarity of postmodernism that it is ready, on a fairly eclectic basis, to take on the organisational forms of political relations of any era. Piracy, which was once from times of old (remember the famous Algerian pirates) is today once again firmly establishing itself along the shores of Africa; a by-effect, of course, but it has become indicative of a time in which the archaic and the modern intermingle in the most unimaginable way possible. This is nothing new, however. Similar era breakdowns have taken place time and again. The Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, in his work written between the two world wars entitled «The New Middle Ages», wrote: «We are destined to live in a historical time of era change». Berdyaev referred to this time as «the end of new history and the beginning of a new Middle Ages», defining it as a transition from the rationalism of new history to the irrationalism of a medieval type... «The spiritual beginnings of past history are being eliminated, its spiritual power exhausted... All the usual categories of thought and form of life of the most «advanced», «progressive», even «revolutionary» people of the 19th and 20th centuries are hopelessly outdated and have lost all meaning for the present and especially for the future». According to Berdyaev's observations, the transition to a new middle ages, just the same as the previous transition to an «old» middle ages, is accompanied by a noticeable expansion of old societies and the indiscernible addition of new ones. «Individualism has eliminated all of its possibilities in new history, there is no longer any energy left in it...

Is there much that is real about the growth of insatiable demands?» The Russian philosopher noted that Christianity had previously played a unifying role for at least a substantial proportion of mankind. Its very existence «signified an escape from pagan nationalism and particularism». At the end of new history, «we are once again seeing before us an unfettered world of pagan particularism, inside which there is a deadly battle and destruction taking place». However, many of Berdyaev's ideas do not seem to be so pertinent these days; it would obviously be wrong to place an equals sign between the time in which he wrote and the beginning of the 21st century. Although the turns of the historical spiral are linked with each other, each one is also unique, and since the New Middle Ages has already taken place, then in imitation of Berdyaev it might be possible to call the trend of our times the Newest Middle Ages. One of the most noticeable features of this period, for example, is the emergence of various complex networks, and not just networks of an information-technology and sociological nature, but also those encompassing relations between states. Strategies for using network warfare to control nations are extremely popular in Washington. The Pentagon, in particular, has officially adopted a new military doctrine of net-centric warfare aimed at «superior knowledge» and «information dominance». (1) At the same time, our internationally-networked world with its apparent independence of individual centres of power which are, in fact, incorporated into more complex hierarchical relations and interdependencies surprisingly reminds one, in an ontological sense, of the world of the Middle Ages. In particular, a system of multilayered vassalage is forming before our very eyes in which there will no longer be a supreme «liege lord» as before (because he cannot and does not want to do it), interfering in literally everything to do with the rulers in his area of dominance on the principle of «A vassal of my vassal is not my vassal». Washington understands that it is both financially and physically impossible to delve into the particulars of all 200 world powers, but that is exactly what they have been trying to do there so far and with increasing amounts of effort. It is simpler to choose half a dozen or a dozen trusted agents («vassals») and entrust/trust them to do it, controlling them themselves. This is why some of the recent actions of America's close allies, first and foremost France, are so similar to the principle of distributing feudal lands. It is probably possible to talk about a plan for a kind of super empire in place of a sole super power which, on the basis of the network principle, would be subordinate to the regional or traditional empires currently acquiring a new lease of life. The centre would be the same, but now it would be more like a coordinator than a straight omnipresent steward; it would be considerably more economical and consequently, or so the Americans are", "_diversity_score": 13.850231941683234}

The centre would be the same, but now it would be more like a coordinator than a straight omnipresent steward; it would be considerably more economical and consequently, or so the Americans are hoping, no less efficient. Full sovereignty, meanwhile, including the right to military intervention, would undoubtedly be centred at the top of this pyramid. As the well-known American academic Noam Chomsky writes, the principles of international order lie in the fact that the United States has the right to use violence whenever they like. And nobody else has that right . «Of course not. Well, maybe our clients do. So they inherit the right. Other American clients do, too. But the rights really reside in Washington. That's what it means to own the world. It's like the air you breathe. You can't question it». (2) In fact today, on a new turn of history, a neofeudal system of vassal dependence is re-establishing itself in the world which, in its day, replaced the mighty Rome. Today's Rome is Washington, which in many ways is in exactly the same state of imperial exhaustion, including moral, and which in reality is trying to continue its hegemony using exactly the same methods, although with the very latest technology; but really it makes no different, it is only technique and there is nothing new in that. Neo-vassalage has a lot of benefits. Firstly, if something is going wrong, it is always possible to make it seem like the one responsible is not who is really pulling the strings, namely Washington, but the vassal state. Using this vassal, it is completely possible to deny one's own involvement in the fates of other states and pull on the robes of impartial arbitrator. Secondly, such a mechanism for projecting global power also allows for the costs of managing territories to be kept to a minimum, which is rather important given the global financial crisis. At the same time, while setting about reorganising the world, Washington also needs to factor in the costs that this would bring. At some point, the interests of the main liege lord may not coincide with the interests of large vassals capable of obstinacy. Furthermore, those against whom this game is being directed may be in a position to set about strengthening their own alliances, the contours of which are already discernible. Consequently, while on the way to putting its plan into action, Washington still has a number of complex problems to solve. (To be continued) (1) Burgess, Kennet J.

Tomorrow’s hearing has three panelists listed: Leonard Chanin, Of Counsel at Morrison and Foerster – a law firm that was a registered lobbyist for the American Bankers Association last year according to the Center for Responsive Politics; David Hirschmann, another registered lobbyist and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent $62 million lobbying Congress since 1998 in an effort to gut or water down regulations of Wall Street and other big corporate groups. (For a more in-depth understanding of what drives the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, not to be confused with the small business organization in your community known as the Chamber of Commerce, read Susan Antilla’s “Chamber of Commerce Gives Wall Street, Polluters What They Pay For.”) Rounding out tomorrow’s panel is Todd Zywicki, a senior scholar at the rabidly anti-regulatory Mercatus Center and a Law Professor at the related George Mason University. According to SourceWatch, the Mercatus Center “was founded and is funded by the Koch Family Foundations,” the nonprofits set up by the Koch brothers to sluice money into a sprawling maze of think tanks, corporate front groups, and university economic departments. SourceWatch reveals that “the Koch family has contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus Center.” One of the luminaries of Mercatus Center fame is Wendy Lee Gramm, whom the Mercatus Center archives credits with setting up its “Regulatory Studies Program” in 1999. Gramm was also the former Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 1988 to January 1993, which took a hands off approach to regulating derivatives: According to a report from Public Citizen: “In 1992, as the first step in its business plan to profit on the speculation of energy, Enron petitioned the CFTC to make regulatory changes that would limit the scope of the commission’s authority over certain kinds of futures contracts. Immediately before leaving the CFTC, Gramm muscled through approval of an unusual draft regulation that would do just that – it narrowed the definition of futures contracts and excluded Enron’s energy future contracts and swaps from regulatory oversight. Although her actions were criticized by government officials who feared the change would have severe negative consequences (as, in fact, it did), Gramm was rewarded five weeks after she left the CFTC with a lucrative appointment to Enron’s Board of Directors.

Between 1993 and 2001, when the company declared bankruptcy, Enron paid Gramm between $915,000 and $1.85 million in salary, attendance fees, stock option sales, and dividends.” Enron was a major campaign contributor to Wendy Lee Gramm’s husband, former Senator Phil Gramm, for whom the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is partially named. Gramm-Leach-Bliley is the legislation signed into law in 1999 that overturned the seminal consumer protection legislation against bank abuses known as the Glass-Steagall Act. It allowed the gambling casinos of Wall Street (investment banks and brokerage firms) to merge with commercial banks holding FDIC-insured deposits of savers and to use those insured deposits to gamble for the house in unregulated derivatives. (See here and here for how that’s worked out.) What was the Koch brothers’ interest in deregulating derivatives? Unknown to most Americans, in addition to its oil, chemical and lumber interests, Koch Industries has a sprawling futures trading operation known as Koch Supply & Trading. The Koch web site defines the operation thusly: “Building on four decades of trading experience, our capabilities are rooted in energy products. Our Metals and Derivatives Trading groups have also expanded beyond trading, logistics and operations to pioneer the use of risk-management tools. Each of our team members has a role in exchanging some of the world’s most valued commodities.” With offices in financial hubs around the world (London, Geneva, Amsterdam, Singapore, Dubai) Koch Supply & Trading is also offering, through its New York office, “energy and metals risk management products to corporate clients and financial institutions.” Koch also says its New York office focuses on “trading financial instruments across multiple asset classes, including commodities, fixed income and foreign exchange.” In 2014, Tim Dickinson took an in-depth look for Rolling Stone Magazine into the “Toxic Empire” of the Koch Brothers, including Koch Supply & Trading. Dickinson reports: “Like a casino that bets at its own craps table, Koch engages in ‘proprietary trading’ – speculating for the company’s own bottom line. ‘We’re like a hedge fund and a dealer at the same time,’ bragged Ilia Bouchouev, head of Koch’s derivatives trading in 2004. ‘We can both make markets and speculate.’ The company’s many tentacles in the physical oil business give Koch rich insight into market conditions and disruptions that can inform its speculative bets. When oil prices spiked to record heights in 2008, Koch was a major player in the speculative markets, according to documents leaked by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with trading volumes rivaling Wall Street giants like Citibank.

And contrary to the values of an open society that both the United States and Great Britain and most of the advanced world adheres to. I don't want to live in a world in which the state is making decisions as to who says what.\" Obama is absolutely correct. Moreover, his words represent a subtle but much-needed rebuke to the growing chorus of Western voices who want more regulation of speech. These individuals are rendered by the usual suspects: Judith Butler, the LGBTQ-Gestapo, the art critic Taliban, the \"speech is violence\" crew, but also by otherwise democratic governments. The British government, for example, wants Twitter to ban speakers who do not intend to but might upset certain audiences. Indeed, Germany is already taking aggressive legal action to enforce social media compliance with authoritarian speech laws. And here at home on campuses and in political debates, it's clear the liberal intelligentsia wants to redefine the broad speech protections afforded under the First Amendment. Unfortunately, it's not simply the Left that bears culpability here. As he has frequently tweeted out, President Trump wants to limit free speech protections for the media. Such arguments must not meet our silence. Ultimately, if we value freedom, the right to live in a society in which individuals are free to air their grievances and participate in public debates, we must give preference to the right to use one's mouth over the right to shield one's ears. That divergence makes America exceptional, but as 2018 approaches, it is under increasing threat.

He wrote a new book. It’s called Plunder and Deceit: Big Government’s Exploitation of Young People and the Future. As an investigative author, I spend my time combing through troves of data, reams of financial transactions, and stacks of inter-governmental communiqués, all in an effort to unearth fact-patterns of self-dealing and cronyism, malfeasance and graft. My work is zoomed in, specific, granular. The conservative movement needs its sleuths. But what I love about Levin’s Plunder and Deceit is its philosophical breadth and panoramic sweep. Powered by intellectual titans like Edmund Burke, Alexis de Tocqueville, and James Madison, Levin urges young people to embark upon the creation of a “New Civil Rights movement,” one that snaps the manacles of statist power and embraces an intellectual and economic freedom that excites and animates the moral imagination. Best of all, Levin respects young readers enough to shoot straight with them: the road to serfdom is breezy; the march to liberty painstaking. Yet, as he reminds us, the fruits of the latter far eclipse the former. “It is the nature of younger people today to passively live and let live and conform to their second-class standing; or worse, if inspired, to unite around distractive or self-destructive causes,” writes Levin. “But the right cause now is nothing short of self-preservation. And there can be no doubt that the New Civil Rights movement and new generation of activists, which must challenge the tyranny of the status quo, will be met with entrenched resistance, resulting in unease, discomfiture, risk, and ridicule. This is a small price to pay for freedom and justice.” Amen! With the Constitution always as his guide, Levin explains to “the rising generation” why the nation’s founding bedrock document is precious and rare. As President Ronald Reagan put it, in the constitutions of most governments, “the government tells the people of those countries what they’re allowed to do. In our Constitution, ‘We the People’ tell the government what it can do.” That’s a difference worth fighting for and protecting. Levin’s book shows us how. Authentic, sagacious, and written in a philosophical tenor that sometimes soars to operatic heights, Plunder and Deceit is an important work to be read by all and bequeathed to America’s rising generation.", "_diversity_score": 67.63754045307444}

American A-10 and C-130 warplanes targeted a group of about 300 trucks near Abu Kamal, in Syria. Given that the Islamic State is thought to have just over 1,000 trucks in its entire fleet, the group of 300 represented a huge target for U.S. planes. At a Pentagon news conference last Wednesday, reporters wanted to know why American forces did not take out more than 116 trucks. Why not all 300, or something close to that? A U.S. official said the American attackers simply ran out of ammunition. \"There were 300, I think, to begin with, and then you hit 116. Why didn't you go back?\" a reporter asked Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Steve Warren. \"Frankly, the aircraft expended 24 500-pound bombs, and all of their ammunition,\" Warren answered. \"So they — they shot everything they had and then they had to go home.\" Journalists had another question: If oil is vitally important to the Islamic State, why didn't the U.S. hit the tanker trucks long ago, given that the American anti-ISIS operation began in September 2014? \"If it's so important to cut off the oil shipments, the critical revenue source for ISIS, why did it take so long to take out 116 oil tanker trucks?\" a reporter asked. Warren explained that American officials were deeply worried about harming the truck drivers, who were working for the Islamic State but might not be ISIS themselves. U.S. officials settled on a plan to drop leaflets on the trucks about 45 minutes before the raid, warning the drivers that an attack was coming, while U.S. pilots flew low passes over the area. Planning all that took time. \"This is our first strike against tanker trucks,\" Warren said. \"We have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation. What we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective. We would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired.\" Warren said U.S. officials conducted a study and decided to focus on the Islamic State's oil distribution network — trucks. But the problem was the drivers. \"We have not struck these trucks before,\" Warren said. \"We assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support ISIL, the truck drivers, themselves, [are] probably not members of ISIL; they're probably just civilians. So we had to figure out a way around that. We're not in this business to kill civilians, we're in this business to stop ISIL — to defeat ISIL.\" American officials decided on the leaflet-and-buzz plan. \"We spent some time developing ... the leaflets, the low pass,\" Warren said. \"We did some ... some strafe runs as well — to kind of shoo people away without harming them. So we had to go through that whole process of one, determining whether or not we felt it was in our best interest to strike these trucks. And then once we determined that, yes, it is in our interest to strike these trucks, how do we go about ensuring that we're able to mitigate the potential of civilian casualties?

And these things take time.\" Finally, when all the work had been done, 300 Islamic State trucks were found in one place. It was an inviting target. \"These trucks were queued up,\" Warren said. \"They were sitting sort of on flat desert. There wasn't really anything recognizable as a road around. It was just out there on the desert floor in the vicinity of one of these oil fields, one of these oil facilities that we've been striking. So they were queued up there waiting to take on their illicit oil. ... So these trucks were — they were just sitting there, not moving.\" It was an extraordinary opportunity to take out somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the Islamic State's entire truck fleet. And after destroying 116, the Americans ran out of ammunition. The remaining 184 trucks were not destroyed. Beyond the out-of-ammo problem, reporters raised the issue of the U.S. forces' extreme care in avoiding civilian casualties. If American forces won't hit any target if there is any fear that any non-ISIS person might be harmed, might that not prolong the time it takes to destroy the Islamic State, which is killing civilians right and left? \"Is there a Catch-22 about not striking civilians and avoiding civilian casualties when, over the past year, the $50 million in oil revenue generated has been going to killing a large number of civilians?\" a reporter asked. \"Is there any risk that avoiding civilian casualties is actually prolonging more civilian casualties?\" That was a very thoughtful question, Warren conceded, and an issue American war planners think about constantly. But Warren didn't have an answer. \"It's something that we wrestle with every day,\" he said.", "_diversity_score": 7.7150239940937615}

This medicine may be effective for that particular issue, but it may cause other problems down the line. The user might even get addicted to it, and not be able to stop taking it. This is why it is important to solve medical problems as naturally as possible. The same is true if you suffer from herniated discs in your back. Read on to find out some tips about the best way to relieve this pain naturally! What are Herniated Discs? When the vertebrae in your back are being cushioned by the surrounding spongy discs, it means that everything is functioning normally. These discs act as a shock absorber, and keep the vertebrae safe. However, they might become damaged, and therefore result in a herniated disc. This can be caused by advancing age or by injury to the spine. The person will start to experience pain or numbness in the area where the nerve is exposed. This is why it is important to always protect your back when you are engaging in risky activities. A herniated disc can be prevented from getting worse by adjusting a few lifestyle habits. What is the Best Way to Alleviate Pain? The best way to alleviate pain from a herniated disc is to purchase a proper mattress. There are thousands of different mattresses to choose from, but you need to get one that is specific to your issue. Hybrid mattresses are a good option to look at because they combine different variations of coil, foam, and other materials. The combination may be what it takes to find the perfect bed for you and your back. Memory foam could also be a good choice, because it offers a variety of benefits to the user. Memory Foam Mattresses If you lie on a memory foam mattress, the material will conform to your specific body type. You shape will be moulded onto the foam, and it will remain this way after you get up. This is a benefit to you because the foam is alleviating pressure from certain points in your body. It is spreading out the weight of your body so that the pressure points are dispersed. This reduces the amount of back pain you will feel, because it is not being pushed down on as you sleep. Memory foam has been known to improve the quality of sleep for people with back pain. They will not be woken up as often during the night, because they are not feeling sudden jolts of pain through their bodies.

Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Thursday. That was a rebuke of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who outlined Trump’s policy for Syria following the destruction of the Islamic State as a landholding terrorist organization. Tillerson explained that U.S. forces and diplomats must work to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and the domination of Syria by Iranian-backed terrorists. But Cardin maintained the new policy exceeds anything authorized by Congress. “I am extremely disappointed that the Trump administration announced a significant change in U.S. policy — the commitment of U.S. forces for an indefinite period of time in Syria — without first consulting Congress,” Cardin said. “The Trump administration lacks the authority to keep U.S. military forces in Syria after the defeat of ISIS.” Trump, like former President Barack Obama, has traced the legal authority for counter-ISIS operations back to the legislation that authorized military action action against al Qaeda in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. ISIS formed out of the remnants of al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq. Tillerson tied the new Syria policy to that legal basis by noting the potential for ISIS to rehabilitate itself in the absence of U.S. forces. “ISIS presently has one foot in the grave, and by maintaining an American military presence in Syria until the full and complete defeat of ISIS is achieved, it will soon have two,” he said. In Tillerson’s telling, such a complete victory — over ISIS or Iranian forces in the country — depends on the success of a broader effort to bring peace and stability to Syria. “Ungoverned spaces, especially in conflict zones, are breeding grounds for ISIS and other terrorist organizations,” he said. “U.S. disengagement from Syria would provide Iran the opportunity to further strengthen its position in Syria. As we have seen from Iran’s proxy wars and public announcements, Iran seeks dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of our ally, Israel. As a destabilized nation and one bordering Israel, Syria presents an opportunity that Iran is all too eager to exploit.” The unveiling of the plan could renew congressional interest in crafting a new legislation defining the president’s legal authority to conduct counter-terrorism operations. For years, lawmakers in both parties have struggled to agree on the details of a new authorization of the use of military force. “Congress has been unable to bridge the gap between those who see a new AUMF as primarily an opportunity to limit the president and those who believe constraining the commander in chief in wartime is unwise,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said during a recent hearing. Tillerson’s announcement is sure to spark a new round of debate on the policy, though. “The State and Defense Departments must immediately consult with the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which retains jurisdiction over the use of military force,” Cardin said.", "_diversity_score": 7.7150239940937615}

From the video Fox finally aired, the unedited one, it’s clear from his stance and his left arm being extended, that he hit that man. The other video from which the stills of the demonstrator swinging on Crowder, the one shot from the other angle, still hasn’t surfaced.

Again. Hannity said the incident represents “The ugly and twisted and dark soul of liberalism,” accused the left of “becoming increasingly vicious and violent” and said the “thugs” need to be “restrained” and “arrested.” He said, “Law and order has to prevail. If it doesn’t, this violence is going to spread, there will be blood in the streets and at some point, some people may, in fact, die. Now that’s the course we are currently on.”” Newshound Of course he seemed eager to use it to demonize the left. He’s smart enough to pick a side, the side that isn’t getting rounded up by our death squads in Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and others.

The Democratic and Republican parties have become little more than squalid clubs of privilege and wealth, whores to money and corporate interests, hostage to a massive arms industry, and so adept at deception and self-delusion they no longer know truth from lies. We will either find our way out of this mess by embracing an uncompromising democratic socialism—one that will insist on massive government relief and work programs, the nationalization of electricity and gas companies, a universal, not-for-profit government health care program, the outlawing of hedge funds, a radical reduction of our bloated military budget and an end to imperial wars—or we will continue to be fleeced and impoverished by our bankrupt elite and shackled and chained by our surveillance state. The free market and globalization, promised as the route to worldwide prosperity, have been exposed as a con game. But this does not mean our corporate masters will disappear. Totalitarianism, as George Orwell pointed out, is not so much an age of faith as an age of schizophrenia. “A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial,” Orwell wrote, “that is when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.” Force and fraud are all they have left. They will use both. There is a political shift in Europe toward an open confrontation with the corporate state. Germany has seen a surge of support for Die Linke (The Left), a political grouping formed 18 months ago. It is co-led by the veteran socialist “Red” Oskar Lafontaine, who has built his career on attacking big business. Two-thirds of Germans in public opinion polls say they agree with all or some of Die Linke’s platform. The Socialist Party of the Netherlands is on the verge of overtaking the Labor Party as the main opposition party on the left. Greece, beset with street protests and violence by disaffected youths, has seen the rapid rise of the Coalition of the Radical Left. In Spain and Norway socialists are in power. Resurgence is not universal, especially in France and Britain, but the shifts toward socialism are significant. Corporations have intruded into every facet of life. We eat corporate food. We buy corporate clothes. We drive corporate cars. We buy our vehicular fuel and our heating oil from corporations. We borrow from corporate banks. We invest our retirement savings with corporations. We are entertained, informed and branded by corporations. We work for corporations. The creation of a mercenary army, the privatization of public utilities and our disgusting for-profit health care system are all legacies of the corporate state. These corporations have no loyalty to America or the American worker. They are not tied to nation states. They are vampires. “By now the [commercial] revolution has deprived the mass of consumers of any independent access to the staples of life: clothing, shelter, food, even water,” Wendell Berry wrote in “The Unsettling of America.” “Air remains the only necessity that the average user can still get for himself, and the revolution had imposed a heavy tax on that by way of pollution.

They are vampires. “By now the [commercial] revolution has deprived the mass of consumers of any independent access to the staples of life: clothing, shelter, food, even water,” Wendell Berry wrote in “The Unsettling of America.” “Air remains the only necessity that the average user can still get for himself, and the revolution had imposed a heavy tax on that by way of pollution. Commercial conquest is far more thorough and final than military defeat.” The corporation is designed to make money without regard to human life, the social good or impact on the environment. Corporate laws impose a legal duty on corporate executives to make as much money as possible for shareholders, although many have moved on to fleece shareholders as well. In the 2003 documentary film “The Corporation” the management guru Peter Drucker says: “If you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibilities, fire him. Fast.” A corporation that attempts to engage in social responsibility, that tries to pay workers a decent wage with benefits, that invests its profits to protect the environment and limit pollution, that gives consumers fair deals, can be sued by shareholders. Robert Monks, the investment manager, says in the film: “The corporation is an externalizing machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing machine. There isn’t any question of malevolence or of will. The enterprise has within it, and the shark has within it, those characteristics that enable it to do that for which it was designed.” Ray Anderson, the CEO of Interface Corp., the world’s largest commercial carpet manufacturer, calls the corporation a “present day instrument of destruction” because of its compulsion to “externalize any cost that an unwary or uncaring public will allow it to externalize.” “The notion that we can take and take and take and take, waste and waste, without consequences, is driving the biosphere to destruction,” Anderson says. In short, the film, based on Joel Bakan’s book “The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power,” asserts that the corporation exhibits many of the traits found in people clinically defined as psychopaths. Psychologist Dr. Robert Hare lists in the film psychopathic traits and ties them to the behavior of corporations: callous unconcern for the feelings for others; incapacity to maintain enduring relationships; reckless disregard for the safety of others; deceitfulness: repeated lying and conning others for profit; incapacity to experience guilt; failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior. And yet, under the American legal system, corporations have the same legal rights as individuals. They give hundreds of millions of dollars to political candidates, fund the army of some 35,000 lobbyists in Washington and thousands more in state capitals to write corporate-friendly legislation, drain taxpayer funds and abolish government oversight. They saturate the airwaves, the Internet, newsprint and magazines with advertisements promoting their brands as the friendly face of the corporation. They have high-priced legal teams, millions of employees, skilled public relations firms and thousands of elected officials to ward off public intrusions into their affairs or halt messy lawsuits. They hold a near monopoly on all electronic and printed sources of information.

A few media giants—AOL-Time Warner, General Electric, Viacom, Disney and Rupert Murdoch’s NewsGroup—control nearly everything we read, see and hear. “Private capital tends to become concentrated in [a] few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of the smaller ones,” Albert Einstein wrote in 1949 in the Monthly Review in explaining why he was a socialist. “The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.” Labor and left-wing activists, especially university students and well-heeled liberals, have failed to unite. This division, which is often based on social rather than economic differences, has long stymied concerted action against ruling elites. It has fractured the American left and rendered it impotent. “Large sections of the middle class are being gradually proletarianized; but the important point is that they do not, at any rate not in the first generation, adopt a proletarian outlook,” Orwell wrote in 1937 during the last economic depression. “Here I am, for instance, with a bourgeois upbringing and a working-class income. Which class do I belong to? Economically I belong to the working class, but it is almost impossible for me to think of myself as anything but a member of the bourgeoisie. And supposing I had to take sides, whom should I side with, the upper class which is trying to squeeze me out of existence, or the working class whose manners are not my manners? It is probable that I, personally, in any important issue, would side with the working class. But what about the tens or hundreds of thousands of others who are in approximately the same position? And what about that far larger class, running into millions this time—the office-workers and black-coated employees of all kinds—whose traditions are less definite middle class but who would certainly not thank you if you called them proletarians? All of these people have the same interests and the same enemies as the working class. All are being robbed and bullied by the same system. Yet how many of them realize it? When the pinch came nearly all of them would side with their oppressors and against those who ought to be their allies.

This has yet to happen in the United States. The left never rallied in significant numbers behind Cynthia McKinney or Ralph Nader. In picking the lesser of two evils, it threw its lot in with a Democratic Party that backs our imperial wars, empowers the national security state and does the bidding of corporations. If Barack Obama does not end the flagrant theft of taxpayer funds by corporate slugs and the disgraceful abandonment of our working class, especially as foreclosures and unemployment mount, many in the country will turn in desperation to the far right embodied by groups such as Christian radicals. The failure by the left to offer a democratic socialist alternative will mean there will be, in the eyes of many embittered and struggling working- and middle-class Americans, no alternative but a perverted Christian fascism. The inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake.

Kevin, Andrew, and Luis Palau all stood together on Thursday to make the shocking announcement that beloved world-renowned evangelist Luis Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer. \"We wanted to tape this video to tell the whole world that love dad and the work that we do what's been going on in dad's life,\" Kevin, president of Luis Palau Ministries, said in the social media video posted Thursday. He then proceeded to share that his father fell ill after a busy fall season, as he returned from an overseas trip to the U.K. They believed he only had a chest cold but when it didn't go away the family convinced Luis to go to the doctor. \"To our surprise, the early report that we got just before Christmas [said] that there was some cancer inside one of dad's lungs,\" Kevin explained. They got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis. \"Just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,\" he continued. The son said they made the video so that people can join them in prayer. Luis then shared his heart concerning everything. \"I haven't been in a hospital one night except for when I broke a bone back in 1984 after missions from London,\" the esteemed Argentinian evangelist shared. \"To me, the first thing you do is cry. I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,\" Luis emotionally shared. \"This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror, if [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle medically speaking. Stage 4 is big time.\" He went on to say that the peace he felt immediately was that at least 10 years ago he elected his son, Kevin, to be president of the ministry and Andrew is an anointed evangelist. \"So everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next two months or two years, then I'm ready,\" the loving father maintained as his sons looked at him with heartbroken smiles. Luis said he's going to continue living one day at a time and despite the sad prognosis he still feels good. He shared the scripture that has been keeping him encouraged: Isaiah 41:10, which says, \"Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my victorious righteous right arm.\" \"I know the Lord is with me, by the Holy Spirit indwelling, He is with us, we go through it, we go into the presence of the lord,\" Luis testified. He also shared 2 Timothy 4 where the apostle Paul says, \"the time for my departure is here.\" The 83-year-old began to cry as he thought about leaving his family but he did say he still intends to complete the mission trips they have planned throughout the world for this year as", "_diversity_score": 34.31855500821018, "_bm25_score": 0.0, "_rank": 1, "_combined_score": 3.563175264445444, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.6565988181221274}

Andrew concluded the video by saying that he's had many restless nights the past couple of days. \"I got up and read my Proverbs early and couldn't wait to come up and see your face,\" he told his dad. He then quoted Proverbs 15, which says, \"The evidence of a happy heart is a cheerful face.\" \"To think that you're facing what you're facing and day by day we see your happy face, it's proof that you're at peace,\" Andrew stated. \"We beg you to pray for dad and mom,\" he asked viewers. Luis has been in ministry for more than 50 years. The Palau Association has collaborated with thousands of churches in hundreds of cities around the world in his life to this point. He's made an impact in top global cities: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, Moscow, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C., and more. This reporter was in attendance in 2015 as he rallied 1,000 New York City churches together to make history in the Big Apple. It was one of the biggest evangelical moves in New York City as approximately 60,000 people gathered to hear the Gospel and worship. The Palau Association has coordinated hundreds of citywide campaigns just like it in dozens of nations, including major evangelistic festivals on all five continents.

A team of scientists in California have found a new way to create stem cells that doesn't require the destruction of human embryos. Researchers at the San Francisco-based Gladstone Institute have announced that they were able to create stem cells by using skin cells from mice through a genome editing tool called CRISPR. Sheng Ding, PhD, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute, said in a statement released Monday that this was an innovative means of creating stem cells for research. \"This is a new way to make induced pluripotent stem cells that is fundamentally different from how they've been created before,\" said Ding. \"At the beginning of the study, we didn't think this would work, but we wanted to at least try to answer the question: can you reprogram a cell just by unlocking a specific location of the genome? And the answer is yes.\" In a statement, the Gladstone Institute noted that they were building upon the findings of senior investigator Shinya Yamanaka, MD, PhD, who in 2006 found that \"he could make stem cells — dubbed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) — by treating ordinary skin cells with four key proteins.\" \"Ding and others previously created iPSCs not with transcription factors, but by adding a cocktail of chemicals to the cells,\" noted the institute. \"The latest study, published in Cell Stem Cell, offers a third way to turn skin cells into stem cells by directly manipulating the cells' genome using CRISPR gene regulation techniques.\" Short for \"clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" CRISPRs are a type of DNA sequences found in bacteria. \"CRISPR technology was adapted from the natural defense mechanisms of bacteria and archaea (the domain of single-celled microorganisms). These organisms use CRISPR-derived RNA and various Cas proteins, including Cas9, to foil attacks by viruses and other foreign bodies,\" explained Live Science. \"They do so primarily by chopping up and destroying the DNA of a foreign invader. When these components are transferred into other, more complex, organisms, it allows for the manipulation of genes, or 'editing.'\" The Gladstone Institute's breakthrough on stem cell creation comes months after an Israeli-based firm developed a new ALS treatment that uses cells extracted from bone marrow rather than embryos. BrainStorm announced in October that it was beginning clinical treatments in the United States with the new treatment, which could help restore motor abilities for those with ALS. \"During the maturation process, the cells from the bone marrow are manipulated into behaving like brain cells, in that they produce materials that are the building blocks of the brain,\" reported The Jerusalem Post. \"When these modified cells are put back in patients, the building blocks circulate in the spinal fluid and help repair the damaged brain.\"", "_diversity_score": 34.31855500821018, "_bm25_score": 0.0, "_rank": 4, "_combined_score": 3.566490303917619, "_token_overlap": 0.0, "_length_score": 0.6731740154830024}
