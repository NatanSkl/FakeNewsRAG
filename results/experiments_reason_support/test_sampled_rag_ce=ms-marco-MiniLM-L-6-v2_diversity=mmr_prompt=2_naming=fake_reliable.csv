Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, connecting us with others and providing a platform for self-expression. However, beneath its seemingly harmless surface lies a complex web of habits that can have serious consequences.

One such habit is the tendency to overshare on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This can lead to unintended consequences, including job loss or even lawsuits. Employers may monitor employees' online activity, and posting inflammatory or discriminatory content can result in termination.

Another habit to avoid is stalking. Social media has made it easier for individuals to track others, often without their knowledge or consent. This can be particularly concerning for those who are already vulnerable, such as children or individuals with a history of abuse.

Moreover, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become breeding grounds for online harassment. Cyberbullying can take many forms, from subtle insults to full-blown threats. It's essential to maintain a healthy online presence and avoid engaging with trolls or bullies.

Furthermore, the rise of social media has also led to the proliferation of fake news and disinformation. This can have serious consequences, including influencing public opinion or even inciting violence.

To protect yourself from these risks, it's essential to be mindful of your online behavior. Here are a few tips:

* Be cautious when sharing personal information on social media.
* Manage your privacy settings to control who sees your content.
* Use secure and private internet connections to protect your data.
* Avoid engaging with trolls or bullies online.

By being aware of these habits and taking steps to avoid them, you can maintain a healthy online presence and avoid the risks associated with social media. Remember, social media is a powerful tool that should be used responsibly.","The Digital Landscape: A Complex Web of Influence

In recent years, the digital landscape has undergone significant transformations. Social media platforms have become integral to our daily lives, with billions of users worldwide. Twitter, once a hub for real-time discussions and news, has faced criticism over stagnant audience growth and its business value.

Meanwhile, Facebook's influence extends beyond its core platform. The company's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp has expanded its reach, while its live video broadcasting feature has become increasingly popular. However, concerns over fake news and the spread of misinformation have led to calls for greater regulation.

The rise of social media has also had a profound impact on how we consume journalism. Algorithms-driven feeds have fragmented our attention, making it harder to discover new content. News organizations are adapting by focusing on individual pieces rather than complete editions, while Facebook's algorithm prioritizes content that users are likely to engage with.

In the workplace, technology can be both a blessing and a curse. Employees often use their personal devices for work, which can lead to disengagement if not addressed. Companies like SAP are exploring ways to provide employees with similar capabilities, enabling new levels of engagement and individualized experiences.

As we navigate this complex digital landscape, it's essential to consider the role of media in times of unrest. Social media can be both a call to action and a distraction, spreading messages of protest and caution. In Egypt, for example, disruptions in cellphone coverage and internet access exacerbated the unrest, forcing citizens to engage with each other face-to-face.

As we move forward, it's crucial to strike a balance between technology and engagement. By understanding the impact of social media on our lives and the way we consume information, we can create a more informed and connected society.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

could tweeting about your job get you in trouble? (before it's news) one of the great things about social media is that you can use it to improve your chances of getting hired, and of growing your business network. social media can be a great tool for finding a new job, and you can keep your network of contacts up to date in the event that you find yourself in need of connections to help you climb the career ladder later on. however, even though social media has its advantages, the reality is that, sometimes, there are downsides. online privacy is becoming an oxymoron, and your employer — and even your former employer — may be monitoring your social media accounts for activity that could get your fired, or even sued. is your current job in jeopardy? in the last few years, you’ve probably heard stories about people getting fired from their jobs because of things they shared online. facebook images of teachers partying can be grounds for dismissal. blatantly discriminatory or inflammatory tweets can result in firing. even if you are posting on personal social media outlets, the reality is that many employers see you as a representative of their brand, even if you are technically “off duty.” the higher profile your job is, or the more people who associate you with a specific employer, the greater the consequences if you share something considered inappropriate online. it’s why teachers (who are considered role models) and company executives (who are considered the “faces” of their company brands) are often scrutin

Article 4 - open source urbanism
open source urbanism (before it's news) open source urbanism by domenico di siena summary /overview traditional medias don’t broadcast what the citizens are debating or organizing on a daily basis. nevertheless, thanks to social networks, people can receive information and interact in real time with others, taking part in debates and social movements; and the 15th of may in spain is an example of this. this new information ecosystem reduces the influence of the mass media and slowly forces local authorities to relate to citizens in a more direct and horizontal way. this is a great opportunity to generate a new “social control” model, pushing local authorities to take public opinion into account. the digital media offers a broad environment for communication so that the organisation of any given action is greatly improved; everything becomes decentralized while simultaneously connected and synchronized. on the urban scale, we speak of the “sentient city”, a model based on a technological/social ecosystem, where knowledge, collective actions, and interactions between individuals and groups are encouraged, taking advantage of the new possibilities offered by hybridizing physical and digital layers. in reversing the supremacy of centralisation over individual actions, citizens can become aware of their power and organize themselves on the web. we have the necessary technology, knowledge and dynamics to put in place more open processes of urban administration and management. citizens have already started to move; and although public administration could take advantage of such independent and autonomous processes to deal with complex situations, it appears that a clear political

automated social media that fosters engagement: tweet old post and paper.li (before it's news) i used to loathe anything and everything automated when it came to social media posting on both facebook and twitter. i thought that it was lazy, not encouraging of engagement and the opposite of authentic. and i still feel this way, for the most part. i have come to a new conclusion though: when done right, a little automation is necessary. yes, you read that right – necessary. it is important that social media is authentic, focused on engagement, and not entirely consuming. we need to go about our daily lives, incorporating social media in a way that supplements what we do without hindering us or our work. some, and certain kinds, of automation makes it easy to maintain this balance. so, then, what’s the rule? what kinds of automation are okay and which aren’t? when automated tweets or facebook posts encourage engagement, then it’s okay. that is the rule. for example, installing wordpress plugins that automatically send your most recent blog posts to facebook and twitter are genius. they save time without sacrificing authenticity and ensure that no matter how rushed you are, your posts get shared via social media. at the current moment i have two favorites when it comes to social automation: the wordpress plugin tweet old post and the application paper.li. let me break them down for you. tweet old post why not re-share posts from a previous week or month? as long as you

Article 10 - harnessing twitter’s full potential
harnessing twitter’s full potential (before it's news) the conversation about global marketing via social media has been steadily growing for years and shows no sign of letting up. for companies looking to attract and communicate fluently with a global customer base, social networking became a requirement long ago. but what about niche and local businesses, who are more interested in attracting folks from their own neighborhood than from the other side of the world? twitter is a powerful tool for local businesses too, because it allows you to find people according to specific interests and locations, then engage them in conversation. why tweet? the usual answer is that twitter’s more than 140 million users represent a lucrative global market. but if you run a neighborhood cafe or a boutique fitness center, you’re probably much more interested in the customers two blocks away. what you may not realize is that twitter can help you to find them too, to find out specifically what they’re interested in and to make them aware of your business. twitter basics twitter is distinct from other social networks in its focus on brevity and speed. all messages are limited to 140 characters, including the screen names of users tagged in them. links are counted as well, further shortening your messages. messages — or “tweets” — are public by default, reaching everyone who follows you. you can address an individual by including @(user name) in the text. it is also possible to send private messages, but only to those who follow you. by using

“we had some things in writing that they couldn’t interfere with the publication of the research no matter what the result was,” he said. he noted, though, that some at the company had been “pretty confident that we were going to find this result.” a news release sent by a spokeswoman at the university of california, san diego, drives the point home. “the research confirms what scientists have known for a long time about the offline world: people who have stronger social networks live longer,” the release said. the study was based on 12 million social media profiles made available to the researchers by facebook, as well as records from the california department of health. it found that “moderate use” of facebook was associated with the lowest mortality rate, and that receiving friend requests correlated with reduced mortality, but that sending friend requests did not. mr. hobbs and the paper’s other authors matched records from california’s department of public health with those of california facebook users, preserving privacy by aggregating the data before analyzing it, the release said. all of the subjects of the study were born from 1945 to 1989. the paper found that people with large or even average social networks lived longer than people who had very small social networks. it was “a finding consistent with classic studies of offline relationships and longevity,” the release said. the paper itself acknowledges the study’s “many limitations,” saying that facebook is unique among social media websites and that its data might not be more broadly

Article 4 - the online video view: we can count it, but can we count on it?
for decades, tv viewership was measured primarily by one company, nielsen, and expressed as relatively straightforward ratings — a currency upon which 30- and 60-second television ads were bought and sold. digital video pairs more precise measurement with a vast proliferation of metrics and formats: videos viewed live, or later; on phones, computers or other devices; with obvious intention, after a search, or more incidentally, as in a feed filled with other posts; for seconds, minutes or hours. even within the same company’s online entities, data is hard to reconcile. “you have twitter now with live video, then you have a periscope product, then you have vine, and they all integrate into this feed,” said nick cicero, founder of delmondo, a social media marketing and analytics firm. “then you have twitter on tv, where you can watch live video from your couch.” “it’s really hard to say what is comparable to what,” he said. those who post videos can afford to look at these shifting definitions of what counts as a view with at least a modicum of humor. but for the advertising industry, audience measurements translate directly into dollar amounts, and the different methods to measure views — and the fact that the information is all self-reported by the technology companies — are problems. then came the recent admission by facebook that for years it had miscalculated its video viewing metric, giving its partners the impression that their videos had been viewed for longer,

Article 5 - facebook needs real resolve for fake-news threat
117.33 usd facebook is facing a repeat of its mobile crisis of 2012. when the company went public more than four years ago, it was a smartphone disaster. it only had rudimentary mobile apps, and it was starting from scratch to rework its advertising business for people who surfed facebook on their phones. the mobile challenge was the biggest reason facebook lost half of its stock market value, or roughly $50 billion, in the first few months after its ipo. under mark zuckerberg's direction, facebook turned itself inside out to crack smartphones. within a year or so, facebook's marshall plan for mobile was succeeding. and last quarter, the company generated 84 percent of its advertising revenue from people who viewed facebook on smartphones and other mobile devices. problem solved facebook in a few years went from generating almost no revenue on smartphones to deriving the vast majority of its sales from mobile advertising source: facebook financial filings facebook now needs a new marshall plan to tackle the trickier twin crises of bogus information spreading like wildfire to facebook's population of 1.8 billion monthly users and the echo chamber within facebook's digital walls. the problems are obvious to most regular facebook users. the computer models that assemble the facebook news feed are tuned to show more information they think users will like and click on. that means -- like tuning the tv to msnbc 24 hours a day -- people can hang out on facebook and never be confronted by ideas that challenge their own views.

Article 6 - a new kind of leaker for an internet age
it’s important to note that mr. snowden did not just dump a bunch of unredacted documents on the web and slink back to his job. he apparently thought a great deal about where the information belonged and contacted barton gellman, who had a long and respected career in national security reporting at the washington post. according to an article by mr. gellman in monday’s post, mr. snowden asked for guarantees about what the post would print, and when. after the post said it could not provide any guarantees, according to mr. gellman, mr. snowden turned to glenn greenwald of the guardian, who has covered national security and secrecy issues in a chronic and ferocious manner. (mr. greenwald disputes that timeline, saying he has been in contact with mr. snowden since february). in spite of the uproar around wikleaks and a new age of electronic drop boxes, there has never been a shortage of whistles; what has been in short supply is people to blow them. in this instance, the web is not just a repository of leaked material, but a means of changing the dynamics of the debate into a two-way affair in which the public has access to the leaker. the administration, in both its public remarks and its investigations into leaks, has tried to portray those who leak as marginal people with nefarious motivations. by using the web and speaking on his own behalf, mr. snowden is not

Article 7 - how facebook is changing the way its users consume journalism
though other services, like twitter and google news, can also exert a large influence, facebook is at the forefront of a fundamental change in how people consume journalism. most readers now come to it not through the print editions of newspapers and magazines or their home pages online, but through social media and search engines driven by an algorithm, a mathematical formula that predicts what users might want to read. it is a world of fragments, filtered by code and delivered on demand. for news organizations, said cory haik, senior editor for digital news at the washington post, the shift represents “the great unbundling” of journalism. just as the music industry has moved largely from selling albums to songs bought instantly online, publishers are increasingly reaching readers through individual pieces rather than complete editions of newspapers or magazines. a publication’s home page, said edward kim, a co-founder of simplereach, will soon be important more as an advertisement of its brand than as a destination for readers. “people won’t type in washingtonpost.com anymore,” ms. haik said. “it’s search and social.” photo the shift raises questions about the ability of computers to curate news, a role traditionally played by editors. it also has broader implications for the way people consume information, and thus how they see the world. in an interview at facebook’s sprawling headquarters here, which has a giant, self-driving golf cart that takes workers between buildings, mr. marra said he did not think too much about his

Article 9 - in unsettled times, media can be a call to action, or a distraction

Title: things that tweet
Content: (before it's news) i was at breakfast with a friend yesterday who told me about a project he did with some twitter data around weather. he said as he was pouring through the data, he saw that there were bursts of tweets at certain times. he dug into the data and saw that it was weather vanes and thermometers that were tweeting out their data. it got me thinking about things that tweet (like weather vanes, refridgerators, traffic lights, etc) and their role in the land of social media. i believe that devices and sensors that broadcast their data via social media channels are an important source of social data and engagement. and for some reason, they are way more common on twitter than any other social platform. have you ever seen a weather vane on facebook? i have not. if they exist i’d love to know about them. i want to understand the internet of things and its role in social media. i suspect that the symmetric friending model and the use of real names/real people in the facebook system is a hindrance to devices updating facebook pages, but i could be wrong. services that are too determinent in their use case are ultimately limiting in their extensability to important new uses. machines are reliable sources of information and the social services that are friendly to them have a number of interesting opportunities in front of them.

The Digital Landscape: A Complex Web of Influence

In recent years, the digital landscape has undergone significant transformations. Social media platforms have become integral to our daily lives, with billions of users worldwide. Twitter, once a hub for real-time discussions and news, has faced criticism over stagnant audience growth and its business value.

Meanwhile, Facebook's influence extends beyond its core platform. The company's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp has expanded its reach, while its live video broadcasting feature has become increasingly popular. However, concerns over fake news and the spread of misinformation have led to calls for greater regulation.

The rise of social media has also had a profound impact on how we consume journalism. Algorithms-driven feeds have fragmented our attention, making it harder to discover new content. News organizations are adapting by focusing on individual pieces rather than complete editions, while Facebook's algorithm prioritizes content that users are likely to engage with.

In the workplace, technology can be both a blessing and a curse. Employees often use their personal devices for work, which can lead to disengagement if not addressed. Companies like SAP are exploring ways to provide employees with similar capabilities, enabling new levels of engagement and individualized experiences.

As we navigate this complex digital landscape, it's essential to consider the role of media in times of unrest. Social media can be both a call to action and a distraction, spreading messages of protest and caution. In Egypt, for example, disruptions in cellphone coverage and internet access exacerbated the unrest, forcing citizens to engage with

The Dark Side of Social Media: 7 Habits to Avoid

Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, connecting us with others and providing a platform for self-expression. However, beneath its seemingly harmless surface lies a complex web of habits that can have serious consequences.

One such habit is the tendency to overshare on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This can lead to unintended consequences, including job loss or even lawsuits. Employers may monitor employees' online activity, and posting inflammatory or discriminatory content can result in termination.

Another habit to avoid is stalking. Social media has made it easier for individuals to track others, often without their knowledge or consent. This can be particularly concerning for those who are already vulnerable, such as children or individuals with a history of abuse.

Moreover, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have become breeding grounds for online harassment. Cyberbullying can take many forms, from subtle insults to full-blown threats. It's essential to maintain a healthy online presence and avoid engaging with trolls or bullies.

Furthermore, the rise of social media has also led to the proliferation of fake news and disinformation. This can have serious consequences, including influencing public opinion or even inciting violence.

To protect yourself from these risks, it's essential to be mindful of your online behavior. Here are a few tips:

* Be cautious when sharing personal information on social media.
* Manage your privacy settings to control who sees your content.
* Use secure and private internet connections

As the days grow shorter, many of us are finding it challenging to tend to our gardens. However, with a little creativity and planning, you can still enjoy a bountiful harvest despite the changing seasons.

One popular food that's gaining attention is the sweet potato. Not only is it a great source of fiber and vitamins, but it's also relatively low in calories compared to regular potatoes. In fact, some argue that sweet potatoes are superior due to their higher nutritional profile.

If you're looking for ways to preserve your harvest, consider growing squash circles. These mysterious formations have been observed in various gardens, and while the cause is unknown, they can be a fascinating addition to your garden decor.

For those interested in preserving vegetables, dehydrating sweet corn is a great option. Simply blanch the kernels, dry them, and store them in a jar for later use. This method allows you to enjoy your harvest year-round, even during the hottest summer months.

In the kitchen, consider trying vegan custard-stuffed pumpkin recipes. These seasonal desserts are not only delicious but also healthier alternatives to traditional holiday treats. With ingredients like coconut yogurt, soaked cashew base, and maple syrup, you'll be enjoying a tasty and nutritious dessert in no time.

Lastly, don't forget about foraging for wild edibles like wood sorrel. This vitamin C-rich leafy green can add flavor and nutrition to your meals. Simply identify the plant correctly, harvest it sustainably, and enjoy its unique taste.

By exploring these options, you'll be well on your way to enjoying a bountiful harvest despite the changing seasons. Happy gardening!","A Taste of Tradition: Exploring the Flavors of Europe and Beyond

In a world where culinary trends come and go, there are some dishes that stand the test of time. From traditional German cuisine to modern twists on classic desserts, the flavors of Europe continue to captivate palates around the globe.

For those seeking an authentic taste of Germany, a visit to Oak Chalet in Bellmore, New York, is a must. The cozy restaurant boasts a rustic atmosphere, complete with moosehead overtures and traditional German touches. The menu features hearty dishes like roast loin of pork and wurst platters, all made with love and care.

Meanwhile, in the world of savory delights, carrot cake has undergone a transformation. Gone are the sweet treats of yesteryear; instead, chefs are experimenting with new flavors and ingredients to create unique desserts. One such example is the savory carrot cake, which combines the sweetness of carrots with tangy cream cheese frosting.

In the realm of fine dining, Kathy Butterly's latest exhibition at Tibor de Nagy showcases her mastery of clay, stoneware, and glaze. Her work is a testament to the art of ceramics, with intricate designs and clever references that will leave you in awe.

For those seeking inspiration for their next meal, consider the humble okra. This often-maligned vegetable has been transformed into a culinary delight by chefs like Lucy, who pairs it with crispy breadcrumbs and a side of creamy mascarpone.

As we continue to explore the world of flavors, one thing is clear: tradition and innovation go hand in hand. Whether you're indulging in classic German cuisine or experimenting with new desserts, there's always something to discover.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

a close look… (before it's news) with the days being so short now, and with having to work in london quite a lot, i haven’t seen much of the garden recently. it’s dark when i go out, and it’s dark when i come home. at the weekend though, i managed to take a good look. the blueberry bushes have mostly shed their leaves now, but there is one which still looks spectacular: i was surprised to see new flowers on the alpine strawberries. don’t they know it’s nearly the middle of november?! ﻿ the “black prince” chilli is still looking good too, covered with tiny red fruits. i don’t recommend this variety of chilli for culinary use, because its fruits are too fiddly to prepare, but it scores highly for its ornamental qualities. with its dark coloured foliage it could be attractive for flower-arrangers too! i was a bit annoyed to find that something had dug up one of my parsnips and had a nibble at it. evidently it didn’t like the taste, because the root had been gnawed but not eaten. hopefully this will convince whichever animal was responsible for this act of vandalism to leave the rest alone now. ﻿ i have been keeping a close eye on the “matsuri” broccoli and i see that the first of this current batch is nearing a useable size. ideally i would like to harvest two at a time, since this is a miniature variety

crispy braised fennel and potatoes (before it's news) fennel is one my favorite vegetables, and back in february i posted a few recipes as well as some tips for cooking. fennel can be a challenging ingredient in that if it is not cooked fully, its can be crunch and unappetizing. aside from shaving it super thin, raw, for a salad, braising is probably my favorite way of preparing fennel. in the past i’ve mostly braised fennel with lentils or other vegetables, but i just came across an awesome recipe for crispy cream braised potatoes and fennel. this recipe was posted on food 52, and won best root vegetable side dish. after making my own version of it, i can see why. the creamy potatoes coupled with the flavor of the fennel was just perfect. and how can you beat potatoes with cheese that has been crisped up in the broiler? because i mostly lactose intolerant, i opted for lactose free milk instead of half and half or cream. the results were still fabulous and i don’t think i missed too much. ingredients: serves 4 modified from emilyc’s recipe on food52 3 yukon gold potatoes (about 1.5 pounds) – peeled and cut into ~2″ chunks 2 fennel bulbs (about 1.5 pounds) – trimmed (with tough or bruised outer layers removed

(before it's news) crunchy mama, one of our guest contributors, serves up another wild food you should add to your hunt-gather-eat list. be sure to check out her bio at the end of the post on how she and her family are doing the stuff! disclaimer: this information is offered for educational purposes only. do your own due diligence before foraging wild edibles of any kind. green sour butterfly leaves (wood sorrel; oxalis) — crunchy mama’s wild edible adventures by thecrunchymamachronicles - guest contributor greetings, friends! next up in my wild edibles series is wood sorrel. wood sorrel might be mistaken by new foragers for clover but after reading this post you will know how to distinguish it from clover. it is similar to clover in that it has three small leaves coming from the end of a small stem. wood sorrel, however, has three heart-shaped leaves and the veins in the leaflets radiate out from the base whereas clover has three egg-shaped leaves and the veins in the leaflet come out from various points from the center vein. the wood sorrel flowers have 5 petals and the clover flowers have “lots of tiny pea-like flowers clustered together on flower heads” (kallas). click here to see images of clover flowers. both clover leaves and flowers and wood sorrel leaves and flowers are edible but the taste difference is very distinct. wood sorrel between my fingers

Article 8 - doomsday seed safety boxes – who has the keys?
doomsday seed safety boxes – who has the keys? % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the so-called “doomsday seed vault” now contains seeds of more than 525,000 crop varieties from around the world, making it the most diverse assemblage of crops anywhere. the seed vault was constructed deep in a mountain on a remote norwegian archipelago near the north pole as a fail-safe back-up to existing crop collections around the world. this idea is a good one of course, and underscores the concept that we do live on an ever changing planet and conceivably a planet at risk by us, the self-anointed intelligent specie, who sometimes performs very unintelligent acts, in fact… regularly performs unintelligent acts. almost every nation keeps collections of native seeds so local crops can be replanted in case of an agricultural disaster. the global seed vault, opened this year on the far-northern norwegian island of spitsbergen, is a backup for the backups. it’s badly needed — as many as half the seed banks in developing countries are at risk from natural disasters or general instability. the vault can hold up to 4.5 million samples, which will be kept dry at about 0°f (-18°c). even if the facility loses power, the arctic climate should keep the seeds viable for thousands of years. seeds from some of north america’s hottest chili

Article 9 - it’s that time of year again!
it’s that time of year again! (before it's news) i have never dehydrated sweet corn before, but it turned out very well. first, of course, i took the husks and silks off of the cobs, then i blanched them in boiling water for 3 minutes. next they were plunged into cold water. after that i cut the kernels off the cobs and put them on the sheets that you use for fruit leather, in the dehydrator and dried them until they were thoroughly dry. then, into the jar! there is more than a quart. can you believe that is about 1/2 bushel of sweet corn? and here is a photo of what i brought in today. there are a lot more potatoes out there, but the weather has been so hot and dry that some of them have begun to rot, so i’ve started digging them up. the tomatoes are really getting into full swing now, and the cucumbers and zucchinis are slowing down. i am so very grateful for all of this lovely organic produce! read more at simply homemaking source:

Article 10 - vegan custard stuffed pumpkin recipe
(before it's news) this vegan custard recipe was inspired by the cambodian recipe for sangkya, also known as songkya. traditional sangkya is an eggy custard with a strong coconut flavor. most recipes call for quite a bit of sugar, so this recipe is a loosely adapted interpretation of the original. it’s much healthier, completely vegan, and is a great alternative to flour-based holiday treats. this seasonal dessert does need to chill for several hours before serving, so plan ahead. the coconut yogurt and soaked cashew base are held together with coconut, garbanzo, and chia seed flour. the sweetness of the maple syrup is balanced with lemon zest and juice. you can adjust the amount of lemon, or add more coconut flakes if you want a less tart or more coconutty flavor. kabocha, or japanese pumpkin, is the best choice for this recipe. similar to butternut squash, the kabocha has fewer calories and many people say it tastes better. it’s a great source of beta-carotene, iron, vitamin c, and fiber. you can substitute pie pumpkins if you have trouble finding kabocha. when selecting your kabocha squash, choose a squat, wide shape over a taller, round one. this will give the top of the custard a better chance to brown while baking. you can also skip the pumpkin entirely if you’re just looking for a vegan baked custard recipe. if you choose this route, make sure

Article 2 - do i dare grill a peach?
i did not taste a fresh peach until i was 28 years old. in our house in hawaii , we ate canned peaches, the flesh lurid and spongy, slick with syrup. we stowed them next to the canned litchis and the spam, a shelf above the powdered milk. i didn’t care for them: too sweet. but my father loved them, especially with cottage cheese. it was a treat he rationed himself carefully, a habit ingrained, perhaps, from his childhood in england during the second world war. my mother, who survived the japanese occupation of the philippines , had a similar faith in food built to last. i knew what peaches were supposed to look like. i’d seen them in books: “momotaro (peach boy),” “james and the giant peach.” later, in high school, there was j. alfred prufrock, dithering. did i dare to eat one? not until i moved to new york, where one day, my incredulous boyfriend (now husband) handed me an intact, fuzzy peach, and said, “it’s time.” i grudgingly took a bite. oh, those lost years. i am making up for it now. i love the velvety skin, how it dimples at the touch when it’s ripe. i love the eternal surprise when you break through the skin and the juice trickles down your tongue. this is a

Article 4 - the savory side of carrot cake
carrot cake, on the other hand, had many enticing qualities to recommend it. it was gloriously moist and dark, with raisins and walnuts, sweetly spiced with clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. the fact that the cake was full of carrots barely registered, and it certainly didn’t taste like carrots. i adored the tangy cream-cheese frosting. despite the vivid and fond memories, i haven’t tasted carrot cake — or any cake, for that matter — in years. my sweet tooth is satisfied with a couple of good cookies, maybe some gelato. i tend more toward salt than sugar, so lately i have been toying with savory baked goods, experimenting with various spices to flavor flatbreads, griddlecakes and biscotti. photo as it happened, i had invited guests, one of whom was celebrating a birthday, to a dinner party recently. carrot cake immediately came to mind, and i was determined to make it a savory one. advertisement continue reading the main story i could picture it clearly: a well-spiced cake with not a speck of sugar. it would be iced with thick crème fraîche and adorned with cilantro sprigs, black sesame seeds and red pepper, with a single candle at the center. at first glance, it would look like dessert. very trompe l’oeil. recipe development began. i can report a few failures. i wanted a tender cake with a carrot-colored interior, but a

Article 6 - in lapland, nature’s outdoor sculpture park
sabrina haberli, a swiss transplant who was our guide for the day, was ecstatic as we suited up, stressing that the weather was the kind of ideal conditions she sees just a few times a year: windless, cloudless and warm enough to venture out. she said the snow sculptures would stand out against the azure sky and, if the conditions continued into the evening, we would see the sunset tinge them with shades of orange, pink and lavender. but the fact remained that by our standards — four swiss tourists, one dutch, a dane and an american — it was cold. fortunately, ms. haberli, who has been escorting groups here for seven winters, had a wealth of tips, like showing us how to line our hiking boots with newspaper to block the cold and to layer several pieces of light clothing to avoid sweating and, later, chills. still, the cold remained a concern as we set out, although ms. haberli assured us that our labored, ducklike waddling over the snow would soon warm us up. she was right. within 20 minutes of setting out from a cafe used by cross-country skiers, some of us remarked that we felt mysteriously comfortable despite the extreme chill. we followed ms. haberli in a single file, our snowshoes leaving only shallow tracks as the lightweight metal frames prevented us from sinking into the three-foot-deep snow. “the only thing you could hear is your breathing

Article 7 - wines for thanksgiving that refresh the palate
but if your thanksgiving is anything like mine, you’ve got a lot more than four at the table. they start eating and drinking early and keep at it until late, with dinner a free-for-all buffet. most likely, you won’t be using the finest goblets. plastic is not out of the question. so here are the two crucial points to consider when selecting thanksgiving wines: versatility this is not the time to fuss over specific food and wine pairings. you need all-purpose wines that will go with many different sorts of dishes. one should be red, the other white, with additional sparkling or rosé wines at your discretion. you will want plenty. few things are as sad as running out of wine on thanksgiving, except running out of food. figure a bottle per adult. energy wines should be nimble and refreshing, energizing rather than fatiguing and low in alcohol, if possible. it’s a long, tiring meal, and the last thing you want are heavy, alcoholic, torpor-inducing wines. instead, they should be light and exhilarating, the sort that promote salivation rather than comas. the challenge is determining which wines fit this bill. enter the wine panel. all the wines we brought would have been fine for a thanksgiving meal, even the cider. it’s important to understand, though, that these are representative of the sorts of wines to seek out. most likely, these specific bottles will be hard to find, but

Article 8 - kathy butterly
tibor de nagy 724 fifth avenue, at 57th street through march 16 kathy butterly is a genius in clay, stoneware and glaze, a miniaturist of fabergé refinement and in her own way one of the best artists of our time. at 38, she deserves the respect and prominence that has, also belatedly, been granted artists like ken price and ron nagle, whose heir she clearly is. but at the moment, ms. butterly may be a genius veering ever so slightly in the wrong direction. in her ninth new york show in nine years -- which may be a few too many -- she is subtly but noticeably playing up the humor that has always been an element in her work at the expense of form and color. she is favoring the visual puns, sight gags and cuteness that plague so much ceramic art. her 15 new pieces continue to be polymorphously perverse hybrids; they combine references to painting, all manner of decorative arts (from carved jade to upholstery), cartoons, the figure and architecture, while also deploying breathtaking bits of trompe l'oeil. the formula involves an elaborate pedestal base that often resembles a coffee table, made of anything from bamboo to concrete; a twisted, melting cylindrical form that suggests a wheel-thrown vase gone badly awry but that also resembles abstracted flesh, a literal ''clay body,'' as it were; and a topping-off element

Article 9 - kitchen sage
""i like red onions for this chutney -- they give it a sharper taste and some contrast to the sweetness of the mango and peppers,"" he said as he left-handedly diced one in the airy kitchen that abuts their ground floor dining room on one end and a verdant city garden on the other. lucy formed her tart shell -- she would later line it with mascarpone and whipped cream, then big, fat berries -- then curled up in the corner and perused ""essentials of baking"" from the gang at williams-sonoma. kurt started slicing two pounds of okra into mathematically perfect 1/2-inch rounds. okra pods terrify most northerners, largely because their interiors can be slimy (the okra, not the yankees, depending), with a texture not unlike an especially gooey oyster. ""it's a strange little vegetable,"" kurt said. ""people either don't know it or think they won't like it. i never had it growing up in nebraska, but a friend made it in bread crumbs . . . fantastic!"" he mixed the okra bits with a couple of eggs, a little milk and salt and pepper. ""if you slice them thicker, you get more of an okra sensation and less of a french fry,"" he said. ""i've tried it with flour and wheat germ, but crumbs are the best. and i've tried frying it in olive oil, but

Article 10 - an anniversary party for a man and his restaurant
guy savoy, one of france’s finest chefs, many of whom came here to pay a kind of homage, said that “ducasse shows us tonight that he’s the leader of french gastronomy in the world.” only mr. ducasse could have gathered together so many distinguished chefs, he said. “his organizational talent is also extraordinary,” mr. savoy said. “chapeau!” the food at saturday’s dinner, served to more than 400 people, was both regional and refined. papery sliced raw baby vegetables of the area — 15 of them, including fennel, eggplant and spiny artichoke — were in a crystal glass to be dipped in an olive paste. small gamberoni, or red shrimp, from san remo were served with a seafood and coral aspic and a dollop of superb chinese caviar. then spelt with tiny artichokes and white truffle. then local fish — red mullet, scorpion fish, john dory, sea bream, tiny squid and octopus, in a light fishy broth. then a small pastry filled with game birds and chard, with a pungent salmis sauce, vegetables and a truffle salad. then a dessert of cooked apple and wild quince, with an ice cream made with cream from local cows and a touch of salt. and for those who could manage it, chocolates and a hazelnut shortbread. all of which

Title: Exploring the World of Gardening and Food Preservation

As the days grow shorter, many of us are finding it challenging to tend to our gardens. However, with a little creativity and planning, you can still enjoy a bountiful harvest despite the changing seasons.

One popular food that's gaining attention is the sweet potato. Not only is it a great source of fiber and vitamins, but it's also relatively low in calories compared to regular potatoes. In fact, some argue that sweet potatoes are superior due to their higher nutritional profile.

If you're looking for ways to preserve your harvest, consider growing squash circles. These mysterious formations have been observed in various gardens, and while the cause is unknown, they can be a fascinating addition to your garden decor.

For those interested in preserving vegetables, dehydrating sweet corn is a great option. Simply blanch the kernels, dry them, and store them in a jar for later use. This method allows you to enjoy your harvest year-round, even during the hottest summer months.

In the kitchen, consider trying vegan custard-stuffed pumpkin recipes. These seasonal desserts are not only delicious but also healthier alternatives to traditional holiday treats. With ingredients like coconut yogurt, soaked cashew base, and maple syrup, you'll be enjoying a tasty and nutritious dessert in no time.

foreign enemies and traitors % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) many of you who know me personally, know i love apocalyptic entertainment and dystopian literature. i eat up novels such as “hunger games,” “the giver,” and “divergent.” i was moved to no end by ray bradbury’s classic “fahrenheit 451.” i am perpetually glued to the idiot box when the “walking dead” is on, and i will watch reruns all day. it’s not because i love zombies. as a matter of fact, i didn’t even give “walking dead” a chance at first, because zombies… meh. but the show is not about the walking dead. it’s about those still living, and that fascinates me. the thought of an apocalyptic event doesn’t appeal to me, but society’s reaction to it does. what happens when government completely breaks down in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event? be it zombies, earthquakes, floods, war or the complete disappearance of electric power (see: revolution) – what happens when a complete breakdown of law and order occurs? how does government react? how do the people react to the actions of said government? these are all questions i love to explore, both in literature and in other forms of entertainment. i’m ashamed to say that i only recently picked up matt bracken’s “foreign enemies and traitors” –

(before it's news) (salem / baghdad) – i first heard of the ‘human meat grinder’ when i was in baghdad, iraq in 2008 on a particularly hot summer day, standing on saddam hussein’s old parade ground. i visited with a u.s. army historian that day; it was a unique coincidence that we found each other beneath the famous crossed swords, as i’m always in the market for historical information. we discussed several important points about the war that in his mind, really justified the coalition’s invasion of iraq. i have to say that at the time, he was convincing. and in all fairness, this man probably believed what he said to be true, i would like to think so. this officer had heard the story that dated back to 2003, when information about the alleged ‘human mean grinder’ first hit the presses at the independent with statements from ken joseph jr., who was one of the anti-war human shields that had entered iraq in 2003. joseph, who said he was a pastor with the assyrian church, apparently had a real change of heart after hearing horrible stories about hussein’s meat grinder in baghdad. he apparently went from peace activist to war advocate while he was there. the independent quoted joseph saying:“their tales

Article 1 - religious intolerance in india
hope is in danger of crumbling that prime minister narendra modi would rein in the divisive agenda of his militant hindu-nationalist supporters and allow india to concentrate on the important work of economic reform, and the blame lies squarely with mr. modi. during the last days of its winter session ending on tuesday, parliament was unable to deal with important legislative business because of repeated adjournments and an uproar over attempts by hindu groups to convert christians and muslims. the issue has come to a head following a “homecoming” campaign by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and the vishwa hindu parishad — groups dedicated to transforming india’s secular democracy into a hindu state — to “reconvert” christians and muslims to hinduism. in recent weeks, hindu militants have engineered conversions of muslims and christians in agra and in the states of gujarat and kerala. police are investigating accusations that people have been induced to participate in mass conversion meetings by a combination of intimidation and bribery, including the promise of food ration cards. attacks on christians and their places of worship have intensified in recent weeks. one of new delhi’s biggest churches burned down on dec. 1 — arson is being blamed — and christmas carolers were attacked on their way home in the city of hyderabad on dec. 12. more than 80 percent of indians are hindus, but muslims, christians

our latest look around the world takes us to argentina: hello, i’m boris from buenos aires, and i want to bring a different latin american (south america) perspective to the u.s. elections, if my knowledge allows it. this was a year of deep changes to the region, as exactly 12 months ago mauricio macri won against peronist heir daniel scioli in a upset election. then were the elections in peru and the ouster of dilma rousseff in brazil. and now the world is changing again, with two important questions for the southern cone that a trump’s victory raises. the first one is the hemispheric question. macri’s slogan last year was “to open argentina to the world,” especially with the united states. the “pj,” the peronist party, was protectionist like trump and an ally of russia and china. when macri won, obama visited buenos aires as bill clinton did it two decades ago. susana malcorra, our secretary of state, wished publicly on monday for a hillary clinton presidency. after rousseff's impeachment a couple of months ago, michel temer [the new president of brazil] and macri developed an understanding to join the regional bloc, mercosur, to a free trade zone such as the pacific alliance, tpp, or a free trade deal with the u.s. and the e.u. now

Article 3 - often outscored and unsupported, but over .500
“it’s been kind of weird, honestly,” closer chris perez said. “if we’re ahead after five, we win. and even if we’re down by one or two, it seems big. it’s just one of those anomalies. “when we get beat, we get beat. it’s usually big runs. and when we win, it’s close. the run differential is not going to be there.” perez and his setup men, vinnie pestano and joe smith, are the team’s greatest strength. the rest of the bullpen has been shaky, but the three late-inning relievers have helped the indians go 11-2 in one-run games. cleveland has lost only twice when leading after six innings; the yankees have three such losses. “the main thing has been our bullpen, the back end of our bullpen,” manager manny acta said. “close ballgames we feel we have a very good chance of winning, because those guys at the end are lights-out.” starters ubaldo jimenez and justin masterson have pitched well lately. the indians are strong up the middle, with second baseman jason kipnis and shortstop asdrubal cabrera, and their batters walk a lot. they missed a chance to trade for third baseman kevin youkilis, who was sent from boston to the central-leading chicago white sox on sunday, but antonetti said improvement would have to

Article 5 - clinton fever: a delighted india has all the symptoms
one prolific indian columnist said in an interview that mr. clinton had broken through the stereotypical role of the american heavy -- and that the country was smitten. ''india is mesmerized by clinton,'' said the columnist, shobha de, who is also a well-known novelist. ''he's cast a spell. even the sanest of people have lost their reason.'' mr. clinton has made the connection, first of all, by letting them know he empathizes with their troubles. the massacre of about 35 sikh men in kashmir on the eve of his visit gave him an immediate sense of the weekly, and sometimes daily, toll of violence, as well as a point of connection with his hosts. in his public and private remarks, he shared their sense of outrage and grief. today, on the second day of his india visit, he described his anguish at the hijacking of an indian airlines commercial jet in december. he also revealed that he had met rachna katyal, whose husband was killed by the hijackers as the couple were returning from their honeymoon -- an act of cruelty that deeply angered many indians.

Article 6 - vast force is deployed for security at convention
officials from the national security council quietly visited new york last week for briefings with the local authorities. today, homeland security secretary tom ridge will inspect arrangements for the convention. the backbone of security is being provided by the 37,000-member new york police department, which has a budget larger than all but 19 of the world's standing armies. to prevent an attack, the department will flood the streets with officers and employ high and low technology, from seven surveillance helicopters to plainclothes detectives traveling the subways and eyeballing other riders. up to 10,000 officers, many reassigned from narcotics and other duties, will be part of an enormous show of force around madison square garden. that display will include special heavily armed ''hercules'' antiterror squads, snipers and phalanxes of officers set up around the arena to search buses and trucks before they enter the area. in addition to the helicopters, several of which can feed close-up video surveillance images to mobile command centers on the ground, 26 launches will patrol waterways, and officers will use 181 bomb-sniffing dogs, many of them borrowed from other law enforcement agencies.

Article 8 - mumbai inquiry focuses on militants
but the director general, p. s. pasricha, said “the modus operandi does suggest their involvement.” the organization and scale of the attacks, the type of explosive involved and the use of remote control devices all suggested that lashkar-e-toiba may have been involved, perhaps in conjunction with local groups, he said. “still, it would be premature and misleading to say anything about their involvement at this point of investigations as forensic lab reports are awaited,” he added. officials in delhi were spoke even more cautiously. rajneesh kumar, the deputy director of communications at the ministry of home affairs, said it was too early to comment on who might have set off the bombs. “initially, we were focusing on the relief and rescue operation, but now the investigation is under way,” he said in a telephone interview. photo asked to comment on widespread speculation that kashmiri militants were involved, he said: “it would be very premature to go into which leads we are currently pursuing. the security agencies are looking into who might be behind this, but discussing the involvement of one particular group or another would at this stage be a very speculative exercise.” representatives from lashkar-e-toiba, whose name means army of the pure, telephoned several indian news organizations to deny involvement. “these are inhuman and barbaric acts” a man who identified himself as “doctor ghaznavi”, a spokesman for the group, told reuters. “isl

Article 9 - is delhi so different from steubenville?
in some places, rape is endemic: in south africa, a survey found that 37 percent of men reported that they had raped a woman. in others, rape is institutionalized as sex trafficking. everywhere, rape often puts the victim on trial: in one poll, 68 percent of indian judges said that “provocative attire” amounts to “an invitation to rape.” americans watched the events after the delhi gang rape with a whiff of condescension at the barbarity there, but domestic violence and sex trafficking remain a vast problem across the united states. one obstacle is that violence against women tends to be invisible and thus not a priority. in delhi, of 635 rape cases reported in the first 11 months of last year, only one ended in conviction. that creates an incentive for rapists to continue to rape, but in any case that reported number of rapes is delusional. they don’t include the systematized rape of sex trafficking. india has, by my reckoning, more women and girls trafficked into modern slavery than any country in the world. (china has more prostitutes, but they are more likely to sell sex by choice.) on my last trip to india, i tagged along on a raid on a brothel in kolkata, organized by the international justice mission. in my column at the time, i focused on a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old imprisoned in the brothel, and mentioned a 17-year

Article 10 - girl thanks civil aviation minister for swapping seats with her and her ill mom

The style and content of this article are consistent with reliable news reporting, including quotes from individuals involved in the story and a focus on the significance of Rodriguez's farewell performance. In contrast, the other two articles do not align as closely with the facts in the given article, particularly the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE which discusses a different team (Cubs) and an unrelated topic (pitcher scuffing).","Tensions Run High in Chicago Cubs Dugout

The Chicago Cubs' recent win over the White Sox was marred by a heated discussion between pitcher John Lackey and first baseman Anthony Rizzo. According to sources, the two had a brief, animated exchange in the dugout after Lackey gave up a two-out, two-run double in the second inning.

Rizzo's teammate, Addison Russell, described the incident as ""over almost as quickly as it began."" However, the tension between the two players was palpable, with some speculating that the discussion may have been related to Rizzo's demotion to a full-time designated hitter role last season.

The Cubs' win marked a turning point in their four-game series against the White Sox. The team had dropped Game 1 earlier in the week, but bounced back behind Willson Contreras' three-run homer in the first inning.

In other news, Yankees manager Joe Girardi has been impressed with the performance of rookie pitcher Michael Pineda. According to sources, Pineda's fastball and slider have been particularly effective, earning praise from CC Sabathia.

Meanwhile, Phillies fan Scott Scuffed is calling for a change in the way pitchers are treated in baseball. In an interview, he expressed frustration with the lack of accountability for pitchers who scuff the ball, citing examples of pitchers who have gotten away with this behavior.

The Yankees' recent signing of Brian McCann has also sparked debate among fans and pundits. While some have praised the move as a shrewd business decision, others have criticized it as an ""expensive mistake."" McCann himself has taken a low-key approach to the situation, shrugging off comments from critics like Russell Martin.

As trade rumor season heats up, one question on everyone's mind is: would you trade Hughes and Joba for Cole Hamels? While some fans are calling for a blockbuster deal, others are skeptical of the rumors.","Yankees' Manager Joe Girardi Breaks Down in Tears After Alex Rodriguez's Final Game

In a poignant moment, Yankees manager Joe Girardi broke down in tears during a post-game news conference after Alex Rodriguez's final game as a Yankee. The emotional outburst came after Girardi was asked about the significance of Rodriguez's farewell performance. ""I know how much he loves this game, and I feel for him,"" Girardi said, his voice trembling.

Rodriguez, who played his final game at third base, expressed gratitude to Girardi for allowing him to play in his old position. The two had been at odds earlier in the week, but Rodriguez absolved Girardi of any blame, saying he was ""forever grateful"" for the opportunity.

The Yankees' victory marked a milestone in their rivalry with the Red Sox, who have struggled to find success against their arch-rivals. The teams have a long history, dating back to 1910, and the Yankees hold an edge in the series, having won 18 of the past 29 meetings.

In other news, pitcher Mike Pineda dominated his first outing since September, allowing only one run over six innings. Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks' Dan Haren improved to 4-1, with fans seemingly unaware of the controversy surrounding the Mets' recent struggles.

The Yankees' bullpen has been under scrutiny lately, but manager Joe Torre remains confident in his team's ability to perform. ""He's pretty remarkable in the way he can pitch in any situation and change speeds with the ball,"" Torre said of pitcher Andy Pettitte.

As the season heats up, the Yankees are looking to make a statement against their rivals. With Rodriguez's farewell performance behind them, they're ready to focus on the task at hand.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

did john lackey and anthony rizzo confront eachother in dugout? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the chicago cubs left tuesday’s game at wrigley field as winners over the white sox, after dropping game one of the four-game set on monday. it didn’t take long for the cubs to get on the board as willson contreras hit a three-run homer off of carlos rodon to give them an early 3-0 lead in the first inning. but the white sox answered back, capped with a rodon two-run double off of john lackey. with the white sox trailing just 3-2 early, tensions were apparently running high in the cubs dugout. according to gordon wittenmyer of the chicago sun-times, lackey and rizzo apparently had a discussion that was a little heated. after lackey gave up a two-out, two-run double to white sox pitcher carlos rodon in a frustrating second inning, he could be seen bumping rizzo as he passed him in the dugout. rizzo and lackey then engaged in a brief, animated discussion that for a moment looked heated. “i’m not sure what happened,” said teammate addison russell, who said it was over almost as quickly as it began. “i sat down and heard something,” catcher willson contreras said, “but i didn’t hear clearly so i

big mccann laughes off little martin (before it's news) well, brian mccann just impressed me more today than he did yesterday. look, i loved the brian mccann deal and many of us do in yankeeland, despite what russell martin thinks of it. truth be told, no one cares what russell martin thinks anymore anyway, but he made headlines yesterday calling the yankees signing of mccann an “expensive mistake” and while he’s entitled to his opinions, he sounds like a blabbering idiot. read russell martin sounds like one pathetic loser. that’s my opinion. now brian mccann could have handled it 2 ways; he could have held a grudge, like i tend to do, or just ignore it and prove to martin, the yankees, the fans and himself that words don’t matter.. actions do. the star ledger had the response from mccann on the martin situation. here’s that story from brendan kuty: “brian mccann stood in the hallway outside the home clubhouse at george m. steinbrenner field. then he shook his head a little and shrugged. “i got nothing,” mccann said. …mccann declined further comment before lightly jogging toward the trainer’s room hours prior to the yankees’ home matchup with the red sox.” that’s a freaking man. that statement spoke volumes because it wasn’t a statement at all. in other

watching keppinger, youkilis & chavez headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! according to danny knobler of cbs sports.com, his tweet here indicates that the yankees want jeff keppinger…bad. it would mean a 3 year deal worth about $13 million, according to knobler. keppinger could easily fill in at 3rd base while alex rodriguez heals and that’s fine. he’s an infielder and plays all infield positions. perfect utility guy but i would assume 3rd base is where the yanks would want him. there was once a guy that no one in new york had faith in when they signed him out of oakland. his name was scott brosius and he ended up being a star in new york. i’m not saying that will happen with keppinger, but i see this kid lighting it up in the bronx with a big opportunity waiting. eric chavez is also on the yankees radar, read here. if we had him, keppinger at shortstop and throw eduardo nunez in the mix, (i just goaned) and it’s a band aid situation until we know for sure that derek jeter is back on his feet and alex is back, i predict july for that. personally, i love the idea of kevin youkilis, but that’s just me. a

Article 1 - joe girardi and alex rodriguez part on a poignant note
photo on a night overflowing with good will, affection and even some joy, joe girardi broke down in tears on friday following alex rodriguez’s final game as a yankee. “i know how much he loves this game, and i feel for him,” girardi said in a trembling voice during a postgame news conference. “he’s not going out a champion, and he’s not going out on a 30-home-run season.” no, rodriguez went out a .200 hitter. but he also went out as a third baseman, thanks to girardi, who, after an awkward week of refusing to start the former superstar in boston, granted rodriguez’s sentimental request to play his old position for one batter. for all the strain that had developed between the two men over the last several weeks — especially on wednesday, when girardi expressed anger at members of the news media for their coverage of it — rodriguez absolved girardi on friday, essentially forgiving his manager for not having played him earlier. advertisement continue reading the main story “after the game, i went up to him, shook his hand and gave him a big hug and said, ‘thank you for letting me play third base,’” rodriguez said. “i am forever grateful. that was quite a moment.”

Article 2 - history repeats itself in more ways than one at the stadium
kevin millar had wondered earlier how the yankee stadium voices would react to the red sox as conquering villains. ""i want to see what they chant,"" millar said. ""they can't chant '1918,' and with pedro on the mets, they can't chant, 'who's your daddy?""' during the pregame introductions, the red sox, one by one, were greeted with boos, but the boos sounded more obligatory than emotional. including last night, the yankees have opened the season 29 times against the red sox and hold an 18-10 advantage, with the 1910 game a tie. the yankees are 9-3 at the stadium, 7-4 at fenway park, and 2-1-1 at hilltop park in upper manhattan. but in the only two openers at the polo grounds, in 1917 and 1919, the red sox won both as the reigning world series champions. two of the stadium openers with the red sox had a theatrical twist -- babe ruth's home run in 1923 in the first game played at the stadium, and ted williams's debut in 1939 as a rookie. after the yankees acquired the babe from the red sox in 1920, his record 54 home runs that season inspired a season attendance of 1,289,422 at the polo grounds. john mcgr

Article 3 - clemens threw a bat, fox dropped the ball
major league baseball's viewpoint was not pursued. ed goren, the president of fox sports, said that past practice dictated that top baseball officials would not comment on such an incident in the middle of the game -- or even at the end. keith olbermann, fox's on-site reporter, nonetheless walked over to bud selig, baseball's commissioner, seated behind home plate, who said he didn't think the clemens incident required immediate attention because it was quelled so quickly and the mets did not demand clemens's immediate ejection. olbermann relayed the comments to mike weisman, the game's producer, who said there was no need to report selig's words. wrong. hurling a jagged bat shard within 2 feet of piazza demanded an on-camera response from selig, even a noncommittal one. selig was obligated to respond. but olbermann didn't ask him to speak on the air and weisman was too underwhelmed to interrupt any play by play. by game's end, here was a chance to talk to selig or frank robinson, baseball's disciplinarian. but goren said he only cared to get clemens.

posada suggested a changeup, and quantrill politely declined. ''i told him i had thought about it, too, but i'm going to make him hit my sinker,'' quantrill said. ''that's my pitch.'' quantrill tried another sinker, but the pitch stayed up in the strike zone, a dangerous spot for a ground-ball pitcher. ''that was the poorest pitch i made,'' quantrill said. but it was inside, at least, and hall could only punch it to center field, where kenny lofton corralled it for the final out. it was the 47th appearance of the season for quantrill, the most in the american league, and torre has taken to him from the start. ''he's pretty remarkable in the way he can pitch in any situation and change speeds with the ball,'' torre said. torre has appeared less certain about what to do with lofton, who has not seemed to fit from the moment he signed with the yankees last winter. lofton was a center fielder on a team that already had one, a pesky leadoff man for a lineup built on power. he was also prone to injury and well past his prime. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive

''it was big, period,'' nelson said. ''no matter what happened the other day or not. i wanted to get out of that inning and get us back.'' in game 1 of the series, torre sent umpires to the mound to check the cap of reliever mike timlin, who has not allowed a run for the red sox in six appearances this postseason. nelson said he figured the move was a show of gamesmanship by the red sox. ''we just got some indication that we saw a little something out there,'' boston manager grady little said. ''we didn't know, but we appreciated the umpires going to check.'' the move surprised torre, who said: ''i guess they wanted to undress him to see if he had anything to doctor the ball. i have no idea what it was.'' nelson said he had never been checked before. ''i'm glad that i don't do anything because i would have had a rough few days being called an attacker and a cheater, two things that i've never been in my life,'' he said. the yankees' bullpen has been the focal point of controversy the last few days, but nelson pointed out that the bullpen itself is well sheltered from the rest of the ballpark. that kept him from the wrath of boston fans until he rose to warm up in the eighth. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking

Article 6 - in getting stars to backpedal, yankees make point
cashman has been more visible since the death of george steinbrenner — scaling a skyscraper dressed as santa’s elf, tending bar for charity while wearing a wig — and more transparent. and he is not afraid to hurt players’ feelings by saying what he really feels. fans should be thankful for that. candor is a good thing, even in a tricky case like this, when the yankees surely irked their captain, derek jeter, by making public their disapproval of his comments sunday night. jeter supported posada, which was no surprise considering their long friendship. jeter said posada was like a brother to him, a significant statement for jeter, who has a sister and no other siblings. yet by offering support, and saying that posada did not need to apologize, jeter was tacitly condoning his refusal to play. photo “i ain’t lying to you,” jeter said. “if i thought he did something wrong, i would tell him.” maybe, by now, jeter has. the yankees’ top executives — the general partner hal steinbrenner, the president randy levine and cashman — summoned jeter to a conference call on monday. they did not offer details of the conversation, but they presumably told jeter everything they knew about what posada did. jeter did not reiterate his support for posada when he spoke with reporters monday at tropicana field. he

Article 7 - david ortiz is ready to trot away
more than anyone, perhaps, ortiz helped lift the cloud of doom that once shrouded his franchise. and his defiant, televised speech in 2013, before the first game at fenway park after the boston marathon bombings, was a moment of triumph for the city. nobody minded his profanity; that’s just big papi. “only he gets away with that,” manager john farrell said, laughing at the memory. “nobody knew what he was going to say, even us in uniform. he grabs the microphone and just naturally comes off with names and thanks different people and talks to the crowd about what we should remember and not forget. and then basically saying what our city is — unscripted, as authentic as can be — maybe that’s one reason why the f.c.c. let it slide.” advertisement continue reading the main story ortiz has raised millions of dollars through his foundation to help children with critical medical needs in new england and his native dominican republic. last tuesday in baltimore, he accepted a bag of cookies from one fan, signed a lithograph for another and lifted a young boy into the dugout for a photo. adrian beltre, the star third baseman for the texas rangers, who played one season with ortiz in boston, grew up about five miles from him in the dominican republic. if the rangers cannot win the pennant, beltre said, he will root for his friend. “he

Article 8 - for diamondbacks, winning is child’s play
on sunday, the suns drew a crowd of 18,422 for game 4 of their first-round playoff series against the san antonio spurs. next door at chase field the next day, 19,868 fans saw pitcher dan haren, the diamondbacks’ prized off-season acquisition from oakland, improve to 4-1. the diamondbacks read reports from new york that fans were booing the mets, and it seemed inconceivable, as made up as a supermarket tabloid story about a 600-pound baby. while dressing before tuesday’s game, diamondbacks outfielder eric byrnes kept an eye on the flat-screen television near his locker, which was tuned to the mets’ game against the pirates. the scene at shea stadium seemed so far away, it was as if the game was being beamed from another planet. “boos? i can’t remember ever getting booed here,” byrnes said. byrnes, 32 and in his third season with the team, is the face of the diamondbacks, but not the way david wright is with the mets. he is a mascot out of the mold of mad magazine’s alfred e. neuman. what, byrnes worry? he is famous here for his bird’s nest hairdo and for not wearing underwear. he has his own television show on a local cable sports network and generally comes across as such a goofball that it is

Article 9 - randolph’s sling is no match for martin’s cast
a clumsy, almost slapstick, barroom fight with one of his own pitchers, eddie lee whitson, left martin with a broken arm and two cracked ribs. when the fight was over, martin acknowledged that whitson had won the brawl, on a technicality. the morning after, as he dictated that day’s batting order to the hitting coach lou piniella because he could not write it himself, billy said: “i was punching. but he was kicking. i can’t fight feet.” martin’s legacy is being revived lately in the espn series “the bronx is burning,” and while monday’s first episode aptly chronicled martin’s paranoia and troubled lifestyle, it has not captured martin’s likeability. martin’s underdog-makes-good story and his evident vulnerability made him immensely popular. he could also be charming and generous. but as randolph recently said of martin, who was one of his early mentors, “he could be crazy, man.” randolph, who will have his arm in a sling tonight as he recovers from routine shoulder surgery, was the second baseman on the yankees’ 1985 team. quiet and not seen out at night much, randolph was not in the baltimore hotel bar after midnight when the fight started and spilled from the barroom to the hotel lobby to the hotel parking lot and eventually into a third-floor hotel corridor. it was actually the second incident in two days for martin. the night before, in the

Article 10 - encouraging debut and frustrating loss for yankees
teixeira’s injury news, the loss to toronto and a disputed play at the plate were among the negatives for the yankees on saturday. but in pineda’s outing there was solace. using a fastball that was regularly clocked from 93 to 95 miles per hour and a nasty slider, pineda mostly dominated the blue jays, showing glimpses of the form he exhibited with the seattle mariners as a rookie in 2011, when he was named to the american league all-star team. in his first appearance since sept. 21 of that year, pineda allowed only one run and five hits over six innings, walked none and struck out five. photo “he was great,” catcher francisco cervelli said. “i cannot ask for anything else.” actually, cervelli might have asked for a different ruling on a close call at the plate with the yankees trailing, 1-0, in the third inning. cervelli was tagged out by blue jays catcher josh thole, but manager joe girardi argued that under the new rules intended to limit collisions at home, thole did not give cervelli a lane to the plate. the umpires decided to review the play on their own, and the out call was confirmed. girardi refrained from an angry outburst, acknowledging that the call was a difficult one for umpires. but he also said that the yankees were told before the season that the

Title: girardi in verbal tussle with red sox base coach
Content: photo the storied rivalry between the yankees and the red sox has included more than a century of fights and feuds. the latest skirmish was a verbal tussle on monday night between yankees manager joe girardi and tim bogar, boston’s first-base coach. as phil hughes pitched in the fourth inning, girardi walked from one end of the first-base dugout to the other so he was within shouting distance of bogar. girardi then shouted at bogar. bogar yelled back. while neither man would discuss the reason for their exchange, girardi was probably accusing bogar of tipping off the catcher’s signs or the pitch location to the batter. with the right-handed-hitting kevin youkilis at the plate, bogar could have had seen catcher jose molina’s signals. “i’m not going to comment,” girardi said. “baseball men being baseball men. it was something i thought i saw.” advertisement continue reading the main story bogar, a former met who said he did not know girardi personally, said he had no previous history with girardi and was unsure why girardi confronted him.

The emotional outburst came after Girardi was asked about the significance of Rodriguez's farewell performance. ""I know how much he loves this game, and I feel for him,"" Girardi said, his voice trembling.

Rodriguez, who played his final game at third base, expressed gratitude to Girardi for allowing him to play in his old position. The two had been at odds earlier in the week, but Rodriguez absolved Girardi of any blame, saying he was ""forever grateful"" for the opportunity.

The Yankees' victory marked a milestone in their rivalry with the Red Sox, who have struggled to find success against their arch-rivals. The teams have a long history, dating back to 1910, and the Yankees hold an edge in the series, having won 18 of the past 29 meetings.

In other news, pitcher Mike Pineda dominated his first outing since September, allowing only one run over six innings. Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks' Dan Haren improved to 4-1, with fans seemingly unaware of the controversy surrounding the Mets' recent struggles.

Tensions Run High in Chicago Cubs Dugout

The Chicago Cubs' recent win over the White Sox was marred by a heated discussion between pitcher John Lackey and first baseman Anthony Rizzo. According to sources, the two had a brief, animated exchange in the dugout after Lackey gave up a two-out, two-run double in the second inning.

Rizzo's teammate, Addison Russell, described the incident as ""over almost as quickly as it began."" However, the tension between the two players was palpable, with some speculating that the discussion may have been related to Rizzo's demotion to a full-time designated hitter role last season.

The Cubs' win marked a turning point in their four-game series against the White Sox. The team had dropped Game 1 earlier in the week, but bounced back behind Willson Contreras' three-run homer in the first inning.

In other news, Yankees manager Joe Girardi has been impressed with the performance of rookie pitcher Michael Pineda. According to sources, Pineda's fastball and slider have been particularly effective, earning praise from CC Sabathia.

Meanwhile, Phillies fan Scott Scuffed is calling for a change in the way pitchers are treated in baseball. In an interview, he expressed frustration with the lack of accountability for pitchers who scuff the ball, citing examples of pitchers who have gotten away with this behavior.

The Yankees' recent signing of Brian McCann has also sparked debate among fans and pundits. While some

Both articles focus on the 2004 presidential election, specifically Senator John Kerry's stance on voting rights and his decision not to participate in a possible protest by Democrats challenging President Bush's victory in Ohio. The language and tone of both articles are formal and objective, indicating that they are likely from reputable news sources. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE is more sensationalized and includes speculative information about potential vice presidential picks for Donald Trump, which is not present in the original article.","Election Controversies and Uncertainties

The 2016 US presidential election has been marred by controversy, with many questioning the legitimacy of the outcome. In a speech at Gettysburg, Donald Trump highlighted concerns about vote fraud, sparking debate among politicians and pundits.

Meanwhile, in Congress, Republicans are facing pressure to pass a healthcare bill, or risk losing their seats in 2018. President Trump warned lawmakers that failure to pass the bill could lead to embarrassment and even primary challenges.

In the world of politics, speculation is rife about potential vice presidential picks for Donald Trump. Carson, Rubio, Cruz, and Christie are among those considered for the role.

However, not everyone is convinced about the outcome of the election. A Harvard University law professor has suggested that up to 20 Republican electors may vote against Trump, citing the US Constitution's provision for independent judgement.

In a surprising twist, some Republicans have expressed concerns about their party's chances in the midterms. The Independent Sentinel predicts a Democratic victory in the Senate and House of Representatives, while others believe the GOP will lose seats but not gain enough to make a difference.

As the country prepares for the midterms, many are focusing on the significance of the election. Charles Krauthammer describes it as ""an election about everything,"" with implications for government size, rule of law, security, and more.

In Wisconsin, a recall election has sparked controversy over exit polls that suggested President Obama was leading in the vote count. MSNBC declared Obama the winner, but CNN reported that the election was essentially tied between Walker and Barrett.

The midterms will undoubtedly shape the future of the country, with many seeing it as a referendum on the current administration's policies and scandals. As one commentator noted, ""it's about time"" for Americans to hold their leaders accountable.","As the 2004 presidential election approaches, several candidates are vying for the Democratic nomination. Senator John Edwards has announced his candidacy, promising to champion the cause of regular people and criticizing President Bush's administration as being controlled by insiders.

Meanwhile, the Republican Party is facing challenges from within its own ranks. Some Republicans are questioning the party's stance on issues like immigration and gun control, which have been contentious topics in recent years.

In other news, the debate teams for the upcoming presidential debates are finalizing their negotiations. The bipartisan commission has stated that it will not negotiate its selections of moderators, locations, and dates, but some negotiators have a history of tangling.

The issue of stem-cell research is also gaining attention, with Senator John Kerry vowing to lift Bush's limits on funding for the research. Kerry has cited Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of national laboratories and Bill Clinton's support for mapping the human genome as examples of his commitment to science and technology.

In a related development, some Democrats are expressing concerns about the potential impact of President-elect Trump's policies on the judiciary. Several senators have called for a broader inquiry into election hacking, citing the need for comprehensive recommendations and new legislation to modernize the nation's laws and practices.

As the election season heats up, candidates are facing increasing scrutiny from voters and pundits alike. With the first debates just around the corner, it remains to be seen how these issues will shape the campaign and ultimately determine the next President of the United States.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 2 - trump warns republicans ahead of healthcare vote.
president trump issued a stern warning on tuesday, telling republicans they could lose their seats — and the house majority — in 2018 if they fail to repeal and replace obamacare, gop sources said. during a closed-door meeting in the basement of the capitol, trump told rank-and-file house republicans if the party is not successful in passing its healthcare bill, “i believe many of you will lose in 2018,” according to a source in the room. “he told us if we don’t pass this bill on thursday, it will put everything in jeopardy that he wants to do, his agenda,” rep. john duncan (r-tenn.) told the hill as he left the meeting. advertisement the house is slated to vote on the american health care act on thursday. if it passes, it will head to the senate, where it faces a tougher road. trump’s visit to capitol hill was billed as a rally for the healthcare bill, just two days before the historic vote to roll back president obama’s signature domestic achievement. but the gathering took on a darker tone. the president told lawmakers a failed vote would be embarrassing to the party and could result in members facing primary challengers and republicans losing the house, sources said. and trump singled out freedom caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.), a trump ally during the presidential campaign who has vowed his conservative group has enough votes to block the legislation. as trump addressed the chairman

Article 4 - a shocking number of gop electors have just agreed to vote against trump despite voters’ wishes
a harvard university law professor contends that there are at least 20 republican members of the electoral college who are willing to vote against donald trump in an attempt to prevent him from becoming president of the united states. professor larry lessig has been offering legal support to electors on their right to “vote their conscience,” reports the independent. he says the u.s. constitution allows the electors to “exercise their independent and nonpartisan judgement about who to vote for.” the electoral college takes place five weeks after the election. its 538 electors — one for each congressional district, plus two for the senate seats — cast their ballots on dec. 19. they are counted on jan. 6, at which time the election results become official. however, about half the states do not bind their electors to the winning candidate, enabling so-called “faithless electors” to vote for someone else if they choose. so far only one republican elector, chris suprun of texas, has publicly declared his intention to be a faithless elector, saying he will not vote for trump because he is unqualified to be president. but lessig believes suprun is far from alone. “surveying the three groups that are supporting republican electors, we believe there are 20 right now — some tell me the number is higher than that, it should be more like 30 — but i feel confident in saying there’s at least 20,” he said in a

bush declares 'mission accomplished', claims presidency despite the fact that not even half of the total votes in the country have been counted as of 10:15 pm est, president bush has announced that his ""mission"" -- that of returning to the white house for the next four years -- is ""accomplished"". ""i am happy to announce that democracy has prevailed,"" he said, standing on top of air force one, which in turn was on top of an air craft carrier, as eagles and doves flew around his face and a heavenly spotlight illuminated his face. ""on this day, at this time, democracy was put to the test in the united states. and it worked."" bush went on to explain that he never had any doubts about his eventual win. ""having a democracy is a lot harder than having a dictatorship, because there are all kinds of pesky 'choices' that can confuse people,"" he said. ""luckily, the people of the united states have chosen correctly. they were close to having an unprecedented reign of terror with john kerry, but that crisis has been averted. the united states is free once more."" the kerry campaign, meanwhile, has protested against the early announcement of victory, claiming that it could hamper potential kerry voters in the west, where polls have not yet closed. ""our research shows that at least seven million people in the west bring pocket televisions with them to the polls, so that they can watch the results

Article 6 - whining in foxholes won’t win back america
in 2004, amid pressure for an unpopular war in iraq that wasn’t going so well, then defense secretary donald rumsfeld said, “as you know, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time.” on december 12 of this year, alabama voters will decide who will fill the us senate seat formerly occupied by attorney general jeff sessions. the two, major candidates are republican roy moore and democrat doug jones. this isn’t a binary choice, as our great and wise leaders repeatedly chant. voters can choose moore, jones, libertarian ron bishop, or independent arlester mcbride. they can also write in their preferred candidate or abstain from voting. unlike exiting arizona senator jeff flake, who said he would vote for doug jones, well-intentioned and thoughtful conservatives like ben shapiro and matt walsh are in the abstention camp. they rightly recoil at the allegations that roy moore sexually assaulted young girls, one as young as 14. some on the right call moore a pedophile, which is not accurate even if the story of him fondling the 14-year-old is true, since pedophilia concerns pre-pubescent children. it’s morally reprehensible and illegal, but it’s not pedophilia. so, whom do we support? my fellow americans, we are at war – in the

Article 7 - barack obama not popular regardless of polling
barack obama not popular regardless of polling (before it's news) first there is only one poll that counts during any election cycle and that is the one that takes place on election day when the final results are in and a winner is declared whether it’s a presidential election or any other office. polls are regularly skewed and the numbers are a result of a lack of ideological balance in the polling sample. most of the polling leans left with the polling balance having more proclaimed democrats than republicans or independents. also much of the polling consists of either an across the board sample of people who may or may not vote or registered voters rather than what are considered likely voters who will actually take the time and effort to head to the polls on election day and cast a vote. with all that said recent polling shows obama with a slight lead in battleground states and on most national polling. don’t believe it or let it cause discouragement in thinking that he is a shoe in on november 6th when americans vote for president. there are several indications of obama’s complete lack of popularity that speak volumes and are much more revealing then skewed polling. mitt romney has out raised obama for the last two months, may and june and not by just a small amount but a significant amount of campaign cash. in fact obama has been forced to seek donations over seas from european support in order to find money to support his struggling campaign because americans are not financially supporting him. this in itself

(before it's news) every week on monday morning , the council and our invited guests weigh in at the watcher’s forum, short takes on a major issue of the day, the culture, or daily living. this week’s question:what’s your prediction for the house and senate midterms? the independent sentinel : i honestly have no idea. we don’t have the enthusiasm of 2010 that the promise of the tea party brought to the table. i think we will take the senate and keep the house but i’m not counting on it. if we do, it will be because the democrats are that bad and not because the republicans offered much. the razor :the gop has discovered the palestinian talent of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. the midterms is theirs to lose – which means they’ll probably lose them by keeping the house but not gaining enough seats in the senate to make a difference. still i had to give kudos to al franken’s challenger in mn for calling the senate “land of 10,000 excuses.” franken wasn’t funny on saturday night live but his performance there was much better than his performance has been in the senate. joshuapundit: i’d say the house remains here it is, assuming things stay pretty much as they are for the next 90 days.the gop at best might pick up a couple of seats –

-----------------
Article 1 - take back the house, democrats. please.
it is difficult to overstate the threat that mr. trump poses for down-ballot candidates. across party lines, high-ranking current and former government officials view him as lacking the temperament, character, judgment and experience required of a president. polls suggest that this assessment is also widely shared by ordinary voters. although vocal minorities have held similar views about presidential candidates in the past, the current situation is without precedent. the ads for democratic opponents of republican incumbents virtually write themselves. john plumb, who’s challenging my own congressman, the trump supporter and tea party republican tom reed, might consider an ad like the following: “in a briefing on nuclear weapons with a foreign policy expert, donald trump repeatedly asked, ‘if we have them, why can’t we use them?’ tom reed wants to entrust this man with the nuclear codes.” an actual ad emphasizing the lack of daylight between her opponent’s positions and those of mr. trump, made by luann bennett, who is challenging barbara comstock, a republican in virginia’s 10th district, further illustrates mr. trump’s potential to haunt down-ballot candidates. since many potentially vulnerable republican congressional seats are in safely blue states like california and new york, a serious effort to end republican majorities would of course require expenditures that will have no impact on the electoral college vote. in the standard way of thinking about trade-offs like these, it would be rational to tolerate a slight increase in the risk of losing the

Article 2 - one bruising scenario for clinton
how could that happen? first of all, mrs. clinton not only has to win pennsylvania on april 22, she has to swamp mr. obama there. and she has to go on and post a convincing win against mr. obama in indiana, a state where the two appear evenly matched. results like those would serve to underscore concerns among some democrats that arose after mrs. clinton had beaten mr. obama in ohio, suggesting he was having trouble getting blue-collar white voters into his column. it is one constituency that aides to mr. mccain see very much in play this fall. along the same lines, mrs. clinton would get some wind if she trounces mr. obama in the june 3 contest in puerto rico. mr. obama has had trouble in competing for latino voters. and that has been duly noted by mr. mccain’s aides who said they are beginning to see a general election upside — among hispanic voters in a contest against mr. obama — to the problems that mr. mccain’s support of immigration legislation caused him in the primaries. (that is one reason why the endorsement that mr. obama won last week from gov. bill richardson of new mexico, who is one of the country’s leading elected hispanic officials, had significance going far beyond the democratic nominating contest). newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box

Article 3 - campaigns enlist big names to set debates' details
for all their negotiating talent, the debate teams are likely to be able to affect only so much. the bipartisan commission has said it will not negotiate its selections of moderators, locations and dates, meaning that except for a few issues like how many debates the candidates will actually participate in, the assembled power brokers could spend much of their time arguing over camera angles and lighting. but some of the negotiators have a history of tangling. less than four years ago, mr. baker was running the bush recount operation in florida, while ron klain, who is helping mr. kerry's team, was a leader of al gore's florida operation. now they are facing off again -- with the outcome, perhaps, likewise hanging in the balance. that may sound like hyperbole. but that might be the point. members of both parties and outside experts agree that the predebate debates have become so sophisticated that the naming of the debate negotiation teams has turned into an end in itself, becoming the first phase in a dance, expected to last days, in which the campaigns try to gain leverage over each other while setting expectations for the public. mr. kerry named the leader of his team, mr. jordan, a close friend of former president bill clinton, back in june, as a way to show he was ready to debate whenever mr. bush was. mr. bush, on the other hand, did not name his team until this week, a signal that he will take his

Article 5 - kerry vows to lift bush limits on stem-cell research
''presidents are supposed to think big and dream big and help our nation to do so,'' he said, citing franklin d. roosevelt's creation of the national laboratories, john f. kennedy's commitment to put a man on the moon, and bill clinton's support for mapping the human genome. ''when america sees a problem or a possibility of greatness, it is in our collective character to set our sights on the horizon and not stop working until we get there,'' mr. kerry said. on monday night, mr. kerry decided to upend his schedule, canceling a fund-raiser and speech on tuesday in new mexico to allow him to fly back to washington overnight for a possible vote on an amendment to make health care financing for veterans mandatory. mr. kerry has rarely interrupted his campaign activities for senate business, but veterans' health care is a signature issue in his campaign. burton richter, who received the nobel in physics in 1976 for discovering a subatomic particle and who helped mr. kerry's campaign collect his colleagues' support over the last 10 days, told reporters that ''nobel laureates tend not to use their names for anything outside of science,'' adding, ''i hope you take that as a sign of how seriously all of us think the errors of our present course are.'' mr. kerry's speech, beginning a week focused on science and technology, was his first public appearance in colorado, a

Article 6 - bradley hit by questions raised by mccain's success
''i would feel like such a traitor voting republican,'' said ms. utting, a former university administrator who was wearing a ''retired peace corps volunteer'' sweatshirt. ''but i may have to do it.'' at mr. bradley's first two events he drew large crowds, but they were more polite than enthusiastic, in contrast to the raucous adoration of mr. mccain's audiences when he visited washington on wednesday. mr. bradley spent his day blasting vice president al gore's record on education, gun control and the environment, making appeals to students and liberal voters and answering questions about mr. mccain. in democratic strongholds in seattle, tacoma and olympia, mr. bradley asserted that mr. gore remained a conservative democrat at heart who would spend more on the military than on education and who lacked the leadership skills to enact sweeping legislation on gun control, health care and campaign finance reform. ''now that he's on his own running, what do we see?'' mr. bradley asked more than 300 people at the university of washington in seattle. ''more new money on military buildup than on education, even in this post-cold-war moment. i don't get it. what is the greater need today? missiles, tanks, or a qualified teacher in every classroom?'' mr. bradley's decision to invest so much of his time, money and staff on washington, which holds a

Article 8 - senator edwards enters race for president
senator john edwards of north carolina said yesterday that he intended to run for president in 2004, promising that he would ''champion the cause of regular people,'' while harshly condemning president bush's white house as being ''run for the benefit of insiders.'' mr. edwards used nearly identical language setting out a notably populist theme for his candidacy in a choreographed succession of interviews throughout the day, beginning with an appearance on a morning news program. it was, right down to its language, evocative of the campaign theme used by the last successful democratic candidate for president, bill clinton. ''if i am the nominee of the democrats in 2004, what i will be is somebody who champions the cause of regular people,'' mr. edwards, 49, said in a telephone interview from raleigh, n.c. ''not insiders, regular people -- people who don't have lobbyists.'' asked if he was drawing a contrast with the current white house, mr. edwards, a personal injury lawyer, responded with a burst of criticism of mr. bush. advertisement continue reading the main story ''i don't think president bush represents that,'' he said.

Article 9 - glum democrats can't see halting bush on courts
republicans rejected democratic assertions that judge alito was out of the mainstream. ""the american people see judge alito and say, that's exactly the sort of person we want to see on the supreme court,"" said steve schmidt, the white house official who managed the nomination. now,, several democrats said, even at a time when many of his other initiatives seem in doubt, and though he was forced by conservatives to withdraw his first choice for the seat, mr. bush appears on the verge of achieving what he had set as a primary goal of his presidency: a fundamental reshaping of the federal judiciary along more conservative lines. mr. bush has now appointed one-quarter of the federal appeals court judges, and, assuming that judge alito is confirmed -- the judiciary committee vote is expected to occur in the next 10 days -- will have put two self-described conservatives on a supreme court that has only two members appointed by a democratic president. ""they have made a lot of progress,"" said ronald a. klain, a former democratic chief counsel for the judiciary committee and the white house counsel in charge of judicial nominations for president bill clinton.

mr. mcconnell said last week that while he respects the intelligence agencies’ conclusions, the senate intelligence committee is “more than capable of conducting a complete review” itself. he also acknowledged that mr. mccain could conduct an investigation on the armed services committee, an option that remains open should mr. mcconnell decide against a select committee. those divisions, coming as the electoral college prepares to meet on monday to ratify mr. trump’s election and the president-elect completes his cabinet choices, all but ensured that the issue would cloud the first months of mr. trump’s presidency, when he will be asking congress to approve an aggressive legislative agenda. several permanent congressional committees have already been tasked with examining various aspects of the russian interference, which has been largely accepted as fact by most members of congress. but in their letter on sunday, the lawmakers argued the issue was too important and complicated for an existing committee to take on properly. “we share your respect for, and deference to, the regular order of the senate, and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request,” the senators wrote to mr. mcconnell. “however, we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem.” in addition to undertaking a “comprehensive investigation of russian interference,” the senators recommended that such a committee also develop “comprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation’s laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge.” select committees,

Election Controversies and Uncertainties

The 2016 US presidential election has been marred by controversy, with many questioning the legitimacy of the outcome. In a speech at Gettysburg, Donald Trump highlighted concerns about vote fraud, sparking debate among politicians and pundits.

Meanwhile, in Congress, Republicans are facing pressure to pass a healthcare bill, or risk losing their seats in 2018. President Trump warned lawmakers that failure to pass the bill could lead to embarrassment and even primary challenges.

In the world of politics, speculation is rife about potential vice presidential picks for Donald Trump. Carson, Rubio, Cruz, and Christie are among those considered for the role.

However, not everyone is convinced about the outcome of the election. A Harvard University law professor has suggested that up to 20 Republican electors may vote against Trump, citing the US Constitution's provision for independent judgement.

In a surprising twist, some Republicans have expressed concerns about their party's chances in the midterms. The Independent Sentinel predicts a Democratic victory in the Senate and House of Representatives, while others believe the GOP will lose seats but not gain enough to make a difference.

As the country prepares for the midterms, many are focusing on the significance of the election. Charles Krauthammer describes it as ""an election about everything,"" with implications for government size, rule of law, security, and more.

In Wisconsin, a recall election has sparked controversy over exit polls that suggested President Obama was leading in the vote count

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE

As the 2004 presidential election approaches, several candidates are vying for the Democratic nomination. Senator John Edwards has announced his candidacy, promising to champion the cause of regular people and criticizing President Bush's administration as being controlled by insiders.

Meanwhile, the Republican Party is facing challenges from within its own ranks. Some Republicans are questioning the party's stance on issues like immigration and gun control, which have been contentious topics in recent years.

In other news, the debate teams for the upcoming presidential debates are finalizing their negotiations. The bipartisan commission has stated that it will not negotiate its selections of moderators, locations, and dates, but some negotiators have a history of tangling.

The issue of stem-cell research is also gaining attention, with Senator John Kerry vowing to lift Bush's limits on funding for the research. Kerry has cited Franklin D. Roosevelt's creation of national laboratories and Bill Clinton's support for mapping the human genome as examples of his commitment to science and technology.

In a related development, some Democrats are expressing concerns about the potential impact of President-elect Trump's policies on the judiciary. Several senators have called for a broader inquiry into election hacking, citing the need for comprehensive recommendations and new legislation to modernize the nation's laws and practices.

As the election season heats up, candidates are facing increasing scrutiny from voters and pundits alike. With the first debates just around the corner, it remains to be seen how these issues will shape the campaign and ultimately determine the next President of the United States.

Article 6 - have you been endorsed?
have you been endorsed?

In contrast, some sports apparel has been criticized for its lack of environmental consideration. A recent Olympic kit design has sparked debate about the use of synthetic fabrics and manufacturing processes.

Meanwhile, in the world of footwear, a new study has shed light on the unique stride of humans when walking. Researchers have found that our heel-to-toe gait is distinct from other animals, with implications for barefoot running and walking techniques.

A pair of stylish rosewood sofas with dramatically outward-sloping upholstered arms and bold, leafy carving were on display, highlighting the inventiveness and virtuosity of Indian artisans.

Meanwhile, in New York, a series of fairy houses appeared along the Rahway Trail in Locust Grove, drawing visitors from surrounding towns. The tiny homes, crafted from natural materials such as acorns, twigs, and moss, seemed to be the work of one person, but their creator remained unknown.

In the world of furniture design, convertible pieces have been around for centuries, with 18th-century military men traveling with versatile furnishings that could be broken down and reassembled. More recently, designers have created sophisticated convertible children's furniture, such as a crib that converts to a desk.

On Bowery, cultures clash as old and new meet in unexpected ways. The Prince Hotel, once a flophouse for the fallen princes of the city, has been transformed into a gentrified hangout for hipsters. Meanwhile, Donna Hanover is creating her first home as a single working mother, blending modern style with comfort and livability.

In Tokyo, Ballantyne Cashmere's new flagship store features a unique blend of styles, from tropical prints to minimalist decor. The brand's summer sweaters are paired with bold, colorful accents, while the interior designer has incorporated whimsical touches, such as a screen door designed without a screen.

hybrid chairs inspired by ancient mythology by merve kahraman (before it's news) the art when mixed with the feelings and nave then creates a lovely and awesome art fact. the talented designer kahraman merve (merve kahraman) has created an exclusive collection of glasses for the elite. not everyone will appreciate; few take advantage of, but those who are still lucky enough to remember this event for a long time. equally memorable is the original and a series of designer chairs by this author, called hybrid chairs. and one need only look to see why it is termed so. series hybrid chairs are very concise and comfortable. it consists of two chairs, hybrids, deer and a white rabbit. the idea was born zoomorphic chairs and the author was inspired by ancient mythology that it inspired the myth of half-human, and chairs have become a kind of hybrid method to combine into one man and beast in real life. a chair-chair-deer and rabbit is handmade furniture, made from durable, high-quality wood, leather and wool and is totally lovely. while trying to make them as close as possible to the animals, the designer has provided not only the decor items such as antlers and bunny ears – legs and arms of unusual chairs which look the same as that of the four-legged “sitters.” for example, a chair, deer stands firmly on the legs, “decorated” their hooves, and a chair-rabbit – a neat rabbit’s feet

Article 4 - sign cutting and tracking methods employed by the us border patrol
sign cutting and tracking methods employed by the us border patrol (before it's news) source: its tactical (lots of pictures in the article below) “there’s always sign.” sign is the physical evidence of any disturbance of the environment left behind by animals, humans or objects. the detection of this sign is called sign cutting. a person (or animal) cannot traverse ground without leaving some sort of telltale sign. this sign is what we’re trying to find and track. when most people think of tracking, they usually think of following footprints. but a trained tracker looks for more. he looks for kicked-over rocks, soil depressions, clothing fibers, changes in vegetation, changes in the environment, ambient noise or lack thereof, etc. basically, the tracker looks for the disturbance — the sign — left behind by the person or persons being tracked. origin sign cutting and tracking has been around for millennia. it is a natural extension of hunting, both animals and people. on our continent, native americans perfected the art of sign cutting tracking both men and animals. to this day, there are special units of native american law enforcement trackers protecting this nation. many other rescue and law enforcement entities in the united states use tracking to locate people. today, the tradition of tracking persons for law enforcement purposes is usually associated with the men and women of the united states border patrol. the u.s. border patrol currently trains its agents in sign cutting, and even after the adoption of modern technology,

sorri chair is wide on wood-crafted joinery and aesthetics (before it's news) face it, your bottom is tired of the cushy, padded seat, proper proportions and adjustable arms, back, legs, height, tension, spin and depth. yes, your ass longs for simplicity. the sorri lounge chair is a ultra-minimal and ,may i say, ultra-fantastico chair designed by portugal-based designer gonçalo campos. it’s produced by wewood and while it’s not available for sale yet, the joinery and the form is a site to behold. sorri chair typically, we’re opposed to simply posting inspirational end-product shots of a fabulous design. there’s just so much work that goes into an idea. (note to designers: post video and images of the process! show what it takes! example.) even with the lack of bandsaws and sawdust covered faces, gonçalo was kind enough to share some very detailed shots of the exquisite joinery that compliments the frame of this chair and balances the massive surfaces of flowing grain in the seat and chair back. apparently, it’s a ‘friendly’ chair as well. “‘sorri’ is a friendly chair, ingenious, wide and inviting. easily recognized by those great gentle surfaces–an important feature that provides all of the comfort, with a wide area to drop belongings like a bag, a coat or a book. many design details were considered in this chair

Article 9 - human heel to toe stride finally explained through treadmill study
human heel to toe stride finally explained through treadmill study (before it's news) it’s something so fundamental it can seem arbitrary, but the strides we take when walking are actually unique in the animal kingdom. many animals, such as cats and dogs, get around on the balls of their feet, while humans have a clear heel to toe stride. james webber, a barefoot running enthusiast and doctoral student at the university of arizona school of anthropology, has been researching the ways humans run and walk over the past few years. his latest study, published in the journal of experimental biology, explains why human’s walk the way they do humans are very much set in the way they walk, something which obscures the fact that our stride is actually pretty curious. to webber it is a particularly pertinent issue. barefoot runners run in a way that sees them land on the middle or balls of their feet instead of their heels, a stride which would feel unnatural when walking. “humans are very efficient walkers, and a key component of being an efficient walker in all kinds of mammals is having long legs,” webber explains in a press release from the university of arizona. “cats and dogs are up on the balls of their feet, with their heel elevated up in the air, so they’ve adapted to have a longer leg, but humans have done something different. we’ve dropped our heels down on the ground, which physically makes our legs shorter than they could be if we were up on

Article 10 - whatever happened to: rugby boots?
whatever happened to: rugby boots? (before it's news) back in the mists of time life was very simple for rugby players, especially when it came to choice of footwear. if you were a forward you bought a pair of solid, ankle-high boots with a hard toe-cap. if you were a girl back you wore lower-cut footie-style boots. and, whatever your positional disposition, your boots were unashamedly black. these days, of course, all has changed. white boots, red boots, silver boots, luminous yellow boots…the choice is endless. even the all blacks are at it (although i suppose they can be excused on the basis that if you are going to wear coloured boots then you’d better be bloody good). it is, perhaps, a sign of the times – i.e. a need to draw attention to oneself as part of the cult of the individual rather than as part of the collective (a symptom often associated with haskell’s disease). if so it is somewhat ironic as, such is the plethora of coloured boots on display these days that, as a strategy, it is doomed to failure. and, sadly, i have to admit that, had coloured boots been available when i was in my twenties, i almost certainly have would worn a pair total flanker – the older i get, the better i was read more at total flanker source:

Article 1 - britannia still rules a world of furnishings
at olympia, august röell, a dealer in maastricht, the netherlands, had a pair of stylish rosewood sofas made in mid-19th century india. they had dramatically outward-sloping upholstered arms (for reading or napping) and bold, leafy carving. ''they combine british design with the inventiveness and virtuosity of indian craftsmanship,'' mr. röell said. ''the crests on the back rails are inventively adapted and expanded from splat designs of british chairs of about 1830.'' he said queen noor of jordan had owned the pair but sold them after the death of her husband, king hussein. he is asking $30,800 for the pair. the pair of tall bureau cabinets inlaid with ivory dominated mr. van vredenburgh's booth. they were made in vishakhapatnam, a port on the east coast of india halfway between calcutta and madras that became a center of western-style cabinetmaking with ivory inlay at the end of the 17th century. ''i suspect these two bureau cabinets have always been together,'' mr. van vredenburgh said. ''they may be a his-and-hers set, since one is slightly larger than the other. they were probably made for the european market in the 18th century.'' ivory-inlaid furniture from india has been popular ever since george iii bought some on a whim.

thumbelina’s secret architect, creating fairy houses on a new jersey trail the tiniest homes 8 photos view slide show > image alex wroblewski/the new york times millburn, n.j. — intricate little fairy houses started appearing in the woods of south mountain reservation here about five years ago. they were delicate creations made largely of the natural materials one might find in the woods: a chair seat made of an acorn, a ladder of twigs, a seat back fashioned from a fungus fan, a sofa cushioned with moss. and they mainly dotted a part of the rahway trail in locust grove, a short walk from downtown millburn that draws dog walkers and runners from the surrounding towns. there were 20 to 30 of them, new ones replacing old ones over the years, discreetly tucked in a tree hollow or artfully incorporated into a root. they all had a similar enchanting style and looked like the work of one person, but nobody seemed to know exactly who. “it was like a treasure hunt to find them and exciting and lovely,” said gail waimon, a member of the south mountain conservancy, a volunteer group that maintains and leads hikes through the 2,110-acre nature reserve in essex county. “but this year i noticed the houses multiplying by leaps and bounds,” she said. in the spring, a new breed of fairy house started popping up along the same trail. they were crude by comparison

Article 3 - room to improve
q. i once saw a crib that converted to a bed with a desk, but can’t find it. can you help? a. also known as harlequin, metamorphic and meubles à surprises, convertible furniture has been with us for longer than you might imagine. eighteenth-century military men crossing uncharted lands traveled with amazingly versatile furnishings known as campaign furniture, which could be broken down and reassembled with relative ease, and often had multiple uses. some homeowners in the 18th and 19th centuries even rejoiced in presto-chango oddities like a sofa that folded out of the front of an artificial player piano. sophisticated convertible children’s furniture, however, seems a more recent development, and the crib-to-desk model you describe is an even rarer (but welcome) instance of the genre. perhaps you are remembering the studio crib by truck product architecture. the studio crib, above, was created as part of a four-piece line of children’s furniture introduced this year by nurseryworks, which offers furniture that even a grown-up could covet. made of pale but handsomely striped zebrawood, offset with colorful lacquer (the rails and storage drawer are enameled in citrus, cotton candy, lime, navy, slumber yellow or snow) the studio crib has an adjustable changing tray at one end that flips down. as a child gets older the changing pad can be removed and the tray used as a desk; the hidden storage

Article 4 - on bowery, cultures clash as the shabby meet the shabby chic
here, then, continues the never-ending push and pull between new york’s past and present. those on the second floor — charlie, and ricky, and walter — represent the bowery’s fading days as a boulevard of last resort. those on the upper floors — many of them european, a few of them models — represent the bowery’s growing status as a gentrified hangout for the oh-so-hip. the arrangement recalls “my man godfrey,” a depression-era comedy with a social conscience, in which oblivious socialites race to the city dump to find a “forgotten man” for an elite gathering’s scavenger hunt. better yet, it echoes a distant bowery practice known as slumming, in which gaggles of gilded age gentry would tour its saloons, opium dens and slums, all for that fluttering thrill of there but for the grace of god — and the breaks of privilege and birthright — go i. the prince hotel was built in the late 1920s as just another lodging house for the fallen princes of the city: 54 crammed on the second floor, 74 on the third, 74 on the fourth. around 1950, wooden cubicles were installed, along with a small clerk’s booth on the second floor — a standard flophouse setup. a dozen years ago, joey grill, the co-owner of the click modeling agency, bought the flophouse

''it was a nice workaday apartment, just trying to fit everything in and have livable space,'' ms. hanover said last week while shopping for furniture and finishings with mr. gleicher. ''left to my own devices, i will almost make student choices -- a 'white cabinets and butcher block' kind of thing.'' with the help of mr. gleicher, she is creating her first home as a single working mother, with an adult style of her own, comfort for her family and the capacity to entertain as she did at gracie mansion, with dinners for accomplished women. the apartment is her only residence. she said she had no plans for a second home. wearing a short black dress, a small diamond pendant, an acid-green hacking jacket with a gold race for the cure ribbon pin on its lapel and black high heels, ms. hanover looked at marble and other materials at stone source, a showroom on park avenue south. ''i want a modern look,'' she said. ''not exactly minimal, but not a lot of tchotchkes. i want clean lines.'' the apartment, in a post-world war ii building on a high floor, has good views and light, which she wants to encourage with the new design.

Article 6 - tokyo: ballantyne cashmere
photo brazil meets tehran, and i’m not talking about the world cup. the interior designer nicola quadri chose josef frank’s botanical prints to decorate ballantyne cashmere’s new flagship store in the upscale aoyama district of tokyo. the lighter, cream-based brazil pattern, with its swirl of tropical fruits and flowers, greets customers from behind the two-story glass curtains that front the street. it complements perfectly the scottish label’s range of summer sweaters, in pale greens and cool pastel blues, that hang on display. in one corner of the window sits a white leather settee: a men’s navy blue blazer with bold red and white pinstripes hangs casually over the back, while pairs of red and green canvas shoes are seated next to a white sweater with a muted pink plaid pattern. step inside and your eyes pass over the pale oak floors to the much bolder teheran (as mr. frank spells it) print decorating the rear of the store. the black-based textile with its myriad brightly colored flowers and leaves also adorns the huge teak-framed ottoman that sits next to the only other piece of furniture, an oval oak table. to offset the wildly patterned linen wall coverings, everything else is minimal: from the off-white shelves to arne jacobsen’s moonlike recessed light fittings. downstairs, semicircular walls support shelves with piles of sweaters in a choice of

Article 8 - colonial suffolk life in all its simplicity
one of the exhibition’s text panels uses the phrase “sequestered in a great measure from the world,” which describes one aspect of the lives of colonial residents in suffolk. “they could be insular in some ways,” ms. curran said, “and wealthy and cosmopolitan in other ways. but they were often interested in maintaining their traditions.” although the exhibition displays, for instance, an imported italian pistol with intricate engraving and bronze insets, it also contains more prosaic flintlock muskets used by farmers for hunting and protection. among its furnishings are an elegant william and mary-style oak escritoire with a bonnet top, inlaid drawers and a rich teak veneer. but also on hand are several distinctly unfussy splat-backed chairs as well as a humble cradle used by nathaniel woodhull as an infant and a simple drop-leaf table (upon which local patriots signed the articles of association to show their support for independence). photo “when you take a look at a large body of objects from this period, you get a clear sense that eastern long island was a bit more isolated and remote,” said dean failey, an expert in local art history and senior director at christie’s art auction house in new york. “the people there had access to more fashionable styles, but it didn’t seem to be as important to them.” for richard barons, executive director of the east hampton historical society, this

Article 9 - proving there is no look too expensive to knock off
the 2008 kips bay decorator show house, open through may 22, is a good source of inspiration, even for those on a modest budget. although most of the designers used expensive materials and accessories, an enterprising shopper could adapt many of the looks for a reasonable price. some decorators juxtaposed unexpected styles and materials, pairing a 1960s modern chair with a traditional ottoman, for example, or upholstering a 19th-century french armchair in african cloth. one way to adapt this idea is to combine pieces you already own but never thought of using together, or to forage through thrift shops and yard sales for items from different eras instead of shopping for new ones. 1. rather than hanging a large framed photograph on the wall, s. russell groves displayed it on a 20th-century nickel easel with a light ($6,700 from www.mondomodern.com). a new aluminum display easel without a built-in lamp is a less expensive alternative ($64 from www.easelsdirect.com). 2. olivier giugni, the new york florist, planted a garden of rosemary, sage, lavender and parsley above the sink in a chef's kitchen ($275 for this arrangement in a stainless steel planter, from www.lolivier.com). the salvia 20-inch planter is about $7 at ikea stores, and many garden centers around the country offer pots of herbs for

Article 10 - bjarke ingels on his via 57 chair
this interview has been edited and condensed. q. how is via 57 west different from other apartment buildings? a. the building is about creating that corner, and the courtyard. because of the extreme asymmetry, the southwest corner is the height of a handrail and the northeast corner is the height of a high-rise. the courtyard building is at the architectural scale what central park is at the urban scale — an oasis in the middle of the city. it’s communal. i have a feeling that this building will function a little like a social condenser. it might actually be a building where you get to know your neighbors. q. why design a chair to go with it? a. we thought there would be something fun about doing it for this project. arne jacobsen, the danish architect — some of his nicest work was designed for the royal hotel in copenhagen, including the swan and the egg chair. it was fritz hansen who did that. we came up with this idea of scan-american: if scandinavia is known for this very simple aesthetic, then american, in the cliché way, could be about comfort. our first design was almost the idea of a beanbag chair with skinny legs. q. how did the building inspire it? a. it’s not like we wanted the chair to look like the building, or vice versa. in the courtyard, it’s really open to one side and really well defined to the other side

Designers are pushing the boundaries of creativity and functionality in their work. One such example is a collection of hybrid chairs inspired by ancient mythology, featuring deer and rabbit designs made from durable materials like wood, leather, and wool.

In contrast, some sports apparel has been criticized for its lack of environmental consideration. A recent Olympic kit design has sparked debate about the use of synthetic fabrics and manufacturing processes.

Meanwhile, in the world of footwear, a new study has shed light on the unique stride of humans when walking. Researchers have found that our heel-to-toe gait is distinct from other animals, with implications for barefoot running and walking techniques.

In a year marked by unprecedented disasters, the world has witnessed a series of tragic events that have left families and communities reeling. From the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia to the United States, the past 12 months have seen a staggering number of fatalities and injuries.

A bus carrying 31 passengers flipped over on a highway in Brazil, killing nine people and injuring 20 others. The driver lost control while negotiating a high-risk curve, leaving the vehicle upside down in a ditch.

In the United States, a series of bizarre incidents has left authorities baffled. A man was arrested for driving a motorized barstool under the influence, nearly killing hundreds of people in the process. Another incident saw a group of Black Lives Matter protesters swarm a car, prompting the driver to speed through their roadblock.

In Illinois, a driver hurtled through a group of protesters during a ""Black Lives Matters"" march, leaving one person injured on the hood of his vehicle. Meanwhile, four San Diego-based sailors rescued victims in a head-on collision accident along Nimitz Highway in Honolulu.

The past year has also seen a series of mysterious incidents involving chiropractors. Five doctors have died in accidents in recent months, with three cases involving single-car crashes that left no survivors.

Article 4 - the back of the bus
the back of the bus (before it's news) image = wikipedia by grant davies on this day (-23), – that’s july 16th for you math wizards – in 1944, an african american lady was riding a bus. a white couple boarded along the way and found no seat available. the friendly bus driver offered the black lady’s seat to the white people. however the black lady, who was seated in the “colored” section near the back of the bus refused to move. she explained, “this is my seat, why should i?” the rest is, as we say, history. as to the bus driver, this was a problem he hadn’t encountered before. not knowing what else to do, and sizing up the lady’s attitude (which was decidedly uncooperative), he pulled over when he reached the town and called the sheriff. the sheriff boarded the bus and issued the lady a warrant, which she immediately tore up and threw out the window. so he made a painful decision, he grabbed her. naturally, she did what anyone would do. she kicked him in the brussels sprouts. that act can get you locked up in saluda, virginia, and that’s precisely what happened to irene morgan on that day. irene morgan? saluda, virginia? wait..we’re not talking about rosa parks? umm, no we are not. history had to wait eleven more years for rosa to do

man arrested for driving drunk on motorized barstool; 'could have killed hundreds', police say ohio man kile wygle went on what police describe as ""a drunken rampage"" tuesday, crashing his personal motorized barstool and nearly killing hundreds of people in the process. the police finally captured wygle early wednesday morning, as he laid on the pavement after attempting a u-turn, but subsequently falling over. he was charged with driving the stool under the influence, as well as attempted genocide. ""it was just an accident,"" said wygle in an interview with cnn's larry king. ""well, not me building and driving the stool. that wasn't an accident. and to be honest, i was kind of trying to fall over at that point, because i thought it would be cool."" the stool, which looks similar to a barstool but with wheels, has been described by police as ""the most dangerous vehicle"" ever invented. it is built of lightweight titanium-dipped tri-weave fibers, which makes the craft lighter and more flexible than most stools. police also say it has spaces on the side that could conceivably accommodate four rocket-propelled grenade launchers and the words ""the death mobile"". wygle used the death mobile to travel around his hometown of newark, ohio, after having consumed close to 15 beers. although nobody was hurt as he reached speeds nearing 20 miles per hour, many did report feeling that their lives were endangered

The article also mentions the rise of market-friendly policies and the impact on leftist leaders.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more similar to this article in style and content, as it discusses the shift towards stability and growth in Latin America, highlighting countries like Chile and Colombia, and mentioning the BRICS bloc's role in promoting alternative economic models. The language used is also more neutral and informative, providing context for the region's changes.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Latin America's New Era of Stability"" presents a biased view, portraying Latin America as moving towards stability and growth under market-friendly policies, while ignoring the complexities and challenges faced by the region. The article also makes sweeping statements about the legacy of Spanish colonialism and British influence on North America, which is not supported by factual evidence.  Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides a more balanced and accurate representation of the current state of politics and economy in Latin America, making it the most similar to the original article.","Latin America's New Era of Stability

For decades, investors in the region have been limited to two options: invest in moderately run countries or those that are truly poorly governed. However, a recent shift has created a new category of ""well-run"" nations, and Chile and Colombia are leading the way.

The legacy of Spanish colonialism and British influence on North America has left Latin America with a tradition of government activism and corruption. The continent's reliance on natural resources has also hindered the development of internationally viable industrial sectors. However, in recent years, countries have begun to adopt more market-friendly policies, leading to increased stability and growth.

One notable example is Venezuela, which has descended into chaos under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro. Despite this, neighboring countries such as Chile and Colombia are thriving, with stable governments and economies.

The region's shift towards stability is also being driven by a growing resistance to Western influence. The BRICS bloc, led by Russia, is playing a key role in promoting alternative economic models and challenging the dominance of the US and its allies.

In Brazil, the election of President Dilma Rousseff has dealt a significant blow to efforts by the CIA and George Soros-funded ""democracy manipulators"" to undermine the country's democratic institutions. The re-election of Rousseff is seen as a major victory for those seeking to promote stability and prosperity in Latin America.

As the region continues to evolve, it is clear that Chile and Colombia are at the forefront of this new era of stability. With their strong economies and stable governments, they offer investors a compelling opportunity to tap into the region's growth potential.","Latin America Sees Shift in Politics and Economy

A wave of protests and new political parties is challenging the orthodoxy of market reforms in the region, as it faces its worst economic crisis in decades. The ranks of these movements are united by their dark skin and low economic station.

In countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, popular protests and new leaders like Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Lucio Gutiérrez are emerging. These leaders often have a background in labor or the military, and are seen as more relatable to the people they represent.

Meanwhile, Cuba is undergoing significant changes after Fidel Castro's death. The country is now led by his brother Raul Castro, who has been praised by some world leaders for his leadership. However, others have criticized him for his authoritarian style.

In other parts of Latin America, countries like Uruguay and Ecuador are veering left, inspired by socialist leaders like Felipe González. This shift is seen as a response to the economic reforms being rejected in the region, which are closely associated with Washington and financial institutions.

The region's economic crisis has also led to increased focus on issues such as trade, energy, and drug trafficking. The Summit of the Americas, attended by President Obama, aims to address these challenges and promote prosperity.

As the region navigates this new landscape, there is a growing consensus against the way the United States is using its power. Populist leaders like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua are emerging, often ruling through force of personality rather than institutions. The region's complex politics and history have created a unique dynamic, where family ties and personal relationships play a significant role in shaping politics.

Overall, Latin America is undergoing a fundamental redefinition of identity, with new leaders and movements emerging to challenge the status quo.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

for decades, investors with an interest in latin america were essentially limited to two choices: invest in countries that were moderately badly run; or invest in countries that were truly dreadfully run. most recently, it’s been the “dreadfully run” group that seems to be attracting new members: bolivia, ecuador and nicaragua have subscribed to the economic and political doctrines of hugo chavez’s venezuela. however, two elections this year have created a new category of latin american country – the “truly well run” class – and installed the first two members: chile and colombia. as investors, we should rejoice, make them part of our portfolio, and keep an eagle eye out for other countries that may join this promising new category – the “good guys.” a foundation of failure latin america’s traditional lousy government was due to a number of factors. the legacy of spanish colonialism lacked the free-market focus that was a british legacy in north america. the continent retained a tradition of government activism and corruption that has proved hugely damaging for latin america. then there was the curse of natural resources: it was always impossible to establish an internationally viable industrial sector when abundant (albeit cyclical) resource income pushed exchange rates up too far. during the 1945 to 1980 period, the world bank pushed policies of import substitution that made no economic sense, and encouraged the countries to run up debt. only in the 1980s – when the international

suspicions cia infects south american leaders with cancer (before it's news) sourced by ozhouse.org english.pravda.ru over 18 months period four progressive leaders of latin america and their fellow citizens were shocked by the diagnosis delivered by their physicians – cancer. fernando lugo, luis inacio lula da silva, hugo chavez, and recently cristina fernandez de kirchner were given this diagnosis. the presidents of paraguay, brazil, venezuela and argentina suspiciously simultaneously turned out on the verge of survival. chavez immediately warned that the disease may be a “new weapon of the empire to eliminate unwanted leaders.” maybe, but oddly enough, the result was the opposite. all politicians not only did not stop their political life and moved away from responsibilities, but on the contrary, dramatically increased their rating and rallied around the supporters. first, in august of 2010 60-year-old paraguayan president fernando lugo was diagnosed with a tumor of lymphatic system. after six sessions of chemotherapy in sao paulo and asuncion, doctors reported that the tumor was gone. he was elected in 2008 with a mandate for five years. he resigned his ecclesiastical rank and became the second leftist president in the history of the country. 66-year-old former brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva was diagnosed with larynx cancer in october of 2011, nine months after

Article 3 - brics builds wall of opposition to the pentagon
‘building a brics wall’: stopping the western juggernaut president putin’s visit to latin america is of transcendental importance at a time when the brics bloc is becoming something far more than a mere trade agreement, and where russia is playing a key global geopolitical role. russian president vladimir putin is in the midst of a truly historic tour of latin america, visiting cuba, nicaragua, argentina, and then on to brazil for the 6th brics summit being held in the cities of fortaleza and brasilia (with a quick sunday stopover in glorious rio de janeiro where he watched the final world-cup match pitting argentina and germany). stopping the western juggernaut ever since the tragedy of 9/11, the us, uk and its nato allies (plus israel) have become a danger to the world. over the past thirteen years we have seen the overrunning of iraq over false american and british accusations that it was harboring weapons of mass destruction that were never found; the destruction of libya in 2011; the wanton engineered chaos of the “arab spring” that set countries like egypt back decades; the near destruction of syria; and the decade-long threats of preventive war against iran over its non-existent military nuclear program. estimates of iraqi dead run into the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and yet there hasn’t been one single apology from the us, uk or

farc leader claims it is not weakened % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), the marxist rebel group that is both the largest and oldest in the country, denied reports that it has been weakened, days after it released 10 hostages who were held for more than a decade. in a video that was posted on youtube in recent days, the group’s leader, ivan marquez, said farc “is not weakened,” as claimed by colombian president juan manuel santos. the video showed what appeared to be a few hundred men clad in military uniforms shouting slogans and raising their weapons in the air in a densely wooded area. farc is considered a terrorist organization by the u.s., the european union, and colombia and has battled with colombia’s army for five decades. the group has been blamed for a number of kidnappings as well as drug trafficking in the country and is said to be holding a large number of hostages, although the exact number is unclear. the group is also believed to have employed or is using child soldiers, torture, and has committed extrajudicial killings, which have affected a number of nearby civilians, according to a united nations report in 2005. farc is also believed to have used antipersonnel mines—a weapon that is mostly internationally banned—and to have used terrorist attacks that have killed a number of civilians

venezuela descends into barbarity and depravity % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! this article was published by the mcalvany intelligence advisor on friday, december 22, 2017: former harvard university professor george santayana said, “those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” what’s frustrating isn’t that those lessons are obscure; it’s that those promoting provable falsehoods from history are allowed such public acceptance and credibility. it reminds one of the cigarette sellers’ slogan: “winston tastes good like a cigarette should.” never mind that smoking will kill you. that’s why this writer holds in such contempt liars like bernie sanders, nancy pelosi, hillary clinton, and, more dangerously, elizabeth warren, who is already gearing up for her run for the presidency in 2020. this article, however, isn’t about them and their intentional promoting of the lie, but the most remarkable test case for the failure of socialism extant: venezuela. one of those most intimately familiar with the lie was nicolas maduro’s attorney general, luisa ortega diaz (ortega for short). she bought the lie, joining venezuela’s public prosecution service in april 2002. in 2007 she was appointed prosecutor general, equivalent to attorney general. in december

are you an american, or a person living in america? (before it's news) american, or living in america? before you read this, you need to ask yourself a question. are you an american or a person living in america? this answer will be important later in the article. i watched the movie war on democracy by john pilger at the recommendation on a facebook acquaintance, russell luck. i was pleasantly surprised with the movie as it raised many questions and allowed for many conclusions to be made even though many appear contrary to the overall message of the film. while john pilger’s documentary focused on the perils of south america, i found it easy to make cross reference to what is happening in the middle east. don’t think i dismiss the atrocities of history that has occurred in south america, because i do not, however it is a few links in a large chain as i see it. no matter where you look today there are a few patterns of history that seem to be repeating and this film outlines many of them very well. the intent to achieve global governance , complete control of the world, through political means. the control of the masses, as well as the natural instinct to breed the society for domination and slavery positions alike. this is often achieved through the takeover of land and religion. the collapse of the monetary system allowing for a merge of the “classes”. the presence of biblical prophecy presenting itself as the last days. the first thing you need to understand to grasp the

soros and cia suffer huge defeat in brazil (before it's news) tnd guest contributor: wayne madsen | the central intelligence agency and its george soros-funded “democracy manipulators” in brazil suffered a major defeat with the re-election as president of brazil of workers’ party standard bearer and ex-marxist guerrilla dilma rouseff. in the hours prior to rousseff’s handy re-election, the corporate western media was still reporting that the election was “too close to call” even as exit polling indicated that rousseff would trounce her cia- and soros-backed conservative opponent aecio neves by at least 2 percentage points. the new york times, globe and mail, reuters, and other corporate media outlets were obviously disappointed by rousseff’s victory, with many of these pro-wall street contrivances that masquerade as journalistic enterprises referring to neves as a “centrist” who “narrowly” lost to rousseff. the associated press wistfully wrote, “there are not enough outstanding votes left to be counted to allow her [rousseff] rival [neves] to catch up with her”. and alberto ramos, goldman sachs’s chief economist for latin america, warned that rousseff should abandon her policies that help brazil’s poor or “market confidence” in brazil will continue to suffer. bloomberg news predicted the value of brazil’s

Article 1 - native latins are astir and thirsty for power
whether filled with indians in the andes, blacks and mixed-race ''caboclos'' and ''mulatos'' in brazil or the poor of argentina's outlying provinces, the ranks of these new political movements are united by the dark color of their skin and their low economic station. with popular protests and new political parties, they are challenging the orthodoxy of market reforms as the region faces its worst economic crisis in decades. in the process, latin america's political landscape is being redrawn. parties that have been the pillars of governments from caracas to quito to buenos aires are collapsing or fast losing influence. ''latin america is undergoing a fundamental redefinition of identity,'' said elisa carrio, the leading antiestablishment candidate in the presidential election scheduled in argentina in april. ''that identity is being tinkered with in different ways in each country,'' she said, ''because we are all different and not a single package, but there is one thing in common: we are finally electing leaders who look like the people they represent.'' in bolivia and peru, this change has been accompanied by violent protests. elsewhere, it has meant the rise of new leaders like president luiz inácio lula da silva in brazil, a former labor leader born a peasant, and lucio gutiérrez in ecuador, a former army colonel who led the coup that overthrew president jamil mahuad, a harvard-educated favorite

fidel castro's death prompts both praise and rebuke across the world: 'i’m crying. tears of joy!' fidel castro's death prompts both praise and rebuke fidel castro died on friday at age 90 — and world leaders were quick to both laud and rebuke the leader. (charles platiau/reuters) 4:07 am reactions to the death of fidel castro were as varied as opinions about the revolutionary leader in life. the longtime cuban comandante died at 10:29 p.m. on friday , his brother and current cuban president raul castro announced with a shaky voice shortly after midnight. he was 90. “with profound pain, i have to sadly inform you,” castro said in spanish, “that today, the commander and leader of the cuban revolution, fidel castro ruz, died.” as word got out that castro would be cremated in havana on saturday morning, world leaders took to social media to praise — and rebuke — the cigar-smoking ruler, who led the island nation with an iron fist from 1959 until 2008. venezuealan president nicolas maduro (far left) was among the first world leaders to praise castro (far right).

Article 3 - john mccain’s feb. 19 speech
we live in a world of change, some of which holds great promise for us and all mankind and some of which poses great peril. today, political change in pakistan is occurring that might affect our relationship with a nuclear armed nation that is indispensable to our success in combating al qaeda in afghanistan and elsewhere. an old enemy of american interests and ideals is leaving the world stage, and we can glimpse the hope that freedom might someday come to the people of cuba. a self-important bully in venezuela threatens to cut off oil shipments to our country at a time of sky-rocketing gas prices. each event poses a challenge and an opportunity. will the next president have the experience, the judgment experience informs, and the strength of purpose to respond to each of these developments in ways that strengthen our security and advance the global progress of our ideals? or will we risk the confused leadership of an inexperienced candidate who once suggested invading our ally, pakistan, and sitting down without pre-conditions or clear purpose with enemies who support terrorists and are intent on destabilizing the world by acquiring nuclear weapons? the most important obligation of the next president is to protect americans from the threat posed by violent extremists who despise us, our values and modernity itself. they are moral monsters, but they are also a disciplined, dedicated movement driven by an apocalyptic zeal, which celebrates murder, has access to science, technology and mass communications, and is determined to acquire and use against us weapons of mass destruction.

Article 4 - online in ecuador? it's taking awhile
the discrepancies make experts pessimistic. they worry that the rapid pace of change in the technology industry will cause third-world nations like ecuador to slip further behind europe and north america. ''in the late 1990's, everyone jumped up in arms over the digital divide, but it has proven almost impossible to bridge,'' said peter hakim, president of the inter-american dialogue, a washington-based policy-analysis center, and an expert on latin america. ''it is a region of inequality. why would access to technology be any different than access to education, health care, employment or financial aid?'' in 2000, fewer than 1 percent of ecuadoreans had sent e-mail or surfed the web at home, school or work or in cybercafes. in august 2001, in an effort to expand access, the government created the national connectivity commission. public ''telecentros'' have sprung up to provide free internet access -- under the auspices of nonprofit groups for which the commission helps find donors -- and home connections, previously timed by the minute, are now available for a flat rate of about $25 a month.

Article 6 - hugo chavez says cancer made him 'more christian;' has faith christ will bring 'miracle'
a cancer-stricken hugo chavez is becoming ""more christian"" as he battles a reoccurring form of the disease that could significantly stifle his chances for re-election in october. little is known about the condition of the 57-year-old leader, or even the type of cancer he has, but his repeated trips for cancer treatment and operations in socialist cuba have left many in venezuela questioning the political future of their country, despite chavez's new found faith that has led him to claim that he indeed will be healed. ""i'm sure our christ will do it again, continuing making the miracle,"" chavez told supporters in caracas last tuesday before heading to cuba for what the leader said would be the ""home stretch"" of his caner treatment, according to the associated press. chavez is known for his strong leftist beliefs in which secularism plays a significant role. he has been much less visible than in previous years in the venezuelan media, but ultimately shows no sign of wanting to bow out from his political career despite his potentially fatal illness. instead, the leader is finding solace in jesus christ -- something he now shares with his country almost every time he appears on television. ""give me your crown, jesus. give me your cross, your thorns so i may bleed. but give me life, because i have more to do for this country and these people,"" the leader said in april during an emotional pre-easter mass.

Article 7 - trade, energy and drugs are topics for obama at summit of the americas
washington — president obama on friday heads to latin america for the third time for a summit meeting whose very location — colombia — reflects the broader economic and security gains in the hemisphere. mr. obama will spend the weekend in colombia’s coastal city of cartagena at the summit of the americas for discussions with other leaders on trade, energy and that constant, drug trafficking. in contrast with the previous gathering three years ago, when the global economic crisis forced the leaders to focus simply on weathering the downturn, the changed agenda and mood for this gathering is summed up by its name — “connecting the americas: partners for prosperity.” the president will be navigating several controversial areas. some leaders want to legalize currently illicit drugs; the united states is routinely pressed to end its half-century-old embargo against cuba; and american unions continue to criticize colombia’s labor-rights record. but none of those issues is seen as likely to overshadow the meeting. “the best of the summit, what it provides, is an opportunity for the heads of state from all the countries in the hemisphere, almost all of them, to come together and have a moment — a forced moment — to talk,” said shannon k. o’neil, a latin american studies fellow at the council on foreign relations. and on energy, commerce and infrastructure projects, she added, “you could see movement forward” that will not necessarily be reflected in the press releases. advertisement continue reading the main story for the

Article 8 - with new chief, uruguay veers left, in a latin pattern
from one country and leader to the next, the governments can be described as representing similar ""tendencies within a spectrum that allows for various colorations,"" in the words of gilberto dupas, director of the institute of advanced studies at the university of são paulo. indeed, though many of the new leaders have roots on the revolutionary left, they now seem inspired less by che guevara than felipe gonzález, the socialist who was formerly spain's prime minister. they have shown they are willing to play by the established rules of the game, even if it forces them to abandon cherished ideological goals. that overriding pragmatism has left the bush administration less overtly antagonistic to the trend than it might have been in another era, with the clear exception of president hugo chávez in venezuela, who is more fiery and provocatively populist than most. still, across the board, the attitude toward the united states has been one characterized by at least polite distancing, the case here and in neighboring brazil and argentina, as the economic reforms being rejected are closely associated with washington and the financial institutions it backs, the world bank and the international monetary fund. ""there is a growing consensus against the way the united states is using its power,"" said marta lagos, director of latinobarómetro, a chilean public opinion firm that regularly conducts surveys of political attitudes around the continent. ""ten years ago that was an attitude typical of the elite,

Article 9 - cbc upset over pelosi’s proposed changes – this week: house democratic leadership elections – the hill’s new power playe
by heather caygle ( hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope ) with an assist from daniel lippman story continued below cbc upset over proposed changes— house minority leader nancy pelosi faces her first real leadership challenge in years when caucus members—many still fuming over democrats’ poor showing on election day—vote wednesday on their leaders for the next congress. pelosi is expected to fend off challenger tim ryan but not before angering several members who complain she’s done little to address their concerns about the stagnation in leadership and her iron grip control of the caucus. “this will be the last go around for the current leadership slate, no matter what happens,” a senior democratic aide predicted to huddle over the weekend. the latest example: rep. cedric richmond circulated a memo to the congressional black caucus just before thanksgiving criticizing lower-level leadership changes pelosi is pushing, saying she is promoting some ideas that would significantly diminish the power of the cbc while ignoring member suggestions that could make a real impact. for example, pelosi proposed making the assistant leader role, currently held by rep. james clyburn, a position filled by a member who has served fewer than three terms whenever clyburn leaves the post. “[t]he original memo proposed that the assistant leader position be filled by someone who has served fewer than five terms. why was this reduced to three terms?” richmond wrote. “we have a

Article 10 - the marxist turned caudillo: a family story
mr. ortega is, after all, a crusader for good government who has allied himself with the country’s most corrupt figures; an advocate of the poor who has become very rich through a series of mysterious business deals; and a leftist ideologue who has proven ready to embrace any cause — most recently a total ban on abortion — that will bring him political advantage. nicaragua is a small country of 5.6 million people. every member of the political class knows every other member, and in many cases they have complex personal and familial ties. to outsiders, the country seems bitterly divided by politics. political disputes, however, often mask feuds within families and clans. outsiders may interpret mr. ortega’s abandonment of nearly everything he once seemed to believe as an act of spectacular cynicism. to nicaraguans, it is just the latest example of how leaders of their quarrelsome nation are, in the end, prone to forgive each other and find new ways to share the spoils. that is not the only aspect of nicaraguan political life that has remained constant despite the huge changes that have reshaped the country over the last quarter-century. nicaraguans, like people in some other latin american lands, are still ready to support populist leaders who rule through the force of personality rather than through institutions. they remain suspicious of the united states, which has repeatedly intervened in nicaragua over the last century. and they are as fascinated as ever with family

Title: latin america's new politics aren't left or right
Content: latin america latin america's new politics aren't left or right mac margolis writes about latin america for bloomberg view. he was a reporter for newsweek and is the author of “the last new world: the conquest of the amazon frontier.” mac margolis donald trump was not the only churlish septuagenarian with some eccentric notions about world affairs to score big in the americas this month. on nov. 6, nicaraguan guerrilla-turned-strongman daniel ortega won his third consecutive presidential mandate . to hear ortega's boosters tell it, his re-election was a much needed affirmation for the latin american leftist leaders who are now faltering or being pushed from power by a revanchist right-wing uprising. yet something more complicated is going on than the familiar trope of left-right politics. true, the cold war era's reductive binary vocabulary still echoes. during the mid-1990s and early 2000s, as political challengers across the americas pushed back against the free-market, pro-globalization gospel of the washington consensus, the so-called pink tide hit its high-water mark in venezuela, with hugo chavez's bolivarian revolution. now, we are to believe, that tide is going out, with conservatives taking office in brazil, argentina , colombia and peru , some with a soft spot for old fashioned authoritarianism . yet facile left-right labeling calls for scrutiny. start with nicaragua, where after returning to power in 2006, the former marxist insurgent ortega dropped the comrade act to court investors, encourage trade, contain inflation and slash debt, even as he reduced poverty. those market-friendly policies won him commendations from the world bank and the international monetary fund -- no matter that the spoils went largely to handpicked businesses , including several run by ortega's family . to consolidate his rule, the ageing autocrat went on to capture the country's courts, rig the electoral system, smother dissent, and call it a victory of popular democracy. ortega's shamelessly lopsided 72 percent winning margin earned him comparisons to anastasio somoza , the bloody military dictator his sandinista insurgents chased out of power 37 years ago. nicaragua is no military dictatorship, but neither is ortega a revolutionary progressive any more than donald trump is a reagan conservative. that's an extreme version of a familiar tale: a popular leader rises, promising social redemption and to tame neoliberal capitalism, only to become the new political establishment, and a leftist in name only. other heralds of the pink tide haven't been so fortunate. the commodities boom helped maintain appearances, giving leftist leaders from brazil, argentina, and venezuela the cash to fuel social programs and cherry pick companies to promote in the private sector. but the end of the boom gutted economic growth and public accounts, cutting deeply into headline social programs -- and, soon

Latin America's New Era of Stability

For decades, investors in the region have been limited to two options: invest in moderately run countries or those that are truly poorly governed. However, a recent shift has created a new category of ""well-run"" nations, and Chile and Colombia are leading the way.

The legacy of Spanish colonialism and British influence on North America has left Latin America with a tradition of government activism and corruption. The continent's reliance on natural resources has also hindered the development of internationally viable industrial sectors. However, in recent years, countries have begun to adopt more market-friendly policies, leading to increased stability and growth.

One notable example is Venezuela, which has descended into chaos under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro. Despite this, neighboring countries such as Chile and Colombia are thriving, with stable governments and economies.

The region's shift towards stability is also being driven by a growing resistance to Western influence. The BRICS bloc, led by Russia, is playing a key role in promoting alternative economic models and challenging the dominance of the US and its allies.

In Brazil, the election of President Dilma Rousseff has dealt a significant blow to efforts by the CIA and George Soros-funded ""democracy manipulators"" to undermine the country's democratic institutions. The re-election of Rousseff is seen as a major victory for those seeking to promote stability and prosperity in Latin America.

As the region continues to evolve, it is clear that Chile and Colombia are at the forefront of this new era of

Latin America Sees Shift in Politics and Economy

A wave of protests and new political parties is challenging the orthodoxy of market reforms in the region, as it faces its worst economic crisis in decades. The ranks of these movements are united by their dark skin and low economic station.

In countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, popular protests and new leaders like Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Lucio Gutiérrez are emerging. These leaders often have a background in labor or the military, and are seen as more relatable to the people they represent.

Meanwhile, Cuba is undergoing significant changes after Fidel Castro's death. The country is now led by his brother Raul Castro, who has been praised by some world leaders for his leadership. However, others have criticized him for his authoritarian style.

In other parts of Latin America, countries like Uruguay and Ecuador are veering left, inspired by socialist leaders like Felipe González. This shift is seen as a response to the economic reforms being rejected in the region, which are closely associated with Washington and financial institutions.

The region's economic crisis has also led to increased focus on issues such as trade, energy, and drug trafficking. The Summit of the Americas, attended by President Obama, aims to address these challenges and promote prosperity.

As the region navigates this new landscape, there is a growing consensus against the way the United States is using its power. Populist leaders like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua are emerging, often

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, a different kind of storm was brewing. Anti-Chinese protesters clashed with mainland shoppers, leaving a trail of hurt feelings and confusion. But on Weibo, users rallied around the hashtag #WeAreAllChinese, sparking a poignant conversation about identity and unity.

In Australia's east coast, three friends embarked on an epic adventure, exploring the world's oldest rainforest, Sydney's iconic Opera House, and the Great Barrier Reef. Their 10-day itinerary was a masterclass in balancing city adventures with outdoor escapades.

But for some travelers, the journey wasn't always smooth. At Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta Airport, a growing number of visitors were choosing to spend the night, drawn by the airport's convenience and affordability.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, Asia is emerging as a hotbed of innovation. Theme park queuing specialist LO-Q is setting its sights on the region, where demand for its services is skyrocketing.

For those seeking refuge from the storm, some countries are offering a safe haven. Costa Rica, with its stable social fabric and economic freedom, has become an attractive destination for expats.

In Hue, Vietnam, a charming bakery on Pham Nguu Lau Street has become a hotspot for foodies and hipsters alike. La Carambole's French-Vietnamese cuisine is a must-try, while Tiong Bahru in Singapore offers a unique blend of art deco charm and trendy cafes.

As the world becomes more complex, it's essential to explore the unconventional – to discover hidden gems like these and forge new connections with fellow travelers.","New York City's culinary scene is on the rise, with a plethora of options to suit every taste and budget. For those seeking an authentic Chinese experience, Great Wall Restaurant in New Haven offers a vast menu featuring Sichuan and Cantonese specialties, including dim sum on weekends.

In contrast, some businesses are bracing for a potential slowdown due to the convergence of Christmas and Hanukkah celebrations. The Wright Music Shop in Port Washington expects an increase in sales as family members use their holiday gifts to purchase musical instruments.

Meanwhile, fashion enthusiasts can indulge in a variety of dining options during Fashion Week. The Ace Hotel's lobby features branches of Opening Ceremony and Stumptown Coffee Roasters, while Sweet 50 has refined its menu to cater to the city's finicky tastes.

In Brooklyn, the Lodge General Store offers a rustic setting with sophisticated food options, including imported burrata and organic products. However, some restaurants are adapting to changing times by revamping menus, lowering prices, and offering special deals.

For those seeking a more laid-back experience, bowling alleys like Whitestone Lanes in Queens offer a simple and spacious atmosphere, free from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The Salvation Army's former building on Bowery has been lost as a symbol of hope for the homeless, but its legacy lives on through community centers that continue to serve those in need.

As New York City continues to evolve, it's clear that there's something for everyone – from high-end dining to casual bowling and everything in between.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - kl 2012 – courtyard boutique hotel
kl 2012 – courtyard boutique hotel headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! kuala lumpur has its share of hotels, but boutique hotels are a lot harder to come by. when i heard that there was a new boutique hotel in the bukit bintang area and the pricing was very reasonable, i told myself that i had to check it out. booking on agoda was again quite hassle free and the pricing at rm 164++ per night was very reasonable. the pictures certainly look pretty good. the hotel is located along jalan tengkat tong shin, just one street down from the famous jalan alor. the hotel is so new that none of the taxi drivers i talked to knew about it. we couldn’t find it on the street so i decided to just get off the taxi and find it myself. it turned out that the hotel is located in one of the side lanes and not so visible from the main street. the location is certainly very convenient, but still a bit on the rough and tumble side. there is no doubt that it will be gentrified real soon with all the developments going around, but for the moment i would say that it’s not so suitable for ladies traveling alone. when i arrived the hotel looked exactly like the photos. it is a small and charming single storey colonial-style building with a courtyard in the middle – hence the name. check-in was pretty smooth though there was only one person on duty.

(before it's news) kuching used to have quite a number of good chinese restaurants – chia heng restaurant, chui hua lau, golden dragon – these were familiar names and now they are no more. perhaps it is due to the changing palate of kuchingites. there are only a handful of good chinese restaurants left in kuching – and joyous shanghai is one of the best. by kl or singapore standards, the decor at joyous shanghai would be considered basic – but in kuching this is considered one of the more opulent chinese restaurants. the dining area is not very big – accommodating up to 10 tables. there are a few private rooms should you want a bit more privacy. the menu here focus on shanghainese cuisine. you can order many of the popular shanghainese appetizers here. we opted for the special appetizer platter that comes in a wooden boat. there are 3 items – fish cake, maki rolls and crispy prawns. not really shanghainese – but all good. they do their soup here really well – but it can get pricey. this is the soup with dried seafood which is really delicious. the deep fried pork ribs is one of our favourites – crispy outside and the meat is a bit chewy – but

singapore 2015 – tiong bahru (before it's news) singapore used to be just singapore – but nowadays you can’t talk about singapore without talking about its neighbourhoods. this is partly due to the emergence of hipster culture – young urban trend-setters who are constantly on the look out for the next in thing. these hipsters who speak with their wallets are the main contributors to the rise and fall of a particular neighbourhood. in the past 5 years or so several distinct neighbourhoods have become very popular – little india, kampung glam, keong saik road, tiong bahru, and one of the latest up-and-coming hipster hangout – everton park. it was a nice clear day and i decided to visit tiong bahru which i haven’t been for decades. i was mainly drawn there by the famous tiong bahru bakery – but also curious to revisit this neighbourhood and find out why it was so attractive to the local hipsters. tiong bahru is an urban housing neighbourhood built in the 1930s. here you find some of the rare examples of art deco design in singapore. in the old days the buildings might have looked utilitarian – but today the small art deco touches give the neighbourhood its laid-back charm. after wondering around for a bit i finally found books actually – one of the first ventures which kick-started this area as a hipster hangout. it is a very charming bookshop packed to

Article 1 - dim sum, and much more, in a no-frills setting
photo a friend of mine advised caution when i told him i was visiting great wall restaurant in new haven, noting the tripe and chicken feet on the menu. in fact, both are delicious, but the restaurant also offers pages of less adventuresome options. great wall specializes in sichuan and cantonese cuisines, including an extensive selection of dim sum on weekends. the restaurant’s functional, institutional atmosphere is cafeterialike, evoking manhattan’s chinatown. the owners, michelle and peter guo, ran a smaller version of the restaurant in the back of their hong kong grocery on whitney avenue. in 2007, the guos bought the building next door, moved the grocery there, sold it and expanded the restaurant to fill the original space. one could eat here for weeks and not taste everything on the menu, which is vast even by chinese-restaurant standards. those in a hurry can choose dishes from the steam table up front to eat in or take out. otherwise, customers are ushered to booths where young servers slap down menus and pitchers of hot tea, and take orders at top speed. photo at my first dinner, i tasted standards like won ton and hot and sour soups, and shrimp fried rice; all were acceptable renditions, but i would not travel for them. a friend who was born in hong kong had recommended a broth, fish and bean curd “casserole” that was far more interesting: there were

Article 2 - businesses ponder pluses and minuses as christmas and hanukkah converge
in the week between christmas and new year's day, business at the wright music shop in port washington typically runs backward: a lot of returns, and very few new sales. but the quirks of the holiday calendar this year have jonathan w. watkins, the owner of the store, looking forward to the week. ''i expect to be busier than last year, because a lot of family members get money as their hanukkah gift,'' mr. watkins said. ''some of them will use that money to buy a guitar, a saxophone.'' businesses all over the island have been sizing up what it will mean for them that the eight-day jewish festival of hanukkah, which usually falls earlier in the month, is starting on the evening of christmas day this year. some see potential headaches in the confluence of holidays, which last happened in 1959. others see it breathing life into the usual late-december lull, as consumers and businesses alike stretch their holiday shopping and entertaining past dec. 25. ''normally it gets quiet after christmas, and we get ready for new year's eve,'' said john a. kowalenko, who owns the art of eating catering in amagansett. ''but there are a number of events happening between christmas and new year's, including some office parties that we are catering. i think a lot of people are resolved to the fact that it is going to be a very social time, and not

Article 3 - square feet/soho; a manhattan outpost for passionate cooks
laura h. pomerantz, a principal at pbs realty advisors, which is the leasing agent for 75 spring street, said the area is also strong because of a museum of modern art design store and a large starbucks nearby. ""this is a very powerful corner,"" she said. ""there is as much traffic on that corner, at spring and crosby street, as there is on broadway."" at george smith, peter howlett, the retailer's director of operations, said his store was in negotiations for about 6,000 square feet of retail showroom space farther west on spring street, between hudson and varick streets, with plans to open the new store in september. until then, he said, george smith will consolidate its retail operations in 3,000 square feet at 73 spring street, space that has been part of its store but is in a different building. also this summer, the company plans to open its first to-the-trade showroom, in 3,000 square feet on 59th street, between second and third avenues. the decision to move was a financial one, mr. howlett said. ""when we came to spring street from london in 1990, we were pioneers in the area, but now retail rents in the area have gone up to a level that we weren't comfortable paying,"" he said. mr. howlett added that as a ""destination"" store, george smith typically relies less on

Article 7 - waiter, hold the foie gras: slump hits new york dining
it's a sea change in a food-obsessed city. diners who were willing to endure a three-month wait for a reservation just months ago are now being courted with free meals, discounts and solicitous service. for almost a year, sales in restaurants across the country have been steadily declining. but new york, the country's premier restaurant city, seemed to buck the trend. no more. most restaurateurs are not panicking, and dining rooms appear to be bustling all over town. but a growing number of owners -- particularly of restaurants below the top tier -- are concerned enough to change the way they do business. they are revamping menus, lowering prices, offering special prix fixe meals, even instituting frequent-diner programs. harder times for restaurants have meant, in many cases, better times for the clientele. ''at the very best restaurants it's easier to get in,'' said tim zagat, who owns the zagat restaurant guide with his wife, nina. ''they are politer at places like nobu. last year they didn't even pick up the phone. those restaurants are a lot more accessible, but once you get there they are still full.'' signs of a slowdown are everywhere. william troy, the owner of cascade linen in brooklyn, keeps a dow jones of napkin rentals that includes 18 of the restaurants his company services. his napkin index has seen a drop of 5.6 percent since the beginning of the year

Article 9 - back-to-basics bowling (no fancy-pants stuff)
for all these reasons and more, i found myself on a quest for the bowling alleys of my youth, pilgrimages by subway to prove that the endangered american sport is holding on thanks to die-hards, immigrants and simply fans of casual bowling far from the hunks and pumps of manhattan. queens the whitestone lanes in queens is perhaps the most tucked-away bowling alley in new york. take the no. 7 train to the end of the line, then walk about 20 minutes past the neon signs and chinese restaurants of flushing. it’s like traveling through hong kong to get to ohio. after a quick stop for delicious taiwanese food we kept walking as the neon gave way to quiet residential streets leading to the back of a strip mall along the whitestone expressway. there my friends and i found the holy grail of bowling: 48 lanes mercifully free of music and muscle. league bowlers showed off their hooks a few feet from a snack bar with glorious fried foods. the smell of the grease, the dull roar of the crowd surrounded us. on a monday night half the lanes were filled with league players, the others sporadically occupied by an array of bowlers representing the diversity of new york: hispanic families, teenagers and a group of middle-aged men who prayed before starting their game. open 24 hours a day, whitestone lanes is a bowling alley as it should be: simple and spacious, and ms. pac-man was the

the next day, the moving trucks arrived to haul away the gray folding tables and the red chairs the members had dined on and traded advice over; the pulpit where major ki had preached on sundays; the projector that had scrolled chinese opera lyrics during karaoke; the computers they had used to learn to send email. for about as long as the bowery has been known as a place for the down and out, the building at 223-225 bowery, still one of the tallest on the mile-long thoroughfare, has stood as a symbol of the salvation army’s brand of hope among the misery of skid row. at its height, between the civil war and the great depression, the group offered more than 140 services citywide, including at least five shelters and a clinic on the bowery, as the number of homeless people in the city surpassed 20,000 men, women and children for the first time. but the demographics of the bowery have changed since the salvation army moved into what was known as booth house ii 101 years ago. homelessness declined during world war ii, as economic conditions improved and veterans’ assistance expanded. the number of flophouses, gin mills and charities that catered to the area dwindled to dozens. many resident alcoholics, prostitutes and vagrants migrated elsewhere, spurred in part by city efforts to scatter them. photo the community center’s belongings were following that same path. they were bound for bensonhurst, brooklyn

Title: in chinatown, a taste of revival
Content: most restaurants have cut back in various ways. dim sum go go in chatham square has let go half its employees, and some days sweet-n-tart cafe closes at 11 p.m. instead of midnight. others are offering discounts, like the 10 percent reduction given weekdays at new wonton garden on mott street. a group of restaurateurs has banded with local and city organizations to run flashy campaigns in windows, newspapers and tourist literature to lure patrons back around the lazy susans. ms. fields is organizing a ''manhattan night out'' tomorrow to bring 300 to 400 business and civic leaders into chinatown ''to visit the shops and eat in the restaurants to boost the businesses that are still not coming back as quickly as the owners need.'' they in turn, she hopes, will spread the word that chinatown is open. unlike little italy, which it abuts and partially surrounds, chinatown has evolved over the last 20 years, particularly as new immigrants from hong kong have invested in the neighborhood. a better name for the area, in fact, would be asia city now that so many malaysian, thai and vietnamese restaurants have opened in the congested blocks north and south of canal street. many are lavishly designed, and they have been joined by sleek tea salons catering to a hip young crowd with pearl tea jazzed up with tapioca, and by very modern bakeries that would be at home on upper madison avenue if not for the steamed pork buns sold along with the french-inspired pastries. chinatown is now being promoted with little italy and harlem in a get-out-the- diners campaign by nyc & company, the city's convention and visitors bureau. business in those other neighborhoods is also off by 45 to 50 percent, according to the bureau, but chinatown is easily the most competitive restaurant environment. that handy gazetteer the zagat survey lists 36 restaurants in the area bounded by hester street on the north, lafayette street on the west and allen and pike streets on the east. but on sunday i counted 26 restaurants open and one closed just on the four blocks of mott street between canal and chatham square. and that did not include all the bakeries and tea salons on that stretch, or the hong kong cake stall with the long line at mosco street. even before sept. 11, the ground had started shifting under chinatown. already more and more immigrants -- and restaurateurs -- were settling in sunset park in brooklyn or in elmhurst and flushing in queens, where rents are lower. the closing of the grand street subway stop last summer had slowed pedestrian traffic. and increasingly there was competition closer in, from trendy asian spots in nolita like funky broome and clay. after sept. 11, things got radically worse with restrictions on traffic and telephone service for weeks. the smell from the wreckage

In Brooklyn, the Lodge General Store offers a rustic setting with sophisticated food options, including imported burrata and organic products. However, some restaurants are adapting to changing times by revamping menus, lowering prices, and offering special deals.

For those seeking a more laid-back experience, bowling alleys like Whitestone Lanes in Queens offer a simple and spacious atmosphere, free from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan. The Salvation Army's former building on Bowery has been lost as a symbol of hope for the homeless, but its legacy lives on through community centers that continue to serve those in need.

As New York City continues to evolve, it's clear that there's something for everyone – from high-end dining to casual

sometimes, life throws you an unfair curveball. it could be something as simple and mundane as a flat tire on your way to work or it could be something as significant as the ncaa standing in the way of you doing your job. such was the case for general assignment reporter eric alvarez of fox nashville. alvarez was attempting to report on the elite eight round of march madness for his local fox affiliate, but hit a show-stopping snag when the ncaa wouldn’t allow the show to use its highlight film. in a situation like this, alvarez was faced with two options: shrug his shoulders and give up…or improvise. he went with the latter. rather than pull actual game film, alvarez used legos to bring to life the action packed events of the gonzaga vs. xavier and oregon vs. kansas games. needless to say, it’s beautiful. do yourselves a favor and treat yourself to the ingenuity by watching the quick video below courtesy of alvarez himself. this is what happens when we can't show ncaa hoops highlights and @pjfox17 and @davefoster17 leave me unsupervised on @foxnashville sports. pic.twitter.com/kue479xvsu — eric alvarez (@fox17eric) march 26, 2017 if you couldn’t tell, i find this to be incredibly impressive. i work in media and i can

''i've talked to everybody,'' he said. ''i'll be guided by advice i'm getting from washington.'' although selig has yet to decide when to resume the season -- tomorrow, during the weekend or next monday -- he indicated he was leaning toward extending the season to make up for the lost games.

The game was marked by questionable play-calling and penalties that gave Utah fourth down, but despite the odds, fans remained optimistic about their team's chances of tying up the game. The energy at Rice-Eccles Stadium was palpable, with both teams' supporters filling the stands with creative signs and costumes.

Meanwhile, in other news, the Big Ten Conference has announced plans to play some games on Friday nights next season, sparking controversy among high school football coaches who feel that this will disrupt their schedules. The Ohio High School Football Coaches Association has joined forces with prep coaches from Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin to express their concerns.

In a more lighthearted note, the Maryland Terrapins are gearing up for a crucial matchup against No. 2 Michigan, with defensive end Roman Braglio hoping to put Saturday's stunning loss to Indiana behind him. The Ravens, meanwhile, are struggling to find their footing at 0-3, with Joe Flacco on an 0-4 streak against the Bengals.

Overall, while both articles mention similar topics, the reliable news article is more accurate and provides more context, making it clear that this article is not a reliable source of information.","Fukushima Nuclear Disaster: Leaks and Contamination Persist

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which suffered a devastating meltdown in 2011, continues to face significant challenges in containing radioactive leaks. A recent incident at the facility's Multiple Nuclide Removing System (MNS) revealed corrosion issues that led to a leak of radioactive materials just two months after its test operation began.

In another development, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator, reported a significant overflow of radioactive water from a container during a maintenance operation. The incident highlighted concerns about the facility's ability to contain and manage radioactive waste.

Furthermore, recent measurements have revealed high levels of tritium in the ocean surrounding the plant. Tritium, a radioactive isotope, has been detected at concentrations 200 times higher than normal levels in Biscayne Bay, near the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant in Florida.

Experts warn that contaminated water poses significant risks to workers and the environment. The use of frozen walls to contain radioactive materials has been proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Investigations into leaks at other nuclear facilities have also raised concerns about the broader implications for public health and safety. As the Fukushima disaster continues to unfold, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the complex challenges posed by radioactive contamination.","Japan's Nuclear Plant Leaks Raise Concerns Over Contaminated Water Storage

A recent investigation has revealed that a Japanese nuclear plant is storing over 400 tons of contaminated water daily, posing significant risks to the environment and human health. The plant's cooling system, damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, has been rigged together with makeshift solutions, leading to leaks and concerns over the stability of the underground storage pools.

Experts have criticized the plant's owner, Tepco, for using inadequate materials to line the pits, including only two layers of plastic and a clay-based layer just 6.5 millimeters thick. This has raised fears that the water could leak at the seams, contaminating the surrounding area.

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, voters have rejected a proposal to quickly exit the country's nuclear power plants, citing concerns over energy independence. The decision reflects a growing public awareness of the risks associated with nuclear energy and the need for more sustainable alternatives.

In the United States, scientists are working on developing new methods to produce radioisotopes without relying on leaky reactors. One innovative solution involves using a ""target"" made of molybdenum to capture neutrons, which can then be sent to a chemical processing plant for recovery.

However, concerns over radiation safety remain a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in areas with high levels of nuclear activity. A recent study highlighted the need for more comprehensive research into the environmental causes of breast cancer, including exposure to nuclear radiation.

As the world grapples with the challenges of nuclear energy, experts are also exploring new approaches to managing radioactive waste. In Finland, the construction of a new nuclear power plant has sparked economic growth in a remote city, where migrant laborers from over 30 countries have lifted business and brought in significant tax revenue.

Despite these successes, concerns over radiation safety remain a pressing issue, particularly in areas with high levels of nuclear activity. As the world continues to navigate the complexities of nuclear energy, it is clear that more research and investment are needed to ensure public safety and mitigate the risks associated with this technology.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 5 - time for japan to take control of the fukushima disaster
time for japan to take control of the fukushima disaster headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! for more than two years we have watched how the fukushima nuclear plant operator tepco has failed to take control of the disaster or be transparent about the real situation at the stricken plant, trying to hide problems such as leaking contaminated water. tepco’s mismanagement and ignorance of the facts played a key role both in causing the accident – the second worst nuclear accident in history – and increasing the severity of the disaster, according to the official japanese government report. but the japanese government decided to keep tepco afloat with a bail-out of epic proportions, handing the management of the disaster back to those who caused it. the japanese government did this against all commonsense, giving it an easy scapegoat to blame when things turned worse. only a couple of months ago a “rat-like animal” managed to knock out the fukushima plant’s cooling systems, causing the temperature to rise rapidly in the plant. and in the last few weeks the world has watched how the situation at fukushima worsened again, this time with leaks of contaminated water. ending its cover-up, tepco has finally admitted that groundwater was continuing to leak into the pacific ocean, leading the japanese regulator to classify the situation as an emergency and the government finally deciding to step in and take charge. it should not have come as a surprise though. similar to how the experts had

follow-up: nukes to stop the oil gusher? (before it's news) the oil spill in the gulf of mexico continues to spill black venom into the sea. the world has got to see stirring images of oil gushing with decipherable great force, enough even to turn a staunch critic towards environmental protection. initially scoffed and sniffed at, a radical solution in the form of a nuclear explosion is now trotting as a viable option to stop the oil spill. why? because no effort should be spared and so far, the stratagems used by bp have been futile. might as well check out some of the efforts to contain the spill so far: chemical dispersants to the tune of 325,000 gallons have been used with planes spilling those 192 or more times in attempts to degrade the oil droplets. last week, the us coast guard and the environmental protection agency had authorised bp to use subsea dispersants to reduce the damage caused by the spill. these subsea dispersants are expected to break the oil into small droplets preventing them from reaching shore or surface. billed an ‘important step’ in reducing the overall impact, according to initial reports these underwater dispersants are said to be ‘working’. but concerns have been raised about the possible and ‘not- known- yet’ damage to the environment as the toxic dispersant are (corexit 9500 and corexit ec9527a) untested. in ‘junk shot’ method

Article 8 - [column] why is contaminated water issue important ?
[column] why is contaminated water issue important ? (before it's news) note : thank you for reading fukushima diary. fukushima diary is genuinely supported by your donation. monthly recurring donation is also appreciated. fukushima diary has been featuring the contaminated water issue since last summer and it’s been killing the web traffic of this site. lol however i cannot miss this issue. i’ll show you the three reasons before the pizza is delivered. 1, it increases the radiation dose of the plant area so that almost nobody can work. the groundwater is also contaminated and it’s rising to near the surface of the ground. tepco built the underground wall along the coastal line but it pushes the groundwater back to the land side. in some part of the seaside, workers already can’t work without the “stand” so that they don’t have to directly stand on the ground. and they also put the lead plate over the “stand”. also, the contaminated water tanks are extremely radioactive too. the radioactive material is packed in the tank, but when it hits water and steel, it turns to bremsstrahlung. workers are shot by bremsstrahlung even when they are just patrolling to find leakage. 2, the buoyancy damages the reactor buildings. as i wrote above, the rising contaminated water harms the soundness of plant buildings. fukushima plant is built on the artificially improved ground beside the sea. considering it went under the earthquake and tsunami, it

Article 9 - theory of corrosion and backflow through feedwater lines to explain fukushima radiactive water leaks
(before it's news) from nextbigfuture.com so how did reactor vessel water get into the pacific ocean? at dailykos by kbman when the plant(s) shutdown during the earthquake, their main steam line isolation valves would have shut immediately. (this theory applies to varying degrees to each plant.) the flow of water through the core would have switched to another cooling system which uses a heat exchanger to cool the reactor water. this and other similar systems were the ones which could not be used after the power failed. during normal operations steam flows out the top of the reactor in the main steam line which feeds the turbines. there are several devices involved and a number of turbine stages which use as much of the energy in the steam as it is practical to extract. the “dead” steam then passes through a condensing unit and heat exchange process to remove enough heat that it becomes water again. this is done by feeding the steam/condensate through a huge number of small tubes which are surrounded on their outside by cooling water drawn from the ocean. the ocean water absorbs the heat and carries it away and the condensate – water – is then pumped by the feedwater pumps back into the reactor. as i’ve mentioned a number of times in diaries and comments, the most immediate threat i see from corrosion is on valves and seals. and in this case i believe it is backward flow through the feedwater line that is transporting reactor water to the turbine building and also to the ocean

Article 1 - mishaps underscore weaknesses of japanese nuclear plant
plant workers dug these underground ponds about six months ago to store the ever-growing amount of contaminated water at the plant. there is about 400 tons daily from two sources: runoff from a makeshift cooling system rigged together after the site’s regular cooling equipment was knocked out by the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011, and a steady stream of groundwater seeping into damaged reactors. tepco stores more than a quarter-million tons of radioactive water at the site and says the amount could double within three years. but as outside experts have discovered with horror, the company had lined the pits for the underground pools with only two layers of plastic each 1.5 millimeters thick, and a third, clay-based layer just 6.5 millimeters thick. and because the pools require many sheets hemmed together, leaks could be springing at the seams, tepco has said. “no wonder the water is leaking,” said hideo komine, a professor in civil engineering at ibaraki university, just south of fukushima. he said that the outer protective lining should have been hundreds of times thicker. tepco’s president, naomi hirose, traveled to fukushima on wednesday to apologize for the leaks, which he said had caused further distress to local residents. about 160,000 fled their homes in the wake of the disaster, and large areas around the plant remain off-limits. photo mr. hirose said that tepco would stop using the underground pits

Article 3 - radioisotope recipe lacks one ingredient: cash
so the united states energy department, which regulates nuclear weapons, has been trying to find a way to make the molybdenum isotope without relying on leaky reactors that use bomb fuel. and in 2010 general electric, which designs power reactors, came up with an innovative solution. the commercial reactors have a big flow of neutrons, and if an atom of natural molybdenum absorbs one, it becomes moly 99. g.e.’s reactors have an opening at the bottom for an instrument that measures the neutron density. the company said it could replace that monitor with a “target” made of molybdenum and pull it back out after about seven days, so it could be sent to a chemical processing plant for recovery of the moly 99. the company even picked out a reactor, exelon’s clinton plant in dewitt county, ill. and it lined up industrial partners for the parts of the process it would not do itself, and tested the concept in research reactors. there is a drawback, though. only about 24 percent of natural molybdenum is moly 98, the kind that can be converted to moly 99. to produce a given volume of tech 99, the volume of molybdenum in the generator has to be far larger. enter another player: perma-fix, a company based in atlanta that makes a resin for treating contaminants at polluted industrial sites. photo the

Article 5 - danger posed by radioactivity in japan hard to assess
in the types of reactors involved, water is used to cool the reactor core and produce steam to turn the turbines that make electricity. the water contains two of the least dangerous radioactive materials now in the news — radioactive nitrogen and tritium. normal plant operations produce both of them in the cooling water, and they are even released routinely in small amounts into the environment, usually through tall chimneys. nitrogen is the most common gas in the earth’s atmosphere, and at a nuclear plant the main radioactive form is known as nitrogen-16. it is made when speeding neutrons from the reactor’s core hit oxygen in the surrounding cooling water. this radioactive form of nitrogen does not occur in nature. the danger of nitrogen-16 is an issue only for plant workers and operators because its half-life is only seven seconds. a half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive substance to disintegrate. the other radioactive material often in the cooling water of a nuclear reactor is tritium. it is a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen, sometimes known as heavy hydrogen. it is found in trace amounts in groundwater throughout the world. tritium emits a weak form of radiation that does not travel very far in the air and cannot penetrate the skin. it accumulates in the cooling water of nuclear reactors and is often vented in small amounts to the environment. its half-life is 12 years. the big worries on the reported releases of radioactive material in japan center on radioactive iodine and

Article 6 - lacey township: small radiation release at plant

Article 7 - science will catch up at waste site, u.s. says
the witness, mark t. peters, manager of the science and engineering test project at los alamos national laboratory, replied, ''i don't know if i'd say 'barely.' '' among the questions is whether to create a ''hot'' repository, packing the wastes together so that the radioactive decay -- which creates heat -- would keep the rock above the boiling point for a few hundred years. that would slow corrosion by keeping the metal containers dry, but could induce changes in the rock that could damage the canisters later. a ''cold'' repository, with wastes spaced more widely, might mean more corrosion in the early years. it would also cost more and mean more excavation, which releases radon gas, among other hazards. some scientists say the performance of a cold repository over thousands of years would be easier to predict. the department has not made a decision, partly because it has not tested the metal it has proposed for the canisters, alloy 22, at high temperatures. the nuclear industry and the energy department contend that a phased approach is appropriate and that technical problems can be resolved later. lake barrett, the acting head of the office of civilian radioactive waste management, said the design could be ''flexible.'' but another board member, norman l. christensen jr., a duke university ecology professor, said, ''in a regulatory world, flexibility can be a refuge from dealing with hard problems.'' the board said in a letter last week to the energy secretary and congressional leaders

Article 8 - mining companies back friend’s bid for senate
he has tried to block initiatives by the obama administration, with his most recent victory earlier this month when congress at least temporarily prohibited the department of labor from enforcing a new rule intended to combat black lung disease, blamed for 10,000 miners’ deaths in the past decade. and he is also trying to block proposed rules intended to help pay for the cleanup of toxic waste at abandoned mine sites or to prevent strip mines from contaminating streams. the congressman dismisses the regulatory proposals as excessive. “they put impediments in the way of reasonable development,” he said in an interview. “it is just a fundamental philosophical difference.” the industry has shown its gratitude for his vigilance. “he has been incredibly valuable to us,” said bud clinch, executive director of the montana coal council. just in the past two years, mining industry executives and the political action committees of companies including big players like murray energy, arch coal and cloud peak energy have donated nearly $100,000 to mr. rehberg’s senate campaign, making him one of the top recipients of mining money in congress and their favorite in the contest with mr. tester. but advocates for miner health and safety see his efforts differently. “he is more a spokesman for the industry than a lawmaker,” said robert guilfoyle, a retired montana miner who is now an official with the united mine workers union. “he is out here trying to cut us in the neck.” mining has been a part of mont

Article 9 - new jersey well-water testing
ms. bird pointed out that the law does not specify who is to pay for the test and does not require sellers whose test results indicate contamination to take any remedial action. ''if pollution is found in the well water,'' ms. bird said, ''the buyer and the seller are free to negotiate a remedy if one is desired.'' harvey klein, lab director for garden state laboratories in hillside, n.j., and a member of the state's environmental laboratory advisory committee, said the tests required by the law are fairly comprehensive and generally go well beyond the tests typically performed by a buyer before purchasing a property served by a private drinking well. ''before this law took effect, it was up to the buyer to determine what tests had to be run,'' mr. klein said. ''and, quite frankly, the average prospective homeowner had no idea what to test for.'' under the law, he said, the well must be tested for a number of contaminants and characteristics, including bacteria, ph, nitrates, iron, manganese, lead and any volatile organic compounds for which maximum contaminant levels have been established by state regulation. mr. klein said that when a certified lab tests drinking water, it must conduct an array of tests intended to identify different types of contamination. the first test, he said, is to determine the ph level. ''the ph test is important,'' mr. klein said, explaining that while the ph level -- which is a measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of the water

Article 10 - as finland builds another nuclear plant, a remote city flourishes

Japan's Nuclear Plant Leaks Raise Concerns Over Contaminated Water Storage

A recent investigation has revealed that a Japanese nuclear plant is storing over 400 tons of contaminated water daily, posing significant risks to the environment and human health. The plant's cooling system, damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, has been rigged together with makeshift solutions, leading to leaks and concerns over the stability of the underground storage pools.

Experts have criticized the plant's owner, Tepco, for using inadequate materials to line the pits, including only two layers of plastic and a clay-based layer just 6.5 millimeters thick. This has raised fears that the water could leak at the seams, contaminating the surrounding area.

Meanwhile, in Switzerland, voters have rejected a proposal to quickly exit the country's nuclear power plants, citing concerns over energy independence. The decision reflects a growing public awareness of the risks associated with nuclear energy and the need for more sustainable alternatives.

In the United States, scientists are working on developing new methods to produce radioisotopes without relying on leaky reactors. One innovative solution involves using a ""target"" made of molybdenum to capture neutrons, which can then be sent to a chemical processing plant for recovery.

However, concerns over radiation safety remain a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in areas with high levels of nuclear activity. A recent study highlighted the need for more comprehensive research into the environmental causes of breast cancer, including exposure to nuclear

Fukushima Nuclear Disaster: Leaks and Contamination Persist

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which suffered a devastating meltdown in 2011, continues to face significant challenges in containing radioactive leaks. A recent incident at the facility's Multiple Nuclide Removing System (MNS) revealed corrosion issues that led to a leak of radioactive materials just two months after its test operation began.

In another development, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator, reported a significant overflow of radioactive water from a container during a maintenance operation. The incident highlighted concerns about the facility's ability to contain and manage radioactive waste.

Furthermore, recent measurements have revealed high levels of tritium in the ocean surrounding the plant. Tritium, a radioactive isotope, has been detected at concentrations 200 times higher than normal levels in Biscayne Bay, near the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant in Florida.

Experts warn that contaminated water poses significant risks to workers and the environment. The use of frozen walls to contain radioactive materials has been proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness remains uncertain.

Investigations into leaks at other nuclear facilities have also raised concerns about the broader implications for public health and safety. As the Fukushima disaster continues to unfold, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the complex challenges posed by radioactive contamination.

4629878.0,fake,fake,0.8,123.4431426525116,True,"The article ""US Marines Killed in Taliban Attack on British Base"" is a clear fabrication of events, as it mentions Prince Harry being stationed at the base and US Marines killing insurgents during an attack. However, there is no record of such an incident occurring. In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE discusses various incidents involving the US military, including high-profile cases of brutality and accountability, but does not mention a specific attack on a British base in southern Afghanistan. The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE's content is more sensationalized and lacks factual accuracy, making it the most similar to a fake news article.","US Marines Killed in Taliban Attack on British Base

In a shocking incident, two US Marines were killed and several others wounded in an attack on a British military base in southern Afghanistan. The attack, which occurred at midnight local time, involved small arms fire and mortar or rocket-propelled grenades.

Prince Harry, who was stationed at the base, was not in any danger during the attack, according to Master Sergeant Bob Barko of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). However, two US Marines were killed in the attack, which has raised concerns about the safety of coalition forces in Afghanistan.

The incident highlights the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, where international forces are withdrawing and handing over areas to Afghan security forces. The attack also underscores the risks faced by military personnel serving in the region.

In a separate incident, 17 civilians were beheaded by insurgents in Helmand Province, allegedly for attending a dance party that flouted the extreme brand of Islam embraced by the militants. The killings are a reminder of the brutal interpretation of Islamic justice that can still be perpetrated by extremist groups in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, a US Navy medic who refused to deploy to Afghanistan due to his conscientious objections has had his fate decided. Michael Lyons, 24, was promoted to leading medical assistant and was set to deploy on March 1 but chose not to serve.

In another development, an Al-Qaeda leader accused the US government of denying him justice because a female guard escorted him to a recent court hearing in violation of his Islamic religious beliefs. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between the US and Al-Qaeda over issues of human rights and treatment of detainees.

These incidents highlight the complexities and challenges faced by military personnel serving in Afghanistan, where security threats are ever-present and the rules of engagement can be unclear.","US Military Faces Crisis of Trust and Accountability

A series of high-profile incidents has raised questions about the US military's culture of brutality and accountability. In Iraq, three American soldiers have been charged with premeditated murder and obstructing justice in connection with the deaths of three detainees. The incident highlights a broader issue of impunity within the military.

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, a NATO soldier was killed by an Afghan soldier wearing an official uniform, sparking concerns about the security situation on the ground. In Mali, former junta leader Amadou Sanogo is facing trial for complicity in kidnapping and assassination charges.

In the US, there have been reports of excessive use of force by military personnel, including the killing of civilians in Iraq. The incident has sparked debate about the need for greater accountability within the military.

The case of John Walker Lindh, also known as the ""American Taliban,"" has raised questions about the government's approach to prosecuting terrorism cases. His guilty plea to two counts of aiding enemies has been seen by some as a victory for the justice department, but others have questioned the strength of the evidence against him.

In Iraq, four US Marines are facing charges in connection with the deaths of 24 civilians during an insurgent raid. The incident has raised questions about the military's use of force and its relationship with local populations.

As the US military grapples with these issues, there is a growing need for greater transparency and accountability within the institution. The public must be informed about the actions of military personnel and the consequences of their actions.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

17 afghans beheaded in insurgent attack on party for dancing (before it's news) by heidi vogt and mirwais khankabul, afghanistan (ap) — insurgents beheaded 17 civilians in a taliban-controlled area of southern afghanistan, apparently because they attended a dance party that flouted the extreme brand of islam embraced by the militants, officials said monday. the killings, in a district where u.s. marines have battled the taliban for years, were a reminder of how much power the insurgent group still wields in the south — particularly as international forces draw down and hand areas over to afghan forces. the victims were part of a large group that had gathered late sunday in helmand province’s musa qala district for a celebration involving music and dancing, said district government chief neyamatullah khan. he said the taliban slaughtered them to show their disapproval of the event. all of the bodies were decapitated but it was not clear if they had been shot first, said provincial government spokesman daoud ahmadi. information was only trickling out slowly because the area where the killings occurred is largely taliban controlled, khan said. the taliban spokesman for southern afghanistan could not be reached for comment. many afghans and international observers have expressed worries that the taliban’s brutal interpretation of islamic justice will return as international forces withdraw. under the taliban, who ruled

Article 9 - militants free hundreds in attack on pakistan jail
(before it's news) almost 400 prisoners have escaped from a prison in pakistan after it was attacked by militants, officials say. at least 100 islamist militants launched the assault on the jail in north-west pakistan at 01:00 (20:00 gmt saturday). officials said some of the freed men were “dangerous” insurgents, including an inmate on death row for trying to kill ex-president pervez musharraf. the jail is located in bannu, a town in khyber pakhtunkhwa, which borders pakistan’s volatile tribal areas. on several occasions over the last year, the pakistani taliban have employed a similar tactic of using a large number of militants to attack a single site at the dead of night. in the past it has been military outposts close to the afghan border that were the target; this time it was even more audacious. police say the attackers went straight to the wing of the prison that housed death row inmates, including adnan rashid. he was a comparative rarity in pakistan: a man convicted for his part in a militant plot. those responsible for years of attacks in pakistan are seldom brought to book, and security failings are rarely fully acknowledged. that is likely to be the case again with the attack on the prison in bannu. it is yet another incident involving a supposedly secure compound that will make many wonder what, if anything is safe from the militants. pakistan’s taliban said they

kabul, afghanistan — after britain’s prince harry’s recent acknowledgement that he killed taliban insurgents on his latest tour of duty in iraq, general sir david richards, military chief of the united kingdom, told reporters yesterday that he deeply regrets jokingly identifying an afghan wedding party as a taliban regiment to the prince during a recent patrol. “the prince was moaning about how bloody dull the day had been, so i nudged him in the ribs and said ‘well, don’t look now, but there’s a nasty rag-head regiment right under your feet,’” said general richards. “i had no idea he’d open fire.” prince harry, who has consistently drawn praise for his excellent marksmanship skills as a co-pilot gunner throughout his tours of duty, proceeded to unload on the gathering from his hovering apache helicopter. he successfully gunned down a large number of wedding guests and literally shredding the groom in half with machine gun fire, splattering his dark, crimson blood all over the bride’s otherwise immaculate white wedding gown. instantly aware of his mistake, general richards took the rest of the apache’s crew aside and ordered them to continue the charade. “i made sure to penetrate the haze of unmitigated horror they were each going through and impress upon them the importance of ensuring that prince harry was forever unaware of the magnitude of his war crime,” he said. “though it was difficult for the boys to

the announcement yesterday that john walker lindh, the ''american taliban,'' had pleaded guilty to two counts of aiding our enemies can hardly be viewed as a victory for the justice department, which had once claimed that the case against mr. lindh could put him in prison for life. the government's statement that mr. lindh's maximum sentence of 20 years was proof, in the words of united states attorney paul mcnulty, of the ''strength of our case'' defies logic. more likely, the federal government never had a very sound case against mr. lindh. now, as the justice department prepares for what will likely be dozens of potential terrorism cases, there are mixed lessons to be learned from this case. first, even in this nebulous war on terrorism, evidence matters. since sept. 11, there have been significant debates within the government about whether our efforts should focus on intelligence gathering (to collect information that is not meant for use in prosecuting specific cases) or law enforcement efforts (gathering information to be used as trial evidence in accordance with strict constitutional mandates and court rules). which choice the government makes in any given case can determine the success of prosecution against an individual. in the lindh case, the government likely chose the federal courts in virginia because of their significant conservative bent in criminal and national security cases. in fact, it was the federal appellate court in virginia that last week upheld the government's argument that national security concerns justified not disclosing the names

Title: royal marine convicted of murder for finishing off seriously injured taliban insurgent (audio)
Content: royal marine convicted of murder for finishing off seriously injured taliban insurgent (audio) % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the british court martial board found a royal marine guilty of murder friday for shooting a badly injured afghan insurgent at close range during a six-month deployment in afghanistan in september 2011. “there you are. shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. it’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us,” the convicted marine said after firing one round into the insurgent’s chest. the three commandos involved in the shooting, identified only as marine a, b, and c, all denied committing what prosecutors called a “field execution.” marine a was convicted of murdering the captured afghan in helmand province, but marines b and c were acquitted following a two-week trial at the court martial center in bulford, wilthsire, the daily mail reported. video of the incident was reviewed by the court martial board but was deemed so disturbing that they feared releasing it to the public could “incite attacks” against other british troops. the murder took place after an apache helicopter laid down fire, launching 139 30mm anti-tank rounds at the insurgent who had on his person an ak-47, ammunition, and a grenade. following the helicopter attack, the three commandos carried out a “battle damage assessment” of the area and discovered the insurgent lying in a field and seriously wounded. footage from marine b’s helmet camera reportedly showed the afghan national on the ground, bloodied with eyes wide open and rolled back. according to marine a, the afghan was still alive and in order to avoid the watchful eyes of the helicopter hovering overhead, he was drug to the edge of the field and under the concealing canopy of the trees. marine a is heard asking, “anyone want to give first aid to this idiot?” marine b replied emphatically, “no.” marine c hovered over the insurgent and pointed a pistol at his head, asking marine a if he should shoot the afghan in the head, to which he replied, “that would be fucking obvious.” shortly after, marine a fired one round from his 9mm pistol into the man’s chest, then quoted a line from shakespeare, saying, “there you are. shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. it’s nothing you wouldn’t’ do to us.” the commandos dragged the injured afghan insurgent through a field and to the concealment of nearby trees, keeping their actions out of view from the watchful helicopter hovering above. marine a turned to his fellow commandos and said, “obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. i just broke the geneva convention.” it is uncertain if the afghan national would have survived if he hadn’t been shot by marine a, but according to a court statement from pathologist dr. nicholas hunt

US Marines Killed in Taliban Attack on British Base

In a shocking incident, two US Marines were killed and several others wounded in an attack on a British military base in southern Afghanistan. The attack, which occurred at midnight local time, involved small arms fire and mortar or rocket-propelled grenades.

Prince Harry, who was stationed at the base, was not in any danger during the attack, according to Master Sergeant Bob Barko of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). However, two US Marines were killed in the attack, which has raised concerns about the safety of coalition forces in Afghanistan.

The incident highlights the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, where international forces are withdrawing and handing over areas to Afghan security forces. The attack also underscores the risks faced by military personnel serving in the region.

In a separate incident, 17 civilians were beheaded by insurgents in Helmand Province, allegedly for attending a dance party that flouted the extreme brand of Islam embraced by the militants. The killings are a reminder of the brutal interpretation of Islamic justice that can still be perpetrated by extremist groups in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, a US Navy medic who refused to deploy to Afghanistan due to his conscientious objections has had his fate decided. Michael Lyons, 24, was promoted to leading medical assistant and was set to deploy on March 1 but chose not to serve.

In another development, an Al-Qaeda leader accused the US government of denying him justice because a female guard escorted him to a recent court hearing in

US Military Faces Crisis of Trust and Accountability

A series of high-profile incidents has raised questions about the US military's culture of brutality and accountability. In Iraq, three American soldiers have been charged with premeditated murder and obstructing justice in connection with the deaths of three detainees. The incident highlights a broader issue of impunity within the military.

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, a NATO soldier was killed by an Afghan soldier wearing an official uniform, sparking concerns about the security situation on the ground. In Mali, former junta leader Amadou Sanogo is facing trial for complicity in kidnapping and assassination charges.

In the US, there have been reports of excessive use of force by military personnel, including the killing of civilians in Iraq. The incident has sparked debate about the need for greater accountability within the military.

The case of John Walker Lindh, also known as the ""American Taliban,"" has raised questions about the government's approach to prosecuting terrorism cases. His guilty plea to two counts of aiding enemies has been seen by some as a victory for the justice department, but others have questioned the strength of the evidence against him.

In Iraq, four US Marines are facing charges in connection with the deaths of 24 civilians during an insurgent raid. The incident has raised questions about the military's use of force and its relationship with local populations.

As the US military grapples with these issues, there is a growing need for greater transparency and accountability within the institution. The public must be informed about the actions

9191915.0,reliable,fake,0.9,127.04386258125304,False," The article ""A Tense Time for Politics"" is the most similar to the fake news article in style and content. Both articles focus on speculation about Barack Obama's presidency, including his tone, appointments, and interactions with celebrities. The language used in both articles is also sensationalized, with phrases like ""surge in tensions,"" ""thinly veiled attempt to ridicule opponents,"" and ""it sounds like a joke."" Additionally, the article mentions specific individuals, such as George Clooney and Lady Gaga, who are quoted as expressing concerns about Obama's presidency. This level of specificity and attention-grabbing language is typical of fake news articles.  In contrast, the reliable news article provides factual information about Barack Obama's background, campaign promises, and potential appointments, without sensationalizing or speculating about his presidency. The tone is more neutral and informative, providing context for readers to understand the significance of Obama's election.","A Tense Time for Politics

The recent weeks have seen a surge in tensions between politicians and the media. A prominent figure, known for his sharp wit, took to the stage at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, using humor to deflect from his own insecurities. However, some critics argue that this approach is a thinly veiled attempt to ridicule opponents.

Meanwhile, the world of entertainment has been abuzz with celebrities speaking out against the incoming administration. George Clooney, known for his outspoken views, recently called out the president-elect, saying ""aren't you supposed to be running the country?"" This sentiment was echoed by other stars, including Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lawrence, who have expressed concerns about the nation's future.

In a surprising move, President Barack Obama has announced that he will co-moderate the fifth GOP debate with comedian Jon Stewart. The debate is set to focus on foreign policy, and many are eager to see how the seasoned politician will handle the questions.

As the election season heats up, both sides are feeling the pressure. A recent email from a prominent campaign committee highlighted the growing divide between supporters of the two parties. With the stakes higher than ever, it's clear that this is a time for politicians to put aside their differences and engage in constructive dialogue.

However, with the rise of social media, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. As one observer noted, ""it sounds like a joke"" when a high-ranking official is tasked with lecturing on ethical leadership. The line between humor and hostility is often blurred, leaving many wondering what's next for this tumultuous time in politics.

In the end, it's up to the American people to decide which path they want to take. As one supporter of the opposition party put it, ""we can't let the other side claim the momentum."" The fate of the nation hangs in the balance, and only time will tell what the future holds.","Washington D.C. is bracing for the arrival of a new president, Barack Obama, who will take office on January 20th. As he prepares to assume his role, many are wondering what tone he will set in the White House.

In contrast to previous presidents, Obama's background as a community organizer and senator from Illinois has given him a unique perspective on the country's problems. His campaign focused on issues such as healthcare reform and economic recovery, which have resonated with voters.

However, not everyone is convinced that Obama is the right man for the job. Some critics argue that he lacks experience in foreign policy, having only recently returned to Washington after serving as a senator. Others question his ability to work with Congress, given his reputation for being a strong-willed leader.

Despite these concerns, many believe that Obama's charisma and eloquence will help him build bridges with lawmakers and the public. His speech on Wednesday night was seen as a promising start, in which he reminded voters of his commitment to economic reform and his desire to work across party lines.

As the country prepares for its first African American president, there is also speculation about who will be appointed to key positions in the administration. Will Hollywood stars take up residence in the Lincoln Bedroom, as they did during the Clinton years? Only time will tell.

One thing is certain: Obama's presidency will be marked by a mix of humor and stern exhortation, as he seeks to balance his desire for change with the need for pragmatism in governance. As he takes office, Americans are eager to see how he will navigate the complexities of the White House.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

alinksyite-in-chief entertains media alinskyites with poorly disguised alinsky tactics they try to pass of as humor. % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the white house correspondents’ dinner is perpetually a phony baloney affair, just like the old dean martin roasts but without the actual humor, but including the fake laughter from all in attendance. presidents who are self-confident usually employ self-effacing humor for the most part, poking fun at themselves to try to make themselves appear more human and down to earth, with varying degrees of success. but obama is not self-confident. he’s a tiny little mean man with a chip on his shoulder. he’s self-concious. so rather than direct the barbs toward himself, he flipped through his copy of saul alinsky’s ‘rules for comics’ and happened upon rule 5, ‘ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.’ and shecky obama used it mercilessly against donald trump, who was sitting in the audience and was not given a chance to respond. very un-presidential. so what else is new? look. i am not a fan of donald trump and do not wish him to continue his quest for the presidency. i question whether trump is a double agent, as he has a well documented record of lavishing democrats with lots of money and holding lots of traditional liberal positions in the

new york, ny. – during a democratic fundraiser in new york last monday, president barack obama announced he has signed a contract with cnn to co-moderate the fifth gop debate with former daily show host jon stewart. set for december 15th in las vegas, nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy. “they need a little touch of reality,” the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. “this isn’t an audition for the babysitter’s club, it’s the oval office.” in the past, president obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current republican presidential hopefuls possess the “intellectual and moral fortitude” required to run the country. “presidential debates shouldn’t be centered around catering to the candidates’ comfort level,” said cnn political analyst melissa cunningham, referring to the most recent cnbc debate which prompted a failed attempt by the gop to harness control of future debates. cunningham continued, “it’ll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job they’re vying for.” meanwhile, former vice presidential nominee and reality tv star sarah palin railed against the obama administration for “once again trying to sandbag the republican party” and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer. former daily show host jon stewart, who many speculate will play “good cop” to

Article 1 - seth meyers’s promise to donald trump
for the last 18 months, comedy’s relationship with the presidential election has been an uneasy one. some late-night hosts, like jimmy fallon and james corden, have largely avoided its darker implications, plowing on with less uncomfortable humor to try and unite a polarized audience. others, like john oliver and samantha bee, have been polemical, offering an unfiltered point of view applauded for its honesty, if pitched at a smaller crowd. late night with seth meyers has tended toward the latter approach, with its host clearly articulating his left-leaning point of view and taking apart many of trump’s stated policies. last night, in his first broadcast since trump’s election, meyers gave a 10-minute speech that could help chart a path for the next four years in his job. he was at once sharply funny and nakedly emotional. he made an effort to speak to trump supporters without seeming entirely condescending. he acknowledged that in his position as a well-off white guy, his anguish at the electoral result was not the only perspective required on the night. he told jokes, of course, but with the awareness that jokes alone won’t be what his audience needs going forward. in the last two days, much ink has been spilled on the notion that society has become excessively blinkered, sectioned off by social media that echoes back like-minded thinking at everyone who uses it. before the election, the same was said of shows like full frontal or late night

Article 2 - gormley works up a sweat in a crowded but obscure senate field
no one has ever accused mr. gormley of failing to make an impression. a powerful atlantic city lawmaker who heads the judiciary committee in the state senate, mr. gormley, 54, is well known in trenton for his fiery temperament, intense exchanges and the ability to strategize like a military field commander under siege. ''bill doesn't bumble or fumble,'' said senator gerald cardinale, a bergen county republican who counts himself a gormley supporter. ''when he focuses on something he wants to get done, it gets done.'' beyond his hurricane-size persona, mr. gormley has another trait that sets him apart from his primary rivals: a knack for raising money. so far he has collected $2.4 million; robert d. franks, the united states representative from union county who is considered the other front-runner, has raised just under $1.6 million. in a race that features three like-minded moderates -- mr. gormley, mr. franks and james w. treffinger, the essex county executive -- and a former libertarian, murray sabrin, mr. gormley's stockpile of cash will buy the kind of commercials that makes all the difference in new jersey, a state that, depending on geography, gets its network television from new york and philadelphia. as the gatekeeper of legislation affecting atlantic city, mr. gormley has benefited from casino industry largess, prompting

Article 3 - political notebook; bush runs, with a lexicon of his own
was that not the same as lying? ''i'm just disappointed,'' mr. bush said, with a ''nice-try'' twinkle and grin. ''i think that's the word i'd like to use. it's a disappointing thing.'' mr. bush, a savvy enough candidate, understands that in politics, diction establishes tone, and tone is everything. and he turns to euphemisms to resolve inherent tensions in his campaign, like his pledge to run a positive race and his simultaneous resolve to wage an aggressive fight that exposes what he believes to be mr. gore's shortcomings. he did the same thing in the primaries, watering down the nouns and verbs he used to describe and disparage his principal opponent, senator john mccain of arizona. mr. bush's mantra at the time was that mr. mccain ''says one thing and does another.'' did that not make the arizona senator a ''hypocrite''? mr. bush flinched at the mere suggestion. no, he said, it made the senator a man practiced in the ways of ''washington,'' a word that was perhaps dirtier but much less explicitly mean-spirited. support from far away throughout the republican primaries, the bush campaign trumpeted seemingly any and every endorsement, whether it came from the governor of a large state or the secretary of a small sewing circle. but last week, the bush campaign took that tendency to the outer limits. mr. bush showed reporters in the back of

Article 4 - the new republic’s ugly reality
exclusive: mainstream pundits are outraged over a silicon valley barbarian riding in and defacing the new republic, a temple to all that is wonderful about deep-thinking policymaking and long-form journalism. but the truth about the washington-based magazine is much less honorable, writes robert parry. by robert parry there has been much handwringing of late in official washington about an editorial shakeup at the new republic and the possibility that the century-old political magazine’s legacy will somehow be tarnished by its new owner. but the truth about the new republic is that it has more blood on its hands than almost any other publication around, which is saying something. in my four decades in national journalism that’s two-fifths of the new republic’s life what i have seen from the magazine is mostly its smug advocacy for u.s. interventionism abroad and snarky putdowns of antiwar skeptics at home. indeed, you could view the new republic as the most productive hothouse for cultivating neoconservative dogma — and at least partly responsible for the senseless slaughter associated with that ideology. though the new republic still touts its reputation as “liberal,” that label has been essentially a cover for its real agenda: pushing a hawkish foreign policy agenda that included the reagan administration’s slaughter of central americans in the 1980s, violent u.s. interventions in iraq, syria and other muslim countries for the past two decades, and israel’s

Article 5 - sex! drugs! (and maybe a little war)
“charlie wilson’s war” is not as didactic as many of the others and is set in a pre-9/11 world. based on the late george crile’s best seller, it is about a square-jawed democratic congressman from texas who used his seat on a military appropriations subcommittee during the 1980s to secretly steer more than a billion dollars to finance the mujahadeen rebellion in afghanistan against the invading soviet army. if “charlie wilson’s war,” with a budget of $75 million, is a commercial success, its creators will have found a winning formula. you can make a movie that is relevant and intelligent — and palatable to a mass audience — if its political pills are sugar-coated, in this case thanks to mr. wilson’s high jinks, his sometime romance with a right-wing socialite played by ms. roberts and his escapades with a coarse c.i.a. officer played by mr. hoffman. but hollywood has long found it tricky to find the balance between being taken seriously on geopolitics without falling short on what movies are supposed to do: entertain. photo this calibration was always on the minds of the veteran director, mike nichols, and the writer of the screenplay, aaron sorkin. mr. sorkin opens the movie with an unforgettable scene in the book that features mr. wilson and showgirls in an enormous jacuzzi at caes

yet the democratic establishment here is still oriented around former president bill clinton and his wife, senator hillary rodham clinton. just four years ago, mr. obama was a state senator from illinois. after nearly two years on the campaign trail, he remains, here in washington, an outsider, a virtual unknown. “is there anybody in washington that really knows them? no, which is a very interesting thing,’ esther coopersmith, who has raised millions for the clintons and other democrats, including senator joseph r. biden jr. of delaware, the vice president-elect, said of the obamas. “he went home every weekend, or he went campaigning and was never here, and she lived in chicago,” she said. so washington is left to imagine what cultural tone the obamas will set. will bruce springsteen perform at the inaugural — or maybe yo-yo ma? will mr. obama make frequent use of the presidential box at the kennedy center? (laura bush often went, accompanied by friends, while her husband stayed home.) or will the obamas, whose idea of fun is playing board games with their daughters, be the type to stay in at night, helping the kids with their homework? will hollywood stars take up residence in the lincoln bedroom, the way they did during the clinton years? “he’s a cool cat,” said christopher buckley, the political humorist, “and

Article 7 - ask not what j.f.k. can do for obama
in other words, kennedy needed two things. he needed poetry, and he needed a country with some desire, however vague, for change. mr. goodwin and his fellow speechwriter ted sorensen helped with the poetry. still, the placid america of 1960 was not obviously in the market for change. the outgoing president, ike, was the most popular incumbent since f. d. r. the suburban boom was as glossy as it is now depicted in the television show “mad men.” the red panic of the mccarthy years was in temporary remission. photo but kennedy’s intuition was right. america’s boundless self-confidence was being rattled by (as yet) low-grade fevers: the surprise soviet technological triumph of sputnik; anti-american riots in even friendly non-communist countries; the arrest of martin luther king jr. at an all-white restaurant in atlanta ; the inexorable national shift from manufacturing to white-collar jobs. kennedy bet his campaign on, as he put it, “the single assumption that the american people are uneasy at the present drift in our national course” and “that they have the will and strength to start the united states moving again.” for all the barack obama -j. f. k. comparisons, whether legitimate or over-the-top, what has often been forgotten is that mr. obama’s weaknesses resemble kennedy’s at least as much as his strengths. but to

Article 8 - alan grayson, the liberals’ problem child
some democrats also say that mr. grayson fills a void, defying their party’s inferiority complex, the constant sense that liberals just are not tough enough. they say that as an attention-grabbing motivator of the party’s base, he could prove hugely useful in getting out the message for next year’s midterm elections. “there is always a feeling among liberals, a psychology that we are too apologetic; we see six sides to the pentagon,” said james carville, the democratic operative and commentator, who met mr. grayson in a cnn studio shortly after the “die quickly” speech in congress. photo “he was smart; he’s not just a crank,” mr. carville said. “he wanted to be anything but an apologetic, ‘if i said anything that offended anybody’ kind of liberal.” mr. carville added that party leaders will view mr. grayson as a “torpedo” they can deploy, especially if democrats lose important governors’ races this week. “we need guys like that out there,” he said. not everyone thinks so. mr. grayson joins colleagues like michele bachmann, republican of minnesota; pete stark, democrat of california; and joe wilson, republican of south carolina, in what the decorum-minded see as a bipartisan playpen reserved for political problem children. so for party leaders, the behavior often forces a question: do you cheer, or wince,

Article 10 - trying to prove he’s the same old obama
he is known for giving eloquent speeches, and also for a professorial coolness when explaining policy details. wednesday night, mr. obama used a mix of humor and stern exhortation to remind voters why they elected him — even as he promised that he would not let electoral politics derail economic reform. it was a populist message delivered with patrician restraint, a presidential performance tinged with a little of the anti-establishment zeal of the tea party movement — a green tea movement. “and if there’s one thing that has unified democrats and republicans, it’s that we all hated the bank bailout,” mr. obama said. “i hated it. you hated it. it was about as popular as a root canal.” the republican response was almost as carefully choreographed as the president’s address — mindful of last year’s much-ridiculed performance by gov. bobby jindal of louisiana. photo this time, gov. robert f. mcdonnell of virginia spoke from the state house surrounded by a winsome, multicultural selection of colleagues and supporters who clapped throughout, as if at a state of the union of their own. mr. mcdonnell was respectful of the president, even pointing out where he and his party agreed with mr. obama, but cast his objections as a populist protest against big government. “what government should not do is pile on more taxation, regulation and litigation that kill jobs and hurt the middle

Washington D.C. is bracing for the arrival of a new president, Barack Obama, who will take office on January 20th. As he prepares to assume his role, many are wondering what tone he will set in the White House.

In contrast to previous presidents, Obama's background as a community organizer and senator from Illinois has given him a unique perspective on the country's problems. His campaign focused on issues such as healthcare reform and economic recovery, which have resonated with voters.

However, not everyone is convinced that Obama is the right man for the job. Some critics argue that he lacks experience in foreign policy, having only recently returned to Washington after serving as a senator. Others question his ability to work with Congress, given his reputation for being a strong-willed leader.

Despite these concerns, many believe that Obama's charisma and eloquence will help him build bridges with lawmakers and the public. His speech on Wednesday night was seen as a promising start, in which he reminded voters of his commitment to economic reform and his desire to work across party lines.

As the country prepares for its first African American president, there is also speculation about who will be appointed to key positions in the administration. Will Hollywood stars take up residence in the Lincoln Bedroom, as they did during the Clinton years? Only time will tell.

One thing is certain: Obama's presidency will be marked by a mix of humor and stern exhortation, as he seeks to balance his desire for change with the need for prag

A Tense Time for Politics

The recent weeks have seen a surge in tensions between politicians and the media. A prominent figure, known for his sharp wit, took to the stage at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, using humor to deflect from his own insecurities. However, some critics argue that this approach is a thinly veiled attempt to ridicule opponents.

Meanwhile, the world of entertainment has been abuzz with celebrities speaking out against the incoming administration. George Clooney, known for his outspoken views, recently called out the president-elect, saying ""aren't you supposed to be running the country?"" This sentiment was echoed by other stars, including Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lawrence, who have expressed concerns about the nation's future.

In a surprising move, President Barack Obama has announced that he will co-moderate the fifth GOP debate with comedian Jon Stewart. The debate is set to focus on foreign policy, and many are eager to see how the seasoned politician will handle the questions.

As the election season heats up, both sides are feeling the pressure. A recent email from a prominent campaign committee highlighted the growing divide between supporters of the two parties. With the stakes higher than ever, it's clear that this is a time for politicians to put aside their differences and engage in constructive dialogue.

However, with the rise of social media, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and opinion. As one observer noted, ""it sounds like a joke"" when a high-ranking official is tasked with lect

The article ""Cyprus Teeters on Brink of Financial Collapse"" is more reliable because it:  1. Provides specific details about the government's plan and the reactions from various parties. 2. Mentions specific figures, such as the European Central Bank's threat to cut off short-term financing if a bailout deal is not reached by Monday. 3. Includes quotes from officials, which adds credibility to the article.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Cyprus Fiasco Raises Concerns About Eurozone Stability"" contains several red flags that indicate it is not reliable:  1. It makes general statements about the eurozone stability without providing specific details or facts. 2. It includes unsubstantiated claims about Germany's demands on Cyprus and their potential impact on Greece's EEZ. 3. It raises concerns about geopolitics and illicit financial activities, which are not supported by concrete evidence.  Overall, while both articles discuss the Cyprus financial crisis, ""Cyprus Teeters on Brink of Financial Collapse"" is more reliable due to its specific details,","Cyprus Fiasco Raises Concerns About Eurozone Stability

The recent crisis in Cyprus has raised concerns about the stability of the eurozone. The small island nation's banks were pushed to the edge of default due to their exposure to heavily devalued Greek bonds, prompting a massive bailout from international lenders.

However, the bailout came with harsh conditions, including a ""haircut"" on bank deposits and a ban on withdrawals. This move has sparked widespread outrage among depositors, who feel that they are being unfairly penalized for the actions of their banks.

The crisis in Cyprus is not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger trend of economic instability in Europe. The European Union's handling of the crisis has been criticized for its lack of transparency and cooperation between member states.

Germany's demands on Cyprus have been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to challenge Greece's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and enhance American-backed energy exploitation in the region. This move has raised concerns about the geopolitics of the eurozone and the potential for further instability.

The crisis in Cyprus also highlights the need for greater cooperation between European countries on issues such as banking regulation, tax evasion, and money laundering. The island nation's reputation as a haven for Islamist refugees and its close relationship with Moscow have made it a hub for illicit financial activities.

As the eurozone continues to grapple with economic instability, the crisis in Cyprus serves as a reminder of the need for greater transparency, cooperation, and accountability among member states.","Cyprus Teeters on Brink of Financial Collapse

The island nation is facing a severe financial crisis, with its two main banks, Laiki and Bank of Cyprus, struggling to stay afloat. The European Central Bank has threatened to cut off short-term financing if a bailout deal is not reached by Monday.

President Nicos Anastasiades met with political parties on Saturday night to explain the plan, which includes seizing a portion of high-level deposits to raise funds for a bailout. Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said significant progress had been made towards reaching an agreement with European officials.

However, the move has sparked widespread protests, with demonstrators chanting ""resign! resign!"" outside the presidential palace. The government is under pressure to address concerns about the impact on thousands of jobs and the potential for a devastating haircut on big depositors.

Turkey, which has long been involved in efforts to reunify the island, has offered new proposals aimed at lifting restrictions on freedom of goods, persons, and services. Greek Cypriots have rejected previous attempts at a settlement, but Anastasiades says he is optimistic about the prospects for a deal.

Meanwhile, Greece has expressed openness to talks with Turkey on the issue, with officials saying they are ""open"" to negotiations. The UN Secretary-General has also urged caution, suggesting an extra week may be needed to reach a deadline.

As the crisis deepens, Germany and other European countries are locked in a fierce debate over whether to throw Cyprus a lifeline. The Russian government has provided a $3.5 billion loan, but concerns about the potential for ""black Russian money"" to end up in the hands of oligarchs and gangsters have sparked controversy.

With time running out, EU leaders have set a two-week deadline for Turkey to drop trade curbs on Cyprus or risk the breakdown of its European Union membership bid.

given the public unrest of the last few days, it would appear that the cypriot government, having tried and failed with plan a (wealth tax versions 1 and 2) and plan b (beg the russians directly), they have decided to go with plan c (collateralized cypriot obligations). the current proposal, ekathimerini reports, to theoretically be voted on in a few hours (about to be in cabinet), is that cyprus will form an investment fund to raise the capital needed to payoff their eu overlords. this fund will be collateralized by state assets, possibly including natural gas revenues, church property, and social security fund reserves. though some form of deposit tax was ‘apparently’ not ruled out, it seems the next last best hope for cyprus is begging the russians to extend a loan and begging the world to fund more debt from a nation about to see huge capital outflows. the approach is, it appears, a ‘solidarity’ approach – rather than tax the current wealth of depositors (and hand it over to troika), ‘tax’ the future possibility of wealth creation and sell that to the next greater fool sovereign wealth fund (or will the ecb decide that these ccos are acceptable collateral?) via ekathimerini, political leaders in cyprus have agreed that their country should form an investment fund to raise the capital needed to agree a bailout with the eurozone and international monetary fund and avert a collapse of

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! authored by metin gurcan via al-monitor.com, the eastern mediterranean is expected to witness the first conflict of 2018, as developments at the end of 2017 are signaling worsening relationships between turkey and the greek cypriot-greece-israel-egypt bloc. territorial disputes over natural gas and newly discovered hydrocarbon reserves in the eastern mediterranean basin are the reason. up until a few years ago, the hope was that these hydrocarbon reserves would offer a real opportunity for a peaceful settlement of the cyprus conflict. but these optimistic hopes vanished with both turks and greek cypriots unilaterally speeding up exploration and drilling operations. in 2004, the european union had declared the greek cypriots the sole entity representing the island of cyprus and accepted it as an eu member. feeling that its hand has been strengthened following the eu decision, the greek cypriots claimed the right of natural resources exploration in the exclusive economic zone (eez) around cyprus. turkey, however, has been insisting that the greek cypriot administration in nicosia cannot unilaterally “adopt laws regarding the exploitation of natural resources on behalf of the entire island,” as it doesn’t represent the turkish cypriots. also, there is a separate disputed eez between turkey and greece in the eastern mediterranean — another

cyprus’s president, nicos anastasiades, was meeting saturday night with political parties to explain the plan. he was scheduled to fly to brussels on sunday. cyprus’s finance minister, michalis sarris, said on saturday that there had been “significant progress toward reaching an agreement” with european officials on raising money for a bailout. all parties were working against a deadline imposed by the european central bank, which has said it will cut off crucial short-term financing to cyprus’s teetering commercial banks on monday if a bailout deal is not reached by then. facing what he has called the worst crisis for cyprus since the 1974 turkish invasion, mr. anastasiades said on saturday on his twitter account: “we are undertaking great efforts. i hope we will have a resolution soon.” a noisy crowd, estimated at around 2,000 people, gathered outside the presidential palace in the early evening, far more than the hundreds who had gathered there in recent days. with flanks of riot police standing guard, many demonstrators chanted, “resign! resign!” as they inveighed against the imminent consolidation of the laiki bank, one of cyprus’s biggest and most troubled lenders. in a move demanded by the i.m.f., which will cost thousands of jobs, the toxic assets of laiki will be hived off into a so-called bad bank, while healthy assets and accounts will be moved to the bank of cy

Article 2 - turkey and cyprus
to the editor: re ''the way forward for turkey'' (editorial, jan. 31): you are absolutely right in urging movement on the cyprus issue. indeed, turkey is already blazing this trail with new ideas to end the stalemate. last month, we put forth a new set of proposals that aim simultaneously to lift all restrictions on freedom of goods, persons and services by all relevant parties in the context of the cyprus issue. since 2004, when turkish cypriots endorsed a united nations settlement plan but greek cypriots rejected it, turkish cypriots have awaited steps by the international community to end their economic isolation, while greek cypriots have blocked all such efforts. this latest turkish initiative aims to improve the lives of all cypriots. we hope that it will prompt the united nations into action not only for its implementation but also to help restart negotiations toward a comprehensive settlement. nabi sensoy ambassador of turkey washington, feb. 7, 2006

Article 3 - greece 'open' to turkey talks on cyprus: official
athens (afp) - greece is ""open"" for talks with turkey on the issue of divided cyprus, athens said tuesday a day after key negotiations between the island's rival leaders ended without a deal. ""we think this issue is open, we will proceed carefully,"" government spokesman dimitris tzanakopoulos told reporters. he had been asked about speculation that greek prime minister alexis tsipras was arranging to meet turkish president recep tayyip erdogan, reportedly on december 4. tzanakopoulos said that during a phonecall with erdogan on friday, tsipras ""expressed desire for a bilateral meeting"" but added that no specific date had been set. ""after yesterday's (breakdown in talks) we will see what happens,"" the spokesman said. the much-heralded talks in the swiss resort of mont pelerin between greek cypriot leader nicos anastasiades and his turkish cypriot counterpart mustafa akinci were supposed to produce a map of the internal boundaries of a future federation and pave the way for broader talks aimed at reaching a deal by early next year. but like the five days of negotiations earlier in november, the two-day session broke up in the early hours of tuesday without progress, and with each side blaming the other. cyprus has been divided since 1974, when turkish troops invaded the northern third of the island in response

Article 4 - in cyprus, big losses expected on deposits
at laiki bank, which is even worse off, about 4 billion euros of deposits will be put in a bad bank and are most likely to be wiped out as the bank is wound down. debt experts say that as painful as such a trimming may be, it still may not be enough to guarantee the viability of the bank of cyprus, given the state of the economy. “if you are not hugely conservative with regard to valuing bank of cyprus’s assets, the bank will be insolvent in 12 months,” said adam lerrick, a sovereign debt specialist at the american enterprise institute in washington. as of the third quarter of 2012, problem loans for the bank were 22 percent of the total, one of the highest ratios in the euro zone. that figure will have grown significantly over the last several months, economists here say. adding to the sense of confusion enfolding the country’s financial sector, the chairman of the bank of cyprus resigned abruptly tuesday after a showdown with mr. demetriades, the head of the central bank, and the finance ministry. the bank chairman, andreas artemis, complained that the authorities rode roughshod over him and his board by moving unilaterally to sell off units of the bank in greece and for planning to impose the devastating haircut on big depositors. in a statement later in the day, the bank said mr. artemis’s resignation had not been accepted and “will only apply if

(source: yiannis kourtoglou/pool photo via ap) turkey’s input will be pivotal in overcoming key obstacles preventing a deal to reunify ethnically divided cyprus, the island’s president said friday ahead of crucial talks in switzerland next week. nicos anastasiades, a greek cypriot, says he and breakaway turkish cypriot leader mustafa akinci have made significant progress on numerous issues making an envisioned federation workable. those issues include ensuring the country’s economic viability and the right of all citizens to live and work wherever they choose. watch what else is in the news but he said it’ll take the “resolute contribution” of turkey and the turkish cypriot leadership to reach agreement on core issues such as security and how much territory either side will administer under an envisioned federal state. five days of intensive, un-backed talks in the swiss resort of mont pelerin will concentrate directly on territory issues. officials say sufficient progress on this key issue would pave the way for a final summit to hammer out a comprehensive deal encompassing security matters. un secretary-general ban ki

Article 8 - question of aiding cyprus places germany in a bind
the question of keeping the euro together had seemed to be conveniently fading for ms. merkel, who in the fall put her full backing behind the euro zone, quieting fears of a breakup. but berlin seems to have been caught off guard by the political tempest stirred up by cyprus, which has been shut out of international bond markets for a year but has been kept afloat by a $3.5 billion loan from the russian government. with that money running out, germany and its european partners have been locked in a fierce debate over whether and how to throw cyprus a lifeline. the problem is, most of the money lost by cypriot banks was russian, and the worry is that most of the bailout money could wind up in the hands of russian oligarchs and gangsters. that fear, backed by a recent report by german intelligence, has stoked a furor even among some of ms. merkel’s political partners. “i do not want to vouch for black russian money,” volker kauder, a prominent member of her conservative bloc, said recently. the russian presence is thick on cyprus, a picturesque mediterranean island and a onetime british colony. the bustling, large city of limassol has an enclave of restaurants, shops and fur boutiques so packed with russians that locals call it “limassolgrad.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email

Cyprus Teeters on Brink of Financial Collapse

The island nation is facing a severe financial crisis, with its two main banks, Laiki and Bank of Cyprus, struggling to stay afloat. The European Central Bank has threatened to cut off short-term financing if a bailout deal is not reached by Monday.

President Nicos Anastasiades met with political parties on Saturday night to explain the plan, which includes seizing a portion of high-level deposits to raise funds for a bailout. Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said significant progress had been made towards reaching an agreement with European officials.

However, the move has sparked widespread protests, with demonstrators chanting ""resign! resign!"" outside the presidential palace. The government is under pressure to address concerns about the impact on thousands of jobs and the potential for a devastating haircut on big depositors.

Turkey, which has long been involved in efforts to reunify the island, has offered new proposals aimed at lifting restrictions on freedom of goods, persons, and services. Greek Cypriots have rejected previous attempts at a settlement, but Anastasiades says he is optimistic about the prospects for a deal.

Meanwhile, Greece has expressed openness to talks with Turkey on the issue, with officials saying they are ""open"" to negotiations. The UN Secretary-General has also urged caution, suggesting an extra week may be needed to reach a deadline.

As the crisis deepens, Germany and other European countries are locked in a fierce debate over whether to throw Cyprus a lifeline. The

Cyprus Fiasco Raises Concerns About Eurozone Stability

The recent crisis in Cyprus has raised concerns about the stability of the eurozone. The small island nation's banks were pushed to the edge of default due to their exposure to heavily devalued Greek bonds, prompting a massive bailout from international lenders.

However, the bailout came with harsh conditions, including a ""haircut"" on bank deposits and a ban on withdrawals. This move has sparked widespread outrage among depositors, who feel that they are being unfairly penalized for the actions of their banks.

The crisis in Cyprus is not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger trend of economic instability in Europe. The European Union's handling of the crisis has been criticized for its lack of transparency and cooperation between member states.

Germany's demands on Cyprus have been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to challenge Greece's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and enhance American-backed energy exploitation in the region. This move has raised concerns about the geopolitics of the eurozone and the potential for further instability.

The crisis in Cyprus also highlights the need for greater cooperation between European countries on issues such as banking regulation, tax evasion, and money laundering. The island nation's reputation as a haven for Islamist refugees and its close relationship with Moscow have made it a hub for illicit financial activities.

As the eurozone continues to grapple with economic instability, the crisis in Cyprus serves as a reminder of the need for greater transparency, cooperation, and accountability among member states

Both articles mention Macy's department stores, their products, and the company's efforts to increase sales and profitability. Additionally, both articles discuss consumer confidence, economic factors, and the impact of interest rates on spending habits. The language and tone of the two articles are also similar, with a focus on providing factual information about the retail sector.  The article ""US Retail Sees Resurgence in Holiday Season"" appears to be more sensationalized and focused on highlighting a specific trend (holiday sales) rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the retail sector. The language used is more promotional and less objective, which suggests that it may not be as reliable as the other two articles.  Overall, while both ""US Retail Sees Resurgence in Holiday Season"" and ""Retailers Bounce Back as Consumers Boost Spending"" are news articles, the latter appears to be a more accurate and comprehensive representation of the retail sector.","US Retail Sees Resurgence in Holiday Season

The US retail sector has seen a significant resurgence in the holiday season, with sales exceeding expectations. According to recent reports, American shoppers spent an estimated $800 billion during this period, a 4.9% increase from last year.

Retailers such as Macy's and Target reported double-digit sales increases, driven by warmer weather and rising consumer confidence. Online retail sales also saw significant growth, with Amazon reporting its biggest holiday shopping season ever.

The resurgence in retail sales is a welcome surprise for the industry, which had been struggling in recent years. The National Retail Federation had predicted a 3.9% increase in November and December sales, but many retailers exceeded expectations.

The strong performance of US retailers has also been driven by consumer confidence, with lower unemployment figures and early discounts at stores contributing to the surge in spending. The middle class, which had been struggling in recent years, appears to be showing signs of reengagement, with consumers buying goods and services they needed or wanted.

Overall, the holiday season has seen a significant boost for US retailers, with many reporting strong sales and increased consumer confidence. This trend is expected to continue into the new year, with many retailers optimistic about their prospects.","Retailers Bounce Back as Consumers Boost Spending

Despite recent concerns about a potential double-dip recession, the retail sector is showing signs of resilience. Department stores such as Macy's and Kohl's have reported strong quarterly results, with sales rising 7.3% and profit margins improving.

Macy's, in particular, has seen its business improve significantly, with jewelry, watches, and accessories proving to be top-performing categories. The company's CEO, Terry Lundgren, attributes the success to a combination of factors, including reduced inventory levels and new marketing initiatives.

The trend is not unique to department stores. Specialty retailers such as Baby Bunting have also reported strong sales growth, with online sales accounting for an increasing proportion of their business.

Economists are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for consumer spending in the coming months. The Commerce Department's report on sales has reinforced expectations of modest growth, while a gauge of consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2000.

The shift towards SUVs is also having an impact on the retail sector, with automakers such as Toyota and Ford debuting new models at the Los Angeles Auto Show. This trend is expected to continue, with Americans buying more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year.

As consumers continue to boost spending, retailers are taking note of changing consumer behavior. The importance of online sales is growing, while traditional marketing strategies are being re-evaluated. With interest rates on the horizon and a potential shift in economic policy, one thing is clear: the retail sector is ready for whatever comes next.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

an obituary for the american middle class headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! it’s the elephant in the room no one wants to talk about… the middle class in the u.s. economy is on the verge of collapse. yes, i said collapse. that social class that once helped the u.s. economy grow and prosper is coming apart. will the u.s. economy ever be the same without it or is this the new norm? here’s why it’s important to you. the middle class helped the u.s. economy (following world war ii and up until the credit crisis of 2008) by buying goods and services they needed or wanted. they bought cars, tv sets, furniture, appliances, clothing, computers, and flashy gadgets. in simple terms: they spent money. the spending by the middle class resulted in american companies selling more, making more, and hiring more people to meet consumer demand. businesses then took their profits and invested in new projects and built more factories. this is how cities like detroit flourished. but where does the middle class of the u.s. economy stand now? signs of trouble for the middle class of the u.s. economy actually started to surface at the start of the new century, but it wasn’t until the financial crisis when the middle class in the u.s. economy really started to deteriorate. today, the middle class is not buying or spending like it once did—and this is not by

recall all of the “expert” predictions about how president donald trump would be terrible for the u.s. economy. also recall how many of those same “experts” have been direly predicting the end of the retail sector of the economy for the past few years. well, all of the experts have thus far been proven wrong, as the economy is booming under trump’s guidance, and this christmas shopping season has sparked a resurgence among the retail sector, with sales that haven’t been seen in years, according to reuters. mastercard inc. announced on tuesday that, due to increased consumer confidence, lower unemployment figures and early discounts at retailers, american shoppers spent an estimated $$800 billion during this holiday season. that figure, which combines online and in-store purchases via credit cards and estimated cash payments from nov. 1 through dec. 24 — excluding automobile sales — was 4.9 percent higher than last year, the highest yearly increase since 2011. a significant chunk of that growth came from online retail sales, which grew by 18.1 percent, “but that’s probably only 11 or 12 percent of total retail sales … the bulk of sales still is very much in stores,” explained sarah quinlan, head of market insights for mastercard advisors. indeed, a news release from amazon noted that this was the company’s biggest holiday shopping season ever, as purchases from around the globe exceeded record levels. amazon reported more than one billion items sold

Article 6 - don’t discount the american shopper
don’t discount the american shopper (before it's news) on thursday morning, retailers reported better than expected monthly sales data as shoppers returned in force. clearly these results were cast against extremely weak sales data from a year ago, but the expectations had already baked in an improvement from these low levels. a year ago, the us economy looked fragile and on the edge of depression and consumer spent 5% less at these retailers. so, overall sales would need to increase by about 5.25% from a year ago just to get back to even, and analysts were anticipating a little better than that with 6.3% being the consensus. the actual results far exceeded expectations though coming in 9.1% better than a year ago. among the 20 retailers we cover that posted results this morning, 18 of them came in better than expected. an early easter in combination with warmer weather and rising consumer confidence all helped bring in double digit sales increases at target (tgt), macy’s (m), nordstrom (jwm), the gap (gps), costco (cost), and even a few more. after the fed’s most recent report showing a major contraction in consumer credit availability last month, some had feared that the revival of the consumer was already in trouble. however, results out of most retailers were overwhelmingly positive, as they posted their 4th consecutive monthly gains. while we are pleased to see the positive results from retailers, one must wonder how sustainable are

Article 1 - macy&#8217;s and polo ralph lauren deliver strong quarterly results
with the stock market’s gains for the year more than wiped out in recent trading, one might expect to see shoppers hunkering down for a double-dip recession by sticking to essentials like cotton socks or t-shirts. instead, macy’s strongest-performing categories were jewelry, watches, accessories like handbags, cosmetics and fragrances, along with men’s clothes and home, said karen m. hoguet, chief financial officer of macy’s, in a call with investors. she also noted that with stylish items, customers were not particularly price-sensitive, and that macy’s had been selling more items at their original prices, rather than having to mark them down. photo macy’s profit in the second quarter rose 64 percent to $241 million, or $0.55 a share, above analyst expectations of $0.50 a share. its sales rose 7.3 percent to $5.94 billion. “our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business, as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment,” ms. hoguet said. the “biggest surprise” in the macy’s results was its improved projections for the full year, said a citi analyst, deborah weinswig, in a note to clients. macy’s had begun the year saying full-year earnings should be $2.25 to $2.30 a share, then raised that to $2.40 to $

Article 2 - department stores staged a comeback in june
the results, though hardly dismal, unnerved industry executives, who are worried that higher gasoline prices may be crimping consumer spending. retail sales have been sluggish in three of the last five months, increasing pressure on retailers to generate strong results in the back-to-school shopping period later this summer, said ken perkins, a research analyst at retail metrics. ""we will be watching the next few months pretty closely,"" he said. to a certain degree, june fell victim to the success of june 2005, when sales rose 5.2 percent, the strongest monthly performance of last year. the numbers for june were also damped by wal-mart, the nation's largest retailer, which alone accounts for 10 percent of all united states retail sales excluding automobiles. sales at the discount chain increased just 1.2 percent, missing analysts' forecasts of a 2.2 percent gain. the company's chief financial officer, thomas m. schoewe, said wal-mart customers appeared to shop less frequently in june, indicating that gas prices are shaping their buying patterns. the specialty clothing industry produced several surprise disappointments. chico's and the limited missed their sales forecasts for the month, and so did abercrombie & fitch, which has been on fire for the last year. the company, which mainly sells apparel to teenagers and young adults, and also operates the hollister and ruehl chains, said its sales were off by 4

us business inventories up 0.1 percent in september by martin crutsinger, ap economics writer washington  nov 15, 2016, 10:19 am et 0 shares email u.s. businesses boosted their stockpiles by a slight amount in september while their sales increased by the most in three months. the commerce department says business inventories edged up 0.1 percent in september, slower than the 0.2 percent gain seen in august. sales were up a solid 0.7 percent, double the 0.3 percent rise in august. it was the best showing since a 1 percent gain in june. the gain in sales was evidence that the economy is gaining strength after a sluggish period at the beginning of the year. overall economic growth , as measured by the gross domestic product, increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the july-september quarter, double the 1.4 percent gdp gain in the second quarter. economists expect solid growth this quarter. a separate report tuesday showed that retail sales increased 0.8 percent in october following an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in september. both increases suggested that economic growth could accelerate more in the final three months of the year. the inventory report showed that stockpiles held by retailers rose 0.2 percent in september while inventories at the wholesale level edged up 0.1 percent and stockpiles held by manufacturers

Article 5 - retail stock rally leaves few bargains for investors
by noel randewich san francisco (reuters) - wall street expects consumers to open their wallets a little wider this holiday shopping season but bargains among red-hot retail stocks could be hard to find, especially as profit growth proves elusive for many big names. retailers, including best buy, kohls corp and macy's, that were pummeled in last year's disappointing holiday quarter have seen their shares surge recently on expectations that the worst is over, and that an improved economy will send more shoppers into their stores. those gains in recent days have helped push the s&p 500 to a record high. with u.s. consumers bolstered by wage gains and higher employment, holiday sales will grow 3.6 percent, national retail federation predicts. last year's growth was a modest 3.2 percent, short of the federation's 3.7-percent growth forecast. but some investors believe a healthy holiday shopping season and higher sales are already built into share prices, with some surging in the past few weeks. in november alone, shares of best buy and macy's have each jumped more than 20 percent, while kohls' stock is having its best month in more than 16 years with a 25 percent rise.

baby bunting reaffirms fy17 forecast aap – 55 minutes ago print australia's largest speciality infant goods retailer baby bunting has lifted store sales more than usual, is on track to open four new stores and expects to realise its full-year underlying earnings target. chief executive matt spencer has told shareholders at the group's annual general meeting on monday that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation is still expected to be in the range of $21.5 million to $24.5 million for 2016/17. mr spencer said sales in the year to november 13 had risen 20.3 per cent compared to the same period a year ago and that comparable store sales, which strips out new store openings, had risen 10 per cent. ""this is above our historical comparable store sales growth performance,"" he said. ""we do expect comparable store sales growth to moderate as the year progresses to be more in line with our historical average (of mid-single digit growth)."" this was because the group was cycling off exceptionally strong comparable sales recorded in the second half of the 2016, he said. shares in baby bunting have rallied on the back of the trading update and were up nine cents, or 3.27 per cent, at $2.84 at 1120 aedt. baby bunting continues to grow its online sales which now account for 5.7 per cent of its sales in the year to date, up from 

Article 7 - macy's says clothing sales strong, gives better outlook
new york — macy's raised its sales outlook for the year after it said business improved in the third quarter, and cited stronger clothing sales that spanned the men's, women's and children's sections. the department store chain also said it struck a deal with a real-estate investor that involves redeveloping some properties. that sent its shares up nearly 7 per cent thursday. still, the company's third-quarter earnings missed wall street expectations and a key revenue measure fell for a seventh straight quarter. macy's had been a stellar performer after the recession but has seen sales growth slow in the past year and a half as it and other traditional department store chains face competition from online and off-price rivals. kohl's shares also rose thursday as the company reported better-than-expected profit as it controlled its inventory — but sales fell. j.c. penney is set to report quarterly results on friday. macy's ceo terry lundgren, who is stepping down early next year, told the associated press that business was helped by the chain carrying less inventory but also by new ways to attract shoppers, like areas featuring ""smart watches."" the company launched an apple shop last month at its flagship new york store in herald square, making it the first u.s. department store with a hub devoted to the brand. beyond the apple shop, it's highlighting consumer tech at 180 stores, rolling out a display of smart watches. macy's has also launched its own

Article 8 - march survey of consumers is brighter
additional economic data, including employment figures for march, are expected to be a factor in determining when, or if, the fed will make a move. ''no matter how much importance mr. greenspan puts on the confidence data, both the equity and the bond market are probably overreacting'' to the new figures, said bruce steinberg, chief economist at merrill lynch & company. in its monthly report, which covered the first three weeks of march, the conference board said its consumer confidence index rose to 117.0 from 109.2 in february. it was the first increase since september. the conference board's monthly survey is based on a representative sample of 5,000 households across the country and is considered an important indicator because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. the confidence index reached an all-time high of 144.7 in january 2000. it reached that level again in may last year. given the generally gloomy news that has been released so far this month, most economists had expected the index to post a decline. consumer attitudes about the present situation were little changed from a month ago, but expectations about what the economy would look like in six months were much brighter. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and

Article 9 - strong sales at retailers raise hopes for growth
the commerce department’s report on sales brought relief to business owners, who had feared consumers would rein in spending this year as the unemployment rate crept above 10 percent and the recovery showed signs of weakness. the data reinforced the expectation of modest growth in consumer spending over the next several months, economists said, though retail sales alone would probably not increase fast enough to lift the economy out of its downturn. a gauge of consumer confidence added to hopes of a revival in spending. the university of michigan’s index registered its first increase in three months and outpaced expectations. the consumer sentiment index reached 73.4 in early december, an increase of 6 points, as americans appeared reassured by the slowing pace of job losses and encouraged by deep discounts from retailers. “the momentum here is positive,” said james f. o’sullivan, chief economist for mf global. “we’re seeing that better spending leads to a better job market which leads to better spending, in stark contrast to the downward spiral we were seeing a year ago.” in 2008, the picture of consumer spending was far dimmer: sales took a steep plunge toward the end of the year, dipping below $340 billion a month, as the financial crisis reached its peak. while sales reached $352.1 billion last month, that remained well below the $380 billion monthly sales figures of 2007. spending by consumers makes up more than two-thirds of the economy, and some analysts say a true recovery will not

Content: macy’s decent sales ride so far – analyst blog % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) amidst an uneven economic recovery, macy’s inc. (m) has been able to maintain a decent sales run so far in 2012, and we believe it will carry the same momentum over the year. the company has been relentlessly endeavoring to keep itself on the growth trajectory, while keeping an upbeat note in an economy that still lacks luster. riding on positive comps during a period from january to may 2012, macy’s has consistently registered comparable-store sales growth. in that period, comps growth touched a low of 1.2% and hit a high of 7.3%, thereby recording an average growth of approximately 3.9%. in the first five months of 2012, comps increased 2.4% in january, 4.6% in february, 7.3% in march, 1.2% in april and 4.2% in may. april sales were anticipated to be softer on account of the shift in easter and the cosmetic event to march this year from april in the prior year. moreover, the timing of mother’s day in the latter part of may also proved unfavorable for april sales. given the soft economic retrieval, monthly sales data for macy’s also portrayed a decent performance. the company, in the span of january to may 2012, registered a minimum sales growth of 0.4% and a maximum growth of 6.9%, reflecting an average growth of approximately 3.8% for the period. in the first five months, sales growth was 2% in january, 5.5% in february, 6.9% in march, 0.4% in april and 4.1% in may. let’s conclude macy’s department stores sell a wide range of merchandise. its products include men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods. in an attempt to increase sales, profitability and cash flow, the company has been taking steps such as integration of operations, consolidation of divisions, customer-centric localization initiatives, as well as developing e-commerce business and online order fulfillment centers. moreover, macy’s continues to focus on price optimization, inventory management and merchandise planning to drive traffic. however, the company’s customers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels and high household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary spending, and in turn the company’s growth and profitability. macy’s, which competes with j. c. penney company inc.

US Retail Sees Resurgence in Holiday Season

The US retail sector has seen a significant resurgence in the holiday season, with sales exceeding expectations. According to recent reports, American shoppers spent an estimated $800 billion during this period, a 4.9% increase from last year.

Retailers such as Macy's and Target reported double-digit sales increases, driven by warmer weather and rising consumer confidence. Online retail sales also saw significant growth, with Amazon reporting its biggest holiday shopping season ever.

The resurgence in retail sales is a welcome surprise for the industry, which had been struggling in recent years. The National Retail Federation had predicted a 3.9% increase in November and December sales, but many retailers exceeded expectations.

The strong performance of US retailers has also been driven by consumer confidence, with lower unemployment figures and early discounts at stores contributing to the surge in spending. The middle class, which had been struggling in recent years, appears to be showing signs of reengagement, with consumers buying goods and services they needed or wanted.

Overall, the holiday season has seen a significant boost for US retailers, with many reporting strong sales and increased consumer confidence. This trend is expected to continue into the new year, with many retailers optimistic about their prospects.

Retailers Bounce Back as Consumers Boost Spending

Despite recent concerns about a potential double-dip recession, the retail sector is showing signs of resilience. Department stores such as Macy's and Kohl's have reported strong quarterly results, with sales rising 7.3% and profit margins improving.

Macy's, in particular, has seen its business improve significantly, with jewelry, watches, and accessories proving to be top-performing categories. The company's CEO, Terry Lundgren, attributes the success to a combination of factors, including reduced inventory levels and new marketing initiatives.

The trend is not unique to department stores. Specialty retailers such as Baby Bunting have also reported strong sales growth, with online sales accounting for an increasing proportion of their business.

Economists are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for consumer spending in the coming months. The Commerce Department's report on sales has reinforced expectations of modest growth, while a gauge of consumer confidence has reached its highest level since 2000.

The shift towards SUVs is also having an impact on the retail sector, with automakers such as Toyota and Ford debuting new models at the Los Angeles Auto Show. This trend is expected to continue, with Americans buying more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year.

As consumers continue to boost spending, retailers are taking note of changing consumer behavior. The importance of online sales is growing, while traditional marketing strategies are being re-evaluated. With interest rates on the horizon and a potential shift

It also shares a similar style and content, focusing on the challenges faced by workers who become disabled or retire early. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE presents a more sensationalized view of social security and medicare, without providing specific data or research to support its claims. The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, provides a balanced analysis of the issue, citing recent data and expert opinions.","A Growing Concern: The Future of Retirement Security

As the baby boomer generation approaches retirement, a pressing concern is emerging about the sustainability of social security and medicare. Critics argue that these programs are unsustainable due to mounting unfunded liabilities and increasing contribution requirements.

The issue is not just about the financial burden on taxpayers, but also about the impact on younger generations who will be expected to foot the bill. A recent study found that a system of private investment would provide significantly higher rates of return than the current social security system.

Moreover, the rising cost of healthcare and the increasing age of retirement are putting pressure on pension systems. Some states are already instituting requirements for new employees to work longer before being able to retire with full pensions.

The conventional view that boomers will retire on their generational wealth is also being challenged. The reality is that many boomers will not have enough savings to support themselves in retirement, and the burden will fall on younger generations.

As policymakers consider reforms to social security and medicare, it's essential to prioritize the needs of employees and the long-term sustainability of these programs. A balanced approach that takes into account both financial stability and employee well-being is necessary to ensure a secure retirement for all Americans.","The Unseen Burden of Disability and Aging

As the workforce ages, a growing number of workers are facing unexpected challenges. According to recent data, nearly one-third of 20-year-old workers will become disabled before reaching retirement age at 67. The primary cause of disability is chronic disease, with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal problems, and cancer being leading diagnoses.

For those who become disabled, the financial implications can be severe. Without adequate insurance coverage, expenses can soar, especially if homes need to be altered to accommodate a disability. In some cases, individuals may find themselves facing significant out-of-pocket costs for medical bills and other expenses not covered by health insurance.

The issue of aging is also becoming increasingly pressing. The number of adults 50 and over is expected to reach 132 million by 2030, with one in five citizens projected to be 65 or older. This demographic shift is creating a growing demand for affordable housing that is accessible to people with age-related infirmities.

Furthermore, the financial burden of aging is not limited to individuals. Governments are facing significant challenges in providing adequate support for retirees, with many struggling to balance their budgets and address the rising costs of healthcare and other expenses.

As the population ages, it is essential that policymakers prioritize the needs of older workers and retirees. This includes extending retirement age, balancing budgets, and ensuring access to affordable housing and healthcare. By taking proactive steps to address these challenges, we can help mitigate the financial burden of aging and ensure that all individuals have the support they need to thrive in their golden years.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - when will the young wake up?
when will the young wake up? (before it's news) the younger people in america (and this likely goes for many parts of the world) are getting ripped off. they are being taken advantage of by the older people. older people know how to vote and influence their so-called representatives in congress. this isn’t to say that older people aren’t getting ripped off by the government too. but as far as wealth being redistributed, after the government and the lobbyists, the older generation is next in line for the plunder. it is hard to define the specific age groups. certainly anyone under 40 is getting ripped off. i would venture to say that anyone under 50 is too. somebody who is 50 years old right now is probably not going to see social security and medicare until at least the age of 70, and i even find that doubtful. there is nothing in the social security trust fund except ious. it is part of the national debt. even if those ious were good, there would still be a massive shortfall. and then there is the other, even more massive unfunded liability, called medicare. there is no possible way that the program can be sustained anywhere close to its current form. working people have to pay taxes to fund wars, pay foreign dictators, provide subsidies to rich farmers, fund all of the bureaucrats who make their lives more difficult, and then pay for the retirement of tens of millions of people on top of it. meanwhile, all

Article 2 - close antiquated illinois developmental centers to save money: letter to the editor
(before it's news) may 14, 2015 the arc of illinois congratulates gov. bruce rauner’s decision to do the right thing and restore important state grants to disability services, including the autism program and the arc’s illinois life span program. the life span program, known as the “411″ of disability services, has been in existence to families for over 14 years. last year we assisted more than 15,000 requests from families seeking advocacy and information resources. the disability system in illinois is extremely institutionalized and costly. illinois spends $$428 million a year segregating 1,730 individuals in seven fully operational state developmental centers. that works out to about $$250,000 per year per person. the arc is calling for the closure of six of the seven developmental centers. it is time to reinvest into our community system to support infants, children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, allowing them to keep their families intact and, as they age, supporting them to remain close to family and friends. there is waste in the disability system, but it is not in community services. we call upon rauner to continue to do the right thing for people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities, as well as for illinois taxpayers. he should close those six antiquated state institutions. everyone can live a rich and fulfilling life in the community with proper supports. tony paulauski frankfort the writer is executive director of the arc of illinois

Article 3 - pension reform should consider employee needs, workforce objectives
pension reform should consider employee needs, workforce objectives (before it's news) the efforts to reform state and local pension plans have followed a rather predictable path. mounting unfunded liabilities and always increasing contribution requirements create the ever-growing need for additional funding, which usually has the effect of slowly crowding out the delivery of public services. taxes may then be increased and/or municipal bonds issued. new—and lower—benefit tiers are added for new hires, and, because of the increasing pension debt, contribution rates still increase for employers and employees, even those in lower benefit tiers. what’s missing from this entire progression is any thought of what is best for employees in the long run and how plan design meets employer workplace goals. over the last decade, many of the changes that defined benefit plans adopted have not produced the necessary financial gains and solvency outcomes desired. only after these tweaks to use lower benefit tiers have come up short are fundamental changes to funding policy and benefit design for new hires typically considered. the starting position for many considering pension reform is that the traditional defined benefit (db) pension is the best type of plan for public workers as it provides lifelong income in retirement. but the need for change, the argument goes, will reluctantly have to override the ability to maintain this main feature. this attitude suggests an unfortunate tendency for policymakers to assume that in order to bring financial stability to the retirement system—employees —especially new hires, will have to settle for sub-optimal retirement outcomes. in reality,

Article 4 - retirement accounts next?” with graham mehl
retirement accounts next?” with graham mehl (before it's news) my two cents by andy sutton one of the biggest concerns of savvy investors since the ongoing crisis began in 2008 has been the safety and longevity of the various types of retirement accounts and systems. throwing gasoline on the flames have been the decisions rendered by courts of ‘law’ regarding the treatment of customer money in the case of the bankruptcy of several brokerage firms, most notably, mfglobal. the susceptibility of bank deposits has already been firmly established in prior issues of this column. to our alarm and dismay it appears, at least on the surface, as though few are doing anything to prepare for such an eventuality. our hope in authoring this collaborative piece is that it will cause more people to assess matters as circumstances pertain to them, and then take proper evasive action. if you still believe in the system and that it exists for your benefit and protection then you may stop reading now. the bail-in concept actually began to be implemented here in the united states before anywhere else. when a federal appellate court gave its stamp of approval in the sentinel case, it gave the green light to the theft of customer funds whether they be segregated in a brokerage account (but held in street name) or held as deposits in a traditional banking arrangement. the quiet and subtle change in status from depositors to unsecured creditors that took place back in 2010 has been well documented in this column. the fact that

Article 5 - still a better deal: private investment vs. social security
still a better deal: private investment vs. social security (before it's news) critics of private investment of social security taxes have long pointed to the supposed dangers of an unstable market as creating conditions too risky to allow workers personal choice in planning for retirement. indeed, the financial crisis is often used to bolster the argument that retirement funds are best left in the safe hands of the state, but how true is this claim?in a new cato study, “still a better deal: private investment vs. social security (http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=14088),” cato senior fellow michael tanner demonstrates that actual investment returns over the past 40 years show that a system of private investment will, in fact, provide significantly higher rates of return than the current social security system.please join us for a conversation with michael as he discusses this latest policy analysis and challenges the myth of the superiority of the social security safety net. read more at the cato event videos source:

(before it's news) the obama administration’s delphi debacle — when union members were made whole at the expense of non-union workers — continues to hound the white house. the free beacon looks at the scandal: fred arndt and his brother dave came to general motors straight out of high school. they spent their entire careers building the engine cooling systems that increase the lifespan of cadillacs and other vehicles. dave worked in assembly; fred, one year younger, qualified for gm university, which propelled him to work as a draftsman and engineer. they worked the line side-by-side. dave built the parts fred had designed. the brothers made their way to delphi, an auto supplier spun off from gm that builds components—seats, instrument panels, steering and suspension systems—for cars. after more than 30 years with the company, the brothers retired in their native michigan. they watched as delphi’s growing labor costs dragged it into chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. it would not emerge until 2009 when the government stepped in with $$50 billion for gm. and then the arndt brothers’ paths diverged. fred, 64, lost his health, dental, and life insurance, along with 70 percent of his pension. dave lost five percent of his health insurance and some dental coverage… …[fred] arndt is one of the more than 20,000 non-union delphi employees that have

7 chilling facts about retirement in america that should make obama tremble before cutting social security and medicare (before it's news) obama’s plan would be economically irresponsible, socially disruptive and morally repugnant. alternet april 7, 2013 | we are headed for a catastrophic retirement train wreck. a wall street-driven financial crisis has stripped millions of people of things like jobs, pensions and home equity that were supposed to deliver a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work. the crisis has also provided certain interests the opportunity to make false claims about the “unaffordability” of vital social insurance programs like social security and medicare that help the 99% make it. these opportunistic “ raiders of your lost retirement ” do not give a hoot if you starve in your golden years – this is about money to them. american financiers hate social security, for example, because they want to push us toward private retirement accounts on which they can charge fees. a large swath of the wealthy does not like social security and medicare because they do not like to pay taxes. you might think obama would be on the side of the citizens on this one. but it seems that the president will officially propose this week to cut social security and medicare as part of his annual budget, despite the fact that this move would be economically irresponsible, socially disruptive and morally repugnant. here are seven things that should make obama tremble before he dares

Article 8 - tlp: on the other hand, sometimes you can’t retire too soon
(before it's news) those government jobs just aren’t what they used to be. furloughs, ious and increased scrutiny of the cost of public employees. now, a growing number of state governments are instituting requirements that new employees work longer before being able to retire with full pensions. wsj: the change comes as foreign governments from france to morocco have either decided to increase or are contemplating a rise in the age at which private and public workers can receive government pensions. a federal commission studying long-term u.s. fiscal issues is also entertaining the idea of changing the retirement age as one way to shore up social security, said a person familiar with the matter. a report is due to president obama in december. individual states, meanwhile, are moving ahead as they respond to the widening gaps between the obligations made to workers and the money expected to be available to pay them, thanks to investment losses and recessionary budget pressures. “it’s a very positive change that the age for receiving full benefits is increasing,” said alicia munnell, director of the center for retirement research at boston college. “increasing the retirement age is the single most important thing [states] can do” to tame future pension costs, because it reduces the number of years the state is paying a benefit, she said. though lengthening lifespans have been expected to pressure pension systems, the looming fiscal predicament has emboldened lawmakers to demand more years from employees. also,

Article 9 - the happy story of boomers retiring on their generational wealth is wrong
the happy story of boomers retiring on their generational wealth is wrong (before it's news) this happy story is wrong on multiple counts. the conventional view of the baby boomers’ retirement is a happy story: since we’re living longer and remaining productive longer, boomers will not be as much of a burden on gen-x and gen-y as doom-and-gloomers assume. not only are boomers staying productive longer, they will draw upon their vast generational wealth as they age, limiting the financial burden on younger generations. this happy story is nicely summarized in this lengthy piece the fear factor: long-held predictions of economic chaos as baby boomers grow old are based on formulas that are just plain wrong. in this view, the only thing needed to prop up social security for the rest of the 21st century is a higher tax on high-income earners, in effect moving the limit on earned income exposed to social security taxes from about $$114,000 to $$217,000. this happy story is wrong on multiple counts. let’s start with the most egregious errors: 1. it ignores the end of work and the decline of full-time jobs 2. it ignores the elephants in the room, medicare and medicaid 3. it ignores the inconvenient reality that there is nobody to buy the boomers’ overpriced stocks, bonds and homes when they start to unload them put another way: the happy story ignores the changing nature of work and jobs, the unsustainable

Article 10 - when nobody is responsible for your retirement
when nobody is responsible for your retirement (before it's news) the law of unintended consequences is economics’ version of karma. it regularly clips politicians round the ears. but usually they’ve retired by the time it bites the true victims — you. paul keating’s superannuation system is today’s example. but it’s just generally true that the law of unintended consequences dominates public policy. case after case after case gradually convinced us.. governments cannot solve problems. they can make them worse. or they can create bigger problems. but governments never leave society with a net benefit. even if you ignore the bureaucracy it costs to implement them. if anything, politics has some entertainment value. and it creates highly predictable investment trends. neither are worth the money we pay in taxes. unfortunately, today’s topic doesnt entertain us. but it does leave you with a useful investment conclusion: don’t rely on your super for retirement. so our case in point when it comes to the law of unintended consequences is australia’s shambles of a retirement system. between super and the old age pension, politicians have removed any feeling of responsibility from the minds of many people to prepare for their own retirement. it also doesn’t work, which creates a dangerous combination. the very idea of retirement being some sort of right you don’t have to prepare for yourself is bizarre when you think it through. ‘politicians have got me covered’ isn’t the kind of mentality that has served the typical taxpayer anywhere else. unless you saved

Article 1 - disability, the insurance that is often sadly overlooked
about one-third of 20-year-old workers today will become disabled before they hit retirement age at 67, according to the social security administration. and the primary cause of disability is chronic disease — cardiovascular, musculoskeletal problems and cancer are leading diagnoses — rather than work-related mishaps or nonworkplace accidents, according to a 2007 study for the life and health insurance foundation for education, a nonprofit organization that informs the public about insurance needs. while job-related expenses decrease if someone cannot work, other expenses can soar, especially if homes must be altered to accommodate a disability, said craig sampson, a lawyer in richmond, va. he bought disability insurance in 1999 when he was self-employed. he pays about $800 a year for $30,000 in coverage. “being disabled, you can go down the financial tubes fairly quickly,” he said. “not only do you have regular living expenses you are unable to meet, but you have other expenses and all the uncovered medical bills. there’s a lot of stuff health insurance doesn’t cover.” tammy brown of bradford, ark., signed up for short-term and long-term disability insurance after she started working for wal-mart stores when she was 17. fifteen years later, in december 2004, when she was 32, she learned that she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or lou gehrig’s disease, and was told she had two to five years to live. she took the

Article 2 - the financial time bomb of longer lives
how are the most developed countries handling preparations for the boom in the elderly population — and for the budget-busting expenditures that are sure to follow? for a majority, not very well. unless governments enact sweeping changes to age-related public spending, sovereign debt could become unsustainable, rivaling levels seen during cataclysms like the great depression and world war ii, according to the s.& p. report. if the status quo continues, the report projects, the median government debt in the most advanced economies could soar to 329 percent of gross domestic product by 2050. by contrast, britain’s debt represented only 252 percent of g.d.p. in 1946, in the aftermath of world war ii, the report said. so what is to be done? for starters, governments should extend the retirement age, says marko mrsnik, the associate director of sovereign ratings in europe for s.& p. and the lead author of the report. another no-brainer, he says, is that governments should balance their budgets. alas, private citizens often don’t see the logic in curbing public benefits in order to maintain national solvency. witness france last week, where more than one million people took to the streets to protest pension reform that would raise the minimum legal retirement age to 62 from 60. moreover, global aging experts say, measures like pension reform are inadequate, piecemeal responses to the giant demographic shift that is upon us. if the cost of

Article 3 - federal panel warns bush of social security problems
improving service to the public should be a top priority for the new administration and congress, the panel said. ''the social security administration's capacity to serve the public is increasingly at risk'' because the agency's staff has shrunk while the volume and complexity of its work have greatly increased, the panel said. the number of social security employees has dropped 22 percent in the last 15 years, to 65,048, from 83,505 in 1985, the advisory panel said. but the number of beneficiaries in programs run by social security increased by 26 percent in those years, to 51.7 million, from 41.1 million. the shortage of staff has affected the agency's performance, causing ''delays in payment of benefits or payment of incorrect benefits,'' the advisory board said. the chairman of the advisory panel, stanford g. ross, who was commissioner of social security under president jimmy carter, said: ''unless there's fundamental change, we will soon see disruptions of service. the social security agency lacks the ability to handle existing workloads, and those workloads are bound to increase in the next decade.'' in an interview, mr. ross said: ''everybody knows there is a long-term deficit in the financing of social security. but there's also a deficit in the agency's ability to provide good service, and that should be equally alarming to congress and the public.'' the panel, created by a 1994

Article 4 - health benefits and retirees
a new federal regulation allows employers to reduce or eliminate health benefits for retirees when they turn 65 and become eligible for medicare. although that will cause distress for some, it is a welcome step that could help slow the deterioration of employment-based health insurance. it seems likely that the new rule will help far more people than it hurts. the regulation affects a relatively privileged minority of retirees — those who have company-provided health benefits. for companies that do provide retiree health benefits, there has been great uncertainty over whether they could provide broad coverage for those younger than 65 — those not eligible for medicare — while limiting or denying benefits to older retirees without violating age-discrimination laws. in late december, acting in accord with a favorable appeals court decision, the equal employment opportunity commission ruled that employers could drop coverage of older retirees or offer them plans that would supplement medicare or comparable state insurance programs while providing better benefits to younger retirees. the age-discrimination issues may still have to be adjudicated by the supreme court but as a matter of sound public policy the new regulation makes sense. the new rule is based on a plausible premise: if employers struggling with the rising costs of health care have to provide equal benefits, they will be more likely to eliminate all of their retiree coverage or reduce benefits to the younger retirees than to increase benefits to their medicare-eligible retirees. indeed, that has already happened in some public school districts in response to an earlier court decision and commission policy. advertisement continue reading

Article 5 - pension envy
if you work in the private sector and you've watched the health and pension benefits provided by your employer erode to where the phrase ''economic security'' is an oxymoron, maybe you are resentful that other workers have managed to maintain a decent level of benefits. those other workers, of course, work for the government. not only do they have better health and pension coverage than you do, but your tax dollars pick up the tab. no wonder people have pension envy. or, put another way, no wonder government workers are increasingly becoming scapegoats. what's been happening to worker benefits in the private sector is tragic, if not criminal (and sometimes it is both). but why hasn't it happened to anywhere near such an extent in the case of government workers? some say it is all due to the clout of public sector unions. they are stronger than private sector unions in many areas today, though not stronger than those unions once were. this argument holds that since government doesn't have to turn a profit and it has readily available funds from taxpayers, politicians prefer to meet union demands rather than face the workers' wrath at the polls. whatever the reasons, the reality is that in new jersey, and the rest of the nation, some hard-pressed workers feel the only way to improve their circumstances is at the expense of other workers. a fellow at the manhattan institute, a free-enterprise-loving policy organization in new york city, even put out a book fanning those flames

Article 6 - taking the wheel before a pension runs into trouble
a basic rule of thumb is that the government covers benefits of up to about $45,000 a year for people who retire at 65; this maximum rises each year with inflation. but the guideline can be misleading: it is a little like saying that your homeowner's policy pays a maximum of $450,000 before you know if it covers floods, fires, theft or other losses, or if possessions like antiques are handled in some other way. in reality, few people caught in a pension collapse happen to be 65 when their plan fails. for those who are younger, the maximum coverage is lower. for a 45-year-old whose plan fails this year, for example, the government covers a maximum of $11,403 a year, even if he has earned a larger pension. but for a 75-year-old, the government covers benefits of up to $138,665 a year. a list of the figures can be found at the web site of the pension agency, www.pbgc.gov/news/press--releases/2004/pr05--14.htm#chart. even these ceilings may be raised in some cases, thanks to a provision that shifts the remaining assets of a dying pension plan toward the oldest participants. congress designed the insurance that way on the assumption that the oldest people would be least able to re-enter the work force and start building a new nest egg. at us airways, for example, hundreds of older pilots qualified for this special provision. they

Article 7 - you’re probably going to need medicaid
photo imagine your mother needs to move into a nursing home. it’s going to cost her almost $100,000 a year. very few people have private insurance to cover this. your mother will most likely run out her savings until she qualifies for medicaid. this is not a rare event. roughly one in three people now turning 65 will require nursing home care at some point during his or her life. over three-quarters of long-stay nursing home residents will eventually be covered by medicaid. many american voters think medicaid is only for low-income adults and their children — for people who aren’t “like them.” but medicaid is not “somebody else’s” insurance. it is insurance for all of our mothers and fathers and, eventually, for ourselves. the american health care act that passed the house and is now being debated by the senate would reduce spending on medicaid by over $800 billion, the largest single reduction in a social insurance program in our nation’s history. the budget released by president trump last month would up the ante by slashing another $600 billion over 10 years from the program. whether the senate adopts cuts of quite this magnitude or not, any legislation that passes the republican congress is likely to include the largest cuts to the medicaid program since its inception. much focus has rightly been placed on the enormous damage this would do to lower-income families and youth. but what has been largely missing from public discussion is the radical implications that such cuts would have for older

Article 8 - want to retire early and hang a shingle? it'll cost you
""let's say somebody's 60 and has a dream to start their own business,"" ms. jareb said. ""would you rather have somebody like that out on their own, or have them sitting at the company twiddling their thumbs?"" the percentage of companies offering retiree health benefits has plummeted in the last decade, according to a recent report by the employee benefit research institute. from 1997 to 2002, the most recent year for which figures are available, the drop was especially steep, falling to 13 percent of companies from 22 percent. according to paul fronstin, the director of the institute's health research and education program, you are not likely to have retiree coverage unless you fall into one of three groups: high-level executive; union worker in a large manufacturing company; or civil servant. the only other way you are likely to have such coverage is if you have an insured spouse willing to keep working until you qualify for medicare, he said. retiree health care plays a major role in the choices older workers make, he said. ""there are people who have retiree health benefits from, say, a government job, and it allows them to take a job they wouldn't otherwise take,"" he said. ""not having it is a huge deterrent."" that is likely to be an unpleasant surprise to workers now heading toward 60, dr. fronstin added. surveys by the institute show that more than twice as many workers who are actually

Article 9 - u.s. insurer of pensions says its deficit has soared
the new investment policy is a ''recognition that stocks are not a hedge against long-term fixed liabilities,'' mr. bodie said. detailed information about individual plans is not disclosed by companies, but pension specialists say that about two-thirds of their assets are typically invested in stocks. this practice allows companies to post larger investment gains when the stock market is moving up, and accounting rules allow those gains to bolster the corporate bottom line. companies have so far resisted the argument that stocks are inappropriate investments for pension funds. but the recent bear market demonstrated that when stock prices fall, companies may be caught without enough money on hand to pay the pensions they owe. such shortfalls become critical when the company sponsoring the plan is itself in trouble and cannot generate enough cash to replenish the pension fund. at a briefing for journalists yesterday, mr. kandarian noted that the agency was less concerned about the strong, growing companies with underfunded pension plans than with companies whose pension funds are in bad shape and are unstable themselves. in recent months, administration officials have discussed ways of giving incentives to companies to operate their pension funds with less risk. ''should all companies be treated the same?'' mr. kandarian asked. ''one thing we've looked at very closely in the administration is whether the system should be more risk-based.'' he suggested that rewarding companies that handled their pension plans prudently would create a more equitable system. as things now stand, he said, companies that keep their pension plans healthy are

Article 10 - affordable housing for retirees
the population explosion among retirement-age americans that demographers have long predicted has arrived. the number of adults 50 and over is expected to reach 132 million by 2030, an increase from 2000 of more than 70 percent. by that time, one in five citizens will be 65 or older. this graying of the baby boomers is creating an urgent demand for affordable housing that is also accessible to people with age-related infirmities at a time when federal and state financing is falling far short of need. according to a new study by harvard university’s joint center for housing studies, governments at all levels are poorly prepared to meet the challenge. for various reasons, the next wave of retirees will be at greater risk of homelessness, hunger and other problems than their immediate predecessors. fewer of them will benefit from traditional pensions, which are disappearing. many lost their jobs during the recession and have exhausted their savings. and low-income homeowners who were counting on home equity to finance retirement lost nearly a third of their wealth. one-third of adults over 50, and just over one-third of those over 80, are “rent burdened” and paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing. this often means they have to cut back on essentials like food and medications. federal affordable-housing programs are already so badly underfinanced that only one in four low-income families qualifying for federal rent assistance actually gets it. to make matters worse, the study says,

Title: the disability insurance sideof social security raises some questions about plans to createpersonal accounts.
Content: this is no small problem. david autor, an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology, points out that one in eight people who start receiving social security retirement benefits each year are coming from the disability rolls. if disability benefits were continued at their current level after retirement age, a different problem would arise: disability would be more lucrative than retirement for workers who had poor investment returns on their personal accounts. the disability program already has difficulty in making consistent judgments as to whether workers are disabled -- in one study, one in six cases were judged differently by different state disability examiners -- so many marginally disabled workers who applied would probably be allowed benefits. older workers could flood into the disability program, weakening its already frail financial health. the second problem is that leaving disability insurance alone abdicates responsibility for fixing its financial difficulties, which are much more imminent than the retirement program's financial problems. according to a forecast by the social security trustees, the old age and survivors insurance trust fund will last until 2044, while the disability trust fund will be exhausted in 2029. integrating the disability program into a system of personal accounts is complicated because it is inherently an insurance program. disabled beneficiaries take out far more from the system than they put in. workers collectively insure the risk of disability. it is inconceivable that personal accounts could fulfill this role. moreover, only about a quarter of workers have employer-provided long-term disability insurance, so it is unlikely that the private sector could provide adequate insurance by itself. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the disability program poses a major obstacle to changes in social security because a large number of workers apply to and are accepted into the program; 17 percent of all social security recipients are on disability benefits. despite improvements in health and life expectancy, the number of workers and their dependents receiving disability benefits increased to 8 million in 2004 from 3.9 million in 1985 because of weak earning opportunities for low-skilled workers and more expansive coverage of disabilities, according to research by professor autor and mark duggan of the university of maryland. unfortunately, research by various economists suggests that transforming the disability program to encourage work and self-sufficiency the way that welfare was transformed may not be possible. susan chen of duke university and wilbert van der klaauw of the university of north carolina at chapel hill recently produced the latest study of the work behavior of those whose applications for disability insurance were rejected. they argue that rejected applicants have better health and work prospects than accepted applicants, and, therefore, their experiences provide an upper bound on how well disability beneficiaries

A Growing Concern: The Future of Retirement Security

As the baby boomer generation approaches retirement, a pressing concern is emerging about the sustainability of social security and medicare. Critics argue that these programs are unsustainable due to mounting unfunded liabilities and increasing contribution requirements.

The issue is not just about the financial burden on taxpayers, but also about the impact on younger generations who will be expected to foot the bill. A recent study found that a system of private investment would provide significantly higher rates of return than the current social security system.

Moreover, the rising cost of healthcare and the increasing age of retirement are putting pressure on pension systems. Some states are already instituting requirements for new employees to work longer before being able to retire with full pensions.

The conventional view that boomers will retire on their generational wealth is also being challenged. The reality is that many boomers will not have enough savings to support themselves in retirement, and the burden will fall on younger generations.

As policymakers consider reforms to social security and medicare, it's essential to prioritize the needs of employees and the long-term sustainability of these programs. A balanced approach that takes into account both financial stability and employee well-being is necessary to ensure a secure retirement for all Americans.

The Unseen Burden of Disability and Aging

As the workforce ages, a growing number of workers are facing unexpected challenges. According to recent data, nearly one-third of 20-year-old workers will become disabled before reaching retirement age at 67. The primary cause of disability is chronic disease, with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal problems, and cancer being leading diagnoses.

For those who become disabled, the financial implications can be severe. Without adequate insurance coverage, expenses can soar, especially if homes need to be altered to accommodate a disability. In some cases, individuals may find themselves facing significant out-of-pocket costs for medical bills and other expenses not covered by health insurance.

The issue of aging is also becoming increasingly pressing. The number of adults 50 and over is expected to reach 132 million by 2030, with one in five citizens projected to be 65 or older. This demographic shift is creating a growing demand for affordable housing that is accessible to people with age-related infirmities.

Furthermore, the financial burden of aging is not limited to individuals. Governments are facing significant challenges in providing adequate support for retirees, with many struggling to balance their budgets and address the rising costs of healthcare and other expenses.

As the population ages, it is essential that policymakers prioritize the needs of older workers and retirees. This includes extending retirement age, balancing budgets, and ensuring access to affordable housing and healthcare. By taking proactive steps to address these challenges, we can help mitigate the financial burden of aging and ensure that

In the world of combat sports, 2017 was a year to remember. The UFC schedule was packed with exciting matchups, including highly anticipated title defenses and intriguing newcomers looking to make a name for themselves.

One of the most highly anticipated fights of the year took place on September 9th at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Canada. Demetrious ""Mighty Mouse"" Johnson put his lightweight title on the line against massive underdog Ray Borg. Despite being a heavy favorite, Borg gave Johnson a run for his money, but ultimately fell short.

Meanwhile, in the world of boxing, two superstars were set to face off in a highly anticipated bout. Floyd Mayweather Jr., widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, was looking to take down Conor McGregor, the Irishman known for his flashy style and devastating left hand. However, it's worth noting that Mayweather has been reported to have offered McGregor $15 million to fight him.

In other news, UFC president Dana White recently made a surprise offer to both Mayweather and McGregor, reportedly aiming to stage a massive crossover event between the two sports. While this idea has sparked debate among fans, one thing is certain: these two fighters are set to put on a show for the ages.

As we look back on 2017, it's clear that this year was marked by thrilling fights, surprising upsets, and some of the biggest names in combat sports. With new matchups and rivalries emerging all the time, fans can't wait to see what the future holds for these incredible athletes.","Unbeaten Boxers Clash in Light-Heavyweight Showdown

In a highly anticipated battle, undefeated light-heavyweight champion Andre Ward took on Russian challenger Sergey Kovalev at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The fight was billed as a clash of styles, pitting Ward's slick boxing against Kovalev's powerful punching.

The early rounds saw Kovalev's aggressive style take its toll on Ward, with the Russian knocking him down in the second round and chasing him around the ring. However, Ward dug deep and managed to land some good punches of his own, earning him a narrow 10-9 round from the judges.

As the fight wore on, Ward found his range and landed several solid body shots, including a quick punch inside early in the fifth round. The crowd at the T-Mobile Arena roared its approval as the two fighters went after each other, neither giving an inch.

In the end, it was Ward's counter punching that proved decisive, earning him a unanimous decision victory over Kovalev. The Russian's aggressive style ultimately proved to be his downfall, as Ward's defensive skills and ring generalship allowed him to outmaneuver his opponent.

The win marked Ward's 31st professional victory, cementing his status as one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. For Kovalev, it was a tough loss, but he showed promise as a challenger, and many believe that this fight will be remembered as one of the greatest of all time.

The win also marked a significant moment for Ward, who had been looking to headline a pay-per-view card in Las Vegas.

Article 2 - a celebrating the life of muhammad ali semi-open weekend thread
a celebrating the life of muhammad ali semi-open weekend thread (before it's news) as is our habit and tradition, do consider this a semi-open weekend thread. muhammad ali passed away yesterday. i am no fan of hagiographies. i do not count many people as personal heroes. i also know that america celebrates great men and women of color who are radical freedom fighters and truth-tellers only when they are dead, dying, infirm, and/or many years after their passing. the muhammad ali i celebrate and honor was and is smart, witty, mean, mercurial, entrepreneurial, artistic, creative, a trickster, humane, a liar, complicated, afraid, womanizing, a narcissist, ego maniacal, and a warrior. does listing such traits constitute a hagiography? i am unsure. there is so much that has been written about muhammad ali. many of the books are excellent. i am particularly fond of king of the world, the fight, and the complete muhammad ali. slate has a nice list of some of the great essays and shorter reflections on “the greatest”. norman mailer’s “ego” contains this wonderful writing: muhammad ali begins with the most unsettling ego of all. having commanded the stage, he never pretends to step back and relinquish his place to other actors—like a six-foot parrot, he keeps screaming at you that he is the center of the stage. “come here and

world boxing champ models traditional masculinity (before it's news) meet tyson fury, 6 ft. 9, heavyweight champ of the world, gypsy king, and enemy of the new world order right after winning the heavyweight title, tyson fury, 27, challenged the pansies running the new world order. by thomas carter (henrymakow.com) for those who are not boxing fans you may not have had the pleasure of seeing this young man in action, and i don’t just mean in the boxing ring. tyson fury, who stands at 6′ 9″ was born in the uk into a band of gypsies known as the traveling irishmen. his father named him tyson after mike tyson in hopes that he would win the heavyweight crown someday which he did in remarkable fashion ten days ago when he beat wladimir klitschko who had reigned the heavyweight division for over a decade. who knew that young tyson fury, right after winning the heavyweight title, would pick a fight with the new world order. fury, fighting on klitschko’s home turf in germany, also managed to get his own way in two disputes over the match particulars despite klitschko’s reputation as a control freak who wants every advantage over his opponent on fight night. first, he managed to get the gloves he wanted and secondly on fight day, after threatening to drop out of the contest, he had thick pieces of

Article 4 - skip bayless: conor mcgregor would beat floyd mayweather
skip bayless is arguably one of the biggest trolls on the face of the planet. no one knows how to stir the pot quite like bayless. he unfairly criticizes lebron james 24/7. he somehow loves both the dallas cowboys and new england patriots and i don’t even know how that’s possible. most importantly, he still believes tim tebow can be an nfl starting quarterback. in a weird way, i almost respect his troll game at this point because he truly believes every word that comes out of his mouth. knowing all of this, i can’t believe i am going to say this, but i have crossed over to the dark side. i am going to agree with skip bayless on a sports topic. on his show undisputed, bayless was debating with shannon sharpe if conor mcgregor could beat floyd mayweather jr. in a boxing match. here is a short clip from the debate. it pains me to say this, but i agree with skip bayless. conor mcgregor could beat floyd mayweather jr. in a boxing match. i promise you that i am not trying to be a troll. after watching the irishman for the past three years, i am all in with mcgregor. time and time again, mcgregor has conquered every challenge he has faced. he talks the talk but also walks the walk. defeat josé aldo for ufc featherweight championship in 

Article 5 - holly holm v. anne-sophie mathis 2 — the reckoning
holly holm v. anne-sophie mathis 2 — the reckoning (before it's news) holly holm v. anne-sophie mathis ii — the reckoning much has been written about the oft described “stunning right” delivered by anne-sophie mathis (26-1, 22 kos) that ko’d holly holm (30-2-3, 9 kos) at 1:39 in the seventh round of their international boxing association (iba) and wban welterweight title fight. boxing writers dubbed mathis’ victory the upset of the year, though many pointed to mathis’ fifth round hit and subsequent 6th round shot that sent holm down to the canvas as having clearly rocked holm before she ever made it to the seventh round. holm was floored again, but got up before the final straight right that floored her and prompted the referee, rocky burke to stop the fight. anne-sophie mathis is a ko artist of the first order–and proved that over and over again in her victory over holm. what many have questioned is whether holm was prepared for the onslaught in the run up to their december battle–but more importantly, have questioned why both the ref and holm’s corner for let her continue after the 6th round when she was so clearly rocked. the two are set to meet again on june 15th in what is being

Article 6 - dana white just offered conor mcgregor and floyd mayweather a massive fortune to fight
they said it was the fight that would never happen but how could they turn this down? floyd mayweather is thought to be the greatest boxer of all-time. his style is similar to playing dodgeball with your fists. when he fought manny pacquiao, manny found himself swinging and missing repeatedly, punching into the air. conor mcgregor, on the other hand, has ruled combat sports like no athlete we have seen since muhammad ali. he draws huge crowds and record pay-per-views. people have wondered what would happen if these two superstars met? of course, the rules matter. with boxing rules, it is hard to imagine mcgregor defeating mayweather. on the other hand, mayweather is a specialist rather than a brawler, and one would think that a mma-stule fight would not go well for him. do you remember what happened when randy couture fought the world-class boxer james toney? it was not pretty for toney and the fight ended quickly. earlier, it was reported that mayweather offer to pay mcgregor $$15 million himself to fight him. no one knows if the offer was sincere or if it was simply hype. now, ufc president dana white has entered the discussion, and he has made the two athletes and offer that it seems would be difficult to refuse. in a recent appearance on “the herd” with colin cowherd, white declared that he wanted to “cut out

Article 7 - marcos maidana vs devon alexander
marcos maidana vs devon alexander (before it's news) written by jake wallwork alexander and maidana make their debuts at welterweight if the welterweight division isn’t already packed with superstars, and already considered as the best division in the game, now that devon alexander and marcos maidana will fight each other at 147 it certainly should be. floyd mayweather, manny pacquiao, andre berto, victor ortiz, kell brook, mike jones, dejan zaveck and now devon alexander and marcos maidana. just some of the top notch fighters which fight at boxing’s most popular weight class. what makes it more exciting is the fact that like the big boys at light welterweight; amir khan, timothy bradley, and lamont peterson all look like moving up to welterweight sometime in the near future. there are many potential match ups between the boxers i have just mentioned in the future. but right now we have devon alexander vs marcos maidana. a fight which promises to be more entertaining than devon alexander’s ‘fight’ with timothy bradley. no belt is on the line for this clash, but think of it as an unofficial title eliminator for a welterweight belt. where does the loser go from here? in my opinion the loser of this one is in a very bad position

Article 8 - 7 classic video game character battles [who ya got?]
ever since the original nintendo entertainment system made its u.s. debut in 1985, video game heroes have led people through cinematic sagas, breathtaking adventures and suspenseful action. as we rubbed our fingers raw on the (occasionally) indestructible controllers, icons such as mario, sonic, ryu, and donkey kong became indelible symbols in our minds for years to come. while we’ve become used to seeing the protagonists lead us towards victory, what happens when these unique worlds collide? and , more importantly, which of these worlds has the mightier hero? that’s why coed’s team of video game experts and data analysts have been working around the clock to predict who would come out on top in our list of 7 crossover battles between video game icons! vote for who you think will win! mario vs. sonic two of the most recognizable characters in video game history would make for an ideal match-up, testing their speed and strength in a brightly colored world of loops and obstacles. while mario is equipped with a closet full of powerful suits, sonic’s insane speed and ability to roll through a level in mere seconds might be a bit too hot for the overall-wearing plumber to handle. perhaps the world-famous italian might be able to stun the hedgehog with a well-timed jump, but it seems like sonic would be running circles around him within the blink of an eye. my pick: sonic marcus fenix (gears of

Article 9 - bernard hopkins vs chad dawson: the rematch
bernard hopkins vs chad dawson: the rematch (before it's news) written by jake wallwork one of the biggest let downs of 2011 gets a rematch bernard hopkins vs chad dawson was one of the more anticipated bouts of last year. however due to an early injury (hopkins shoulder in the 2nd round) the fight turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments of 2011. due to this disappointment there was no public demand for the fight to be remade. but to my surprise, the rematch was made rather easily. the fight will take place on the 28th of april at the boardwalk hall, atlantic city, new jersey, united states. for the uk fans the fight will be shown on boxnation just as the first fight was. and hbo will show the fight in america. seth mitchell will be fighting on the undercard, opponent to be announced. i’m surprised bhop took the fight because hopkins is 47, i’m surprised that he is taking a fight where there is a big possibility of him loosing. i thought he would have campaigned for a fight where he has a much better chance of winning, someone like nathan cleverly or beibut shumenov – who are also belt holders. also if you look at the fight he had with dawson, from what we saw, dawson was setting the pace and doing enough

Article 10 - ufc: henderson defeats melendez, proposes to girlfriend
ufc: henderson defeats melendez, proposes to girlfriend % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) on saturday, benson henderson took on gilbert melendez at the hp pavilion in san jose for ufc on fox 7. henderson and melendez went five rounds, with the former winning three and keeping his ufc lightweight title (155lb). to many, a number of rounds were extremely close so when it went to the judges there was not a clear winner. however, when henderson was announced the winner the crowd at the hp pavilion began booing, likely because melendez is somewhat of a hometown hero. henderson’s record now sits at 19-2 mma, 7-0 ufc with melendez at 21-3 mma, 0-1 ufc. after the split decision, henderson added to his ufc win with a more personal win by dropping to one knee and asking his girlfriend, maria magana, to marry him. enthusiastically, magana said yes. with such a hotly contested fight there is likely a henderson-melendez rematch in the future. published in latino daily news source:

One of the most highly anticipated fights of the year took place on September 9th at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Canada.

As we navigate the complexities of modern life, it's easy to overlook the subtle yet significant challenges that many people face. A recent study on a zero-carb diet revealed that even with careful planning and execution, setbacks can occur. One individual experienced a bout of diarrhea after consuming high amounts of fat, highlighting the importance of monitoring one's body's response to new foods.

In other news, a high school student in Japan shared their personal struggle with acute leukemia, sparking concern among friends and family. The student's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking medical attention when symptoms persist or worsen over time.

For those who suffer from chronic conditions like asthma, everyday life can be a constant battle. A recent post discussed the challenges of managing bronchospasm, highlighting the need for self-care and awareness.

In the world of productivity, a writer reflected on the common misconception that ""time management problems"" are solely the result of poor planning. Instead, they argued that underlying issues such as strategy, priorities, and internal systems can have a more significant impact on one's ability to manage time effectively.

Travelers often face unique challenges when exploring foreign countries. Dehydration is a common affliction, especially in tropical climates. Recognizing the early warning signs of dehydration – such as nausea, headaches, and dark urine – can help prevent this condition from becoming severe.

In the realm of personal growth, individuals may experience moments of ""guidance"" that offer insight into their lives. These physical sensations can serve as a reminder to prioritize self-care and listen to one's inner voice.

As we navigate our daily lives, it's essential to acknowledge the unseen struggles that many people face. By being more aware of these challenges and taking steps to address them, we can lead more fulfilling and productive lives.","Marathon Mania: The Unseen Toll on Runners' Bodies

Running a marathon is an incredible feat, but it's not just the physical endurance that comes into play. The human body undergoes significant changes during and after the event. Blood flow to the stomach decreases, leading to discomfort, while all muscle fibers are utilized to complete the 26.2-mile distance.

The digestive system also plays a crucial role in marathon running. Runners often avoid eating heavy meals before the race, as this can disrupt digestion. Additionally, carbohydrates stored in muscles deplete during the run, making mid-race snacks necessary for some runners.

However, not everyone is a seasoned runner. For those new to the sport, training can be just as taxing as the actual event. Long runs and intense workouts can affect daily life, causing colleagues to feel like they're in an endurance event themselves.

Elite marathoners still have much to learn about their bodies. Even world-class athletes need motivation and guidance to stay on track. For some, running is a passion that drives them forward, while others rely on group training and self-motivation to push through challenges.

But the risks of marathon running are very real. Two runners who completed the recent New York City Marathon have passed away due to heart-related issues. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of pre-existing medical conditions and the need for caution when pushing one's body to its limits.

Despite these risks, many runners continue to push themselves to new heights. For some, it's about personal achievement, while others do it to raise awareness for specific causes or diseases. Whatever the motivation, running a marathon is an incredible feat that requires dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to face the unseen toll on one's body.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

connor's zero carb diet journey day 73 (before it's news) zero carb chronicles retrieved from: http://zero-carb.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss yesterday i had a little setback. i had a bout with the runs a little after i ate my second meal of the day. i did not really cramp much at all. i think it was my large ingestion of fat. most of the meat i have been eating lately has been grilled. we all know that some of the fat for the most part on grilled meats drip away. the two meals i had yesterday had lots of great tasting fat. after my second trip to the restroom i laid down and fell asleep. i woke up last night just before midnight to go again to the restroom. it was almost gone at that point, but i was in no mood to fire up the laptop and write the post. i actually ended up waking up a little late this morning. i feel much better right now. i will continue eating the same meals as i did yesterday. my body will adjust to the fat intake. i just hope i don’t have a repeat of yesterday. work was uneventful for the most part. no movement on the scale yesterday. thank you for stopping by and sharing my zero carb experience with me. morning fast: water and coffee 1st meal: 12 oz brisket and water 2nd meal: 12 oz brisket, ice tea and water start weight:

prelude to an asthma flare (before it's news) n/a so my asthma is acting up again and i feel like i have the proverbial elephant sitting on my chest. i say my asthma is acting up, but in actuality it’s always acting up, so i guess what i really mean is that my symptoms have been ramping up from my norm, getting more intense. it’s more difficult to get air in than to get it out, which tells me that what im experiencing has more to do with bronchospasm than just air trapping. in any case, im absolutely miserable. it’s the old trying to breath through a narrow straw kinda feeling. i haven’t been able to sleep for several days and basically feel like crap. the trigger for this latest bout could certainly be weather related, as it’s been raining non-stop for a week and high humidity levels always sets me off. but who knows, just about anything can set me off. its much more than just a nag being short of breath like this, it totally sucks. rather than getting pissed off and adding fuel to the fire by becoming overly anxious by it, ive decided to write down my thoughts in this post. im writing this post ad-lib while sucking on a nebulizer, so please excuse any grammar mistakes or ramblings. it’s hard to stay focused when you can’t breath. ive actually been flaring for several days now, so im probably farther along into an exacerbation than i think.

Article 4 - the iceberg that sinks performance
the iceberg that sinks performance (before it's news) i’m back. the last few weeks have been hectic for me: i finished the manuscript for my book, a factory of one, and submitted it to productivity press, who will be publishing it in november or december this year. many thanks to all of you in the lean community who provided feedback, comments, stories, and challenges to my thinking along the way. i’ve also spent a long week clarifying my thinking about how lean concepts and tools tie into time management and individual performance. in the spirit of visual management, i thought that drawing this relationship would be helpful. this is what i came up with: obviously, i’m no rembrandt. but i think this iceberg does a pretty good job of expressing the actual situation that i’ve seen over the past few years when people complain that they’re overwhelmed, or that their group needs time management training, or that they simply don’t have enough time to do everything. their complaint — the visible symptom, the part of the iceberg above the water — is not the problem at all. it’s a symptom. the root cause — the real problem — lies below the waterline. and while it’s invisible, it can — and will — sink the ship. time management “problems” are really just manifestations of dysfunction in one or more of the following areas: strategy; priorities; internal systems and processes; corporate cultural expectations; or individual skills. and this is why very often time management

Article 8 - know the signs and avoid dehydration when travelling
know the signs and avoid dehydration when travelling (before it's news) there’s an often ignored malady that i suspect many of us have succumbed to when travelling, maybe without even realising it. it’s particularly easy to get struck down by this one, and it can really ruin at least a few days of your trip. i am of course talking about dehydration. i’ve met quite a few people on various travels who have been convinced they were suffering from all kinds of things, from the flu through to food poisoning. i also grew up on a small tropical island where visitors would often be struck down with this malady. i thought therefore that a post offering tips for noticing and avoiding this common traveller’s pitfall would be handy. we’ll start with: how to recognise the early warning signs of dehydration the weird thing about dehydration is that feeling thirsty is often not a symptom. i’m sure there’s an excellent reason for this, but usually when people have all the symptoms, and you suggest that dehydration might be an issue, they’ll say that they didn’t think of that because they weren’t thirsty. the human body – a constant medical marvel. here are three easy indicators to look out for, although they might not all be present: feeling nauseous headache dark urine basically, if you’re an adult, and have ever experienced a hangover, then you’re already a bit familiar with what dehydration feels like. other symptoms that dehydration can cause i think one of the main reasons that

kp message 5-18-15… “early morning guidance (i’m sure i’ve put my finger on it)” % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) there are various forms of “guidance” in my life. some are telepathic, some are via my “inner senses”, some take the form of “physical”. today i had a physical one. after returning to my car after the walk, i left and felt drawn to the ocean at old airport. i spent my time appropriately “immersed”, got out, and walked over the rocks to get back to car. at one rock, i could sense my body tipping, and i fell back a short distance, but my left hand and arm caught most of the (fairly light) impact. anyway, shortly after i was at target, getting a cup of ice to immerse my soon-to-swell fingers. bottom line, i am feeling a bit of pain (like after having a hyperextension of fingers (like a volleyball injury)), but likely i will not attend the council meeting tomorrow. that’s “guidance”, baby. the other part of this is that i realized that perhaps my “ocean entering” time at old airport may have passed. also, with my love of playing guitar, and my role as a blogging type person, i need to care for my hands and fingers. also, my primary purpose on this planet, at this phase

Article 1 - how running a marathon affects the body
from the start of the race to the finish, running a marathon can take a toll on even the most experienced runners. here's a look at how your body can be affected by running 26.2 miles. your body reroutes blood flow as a runner starts a race, the body immediately sends blood to the areas in use. ""the body is very smart it starts sending oxygen and blood to where it's most needed,"" said dr. dennis cardone, the chief of primary care sports medicine at the department of orthopedic surgery at nyu langone medical center in new york city. ""the blood flow to the stomach and gastrointestinal system starts to decrease and increasingly blood flow goes to working muscles."" as a result of decreased blood flow to the stomach, cardone advises runners to avoid eating anything that can disrupt the stomach. ""it's why we tell people don't have a big meal, don't have anti-inflammatory medication,"" cardone explained. discomfort ""can get more pronounced."" grandmother runs marathon to raise money for cancer runner overcomes seizures and brain surgery, returns to new york city marathon all of your muscles get a workout. all of them for the marathon distance, the body uses every single type of muscle fiber to help get through the race. this means using fast-twitch muscle fibers normally only used for sprinting. as a result of tapping into all this muscle fiber, carbohydrates stored in the muscle start to deplete, meaning a runner might need a mid-race snack

Article 2 - not my mother’s yoga
other moms dyed their hair perfect shades of red. they wore trendy clothing and drove little sports cars. they went to church on sunday and baked cookies for the bake sale. my best friend’s mom wore a bikini in the summer and drew all kinds of admiration from the girls in our school as well as the boys. i wanted to be their daughter, to have the kind of mother who would show me how to curl my bangs and how to hold the hair spray can so my hair didn’t turn into a frozen waterfall of crusty flakes. to be sure, my mom was a freak. but i also adored her. she smelled like roses and sandalwood and had soft hands that would stroke my face when i fought with a friend and hold me when i was sad. she listened to every annoying middle school saga and knew all of my friend’s dramas and remembered to ask all the right questions. she took me to her ashram (now the kripalu yoga center in stockbridge, mass.) multiple times during the weeks at a time she’d stay there. i’d choke down the vegetarian food and count the days until my father would come and pick us up, bringing me ice cream and normalcy. yoga was slow, much too slow for a skinny adolescent who loved running and jumping and sprinting and hurdling. my mother was never pushy about her practice. she stuck to it and encouraged me to try, but she didn’t force it on the rest of us

Article 3 - running for my life
putting on a mask and gloves to protect myself from germs, i dragged my iv pole up and down the pike, stopping to do runner's stretches. my walks on the pike gave shape to my days and distracted me from pain and anxiety. fear of death was in the back of my mind, but i had more immediate challenges -- 105-degree fevers, vomiting, shakes, diarrhea, head-to-toe rashes and sores in my mouth and throat so severe that i sometimes couldn't eat. i cried and considered staying in bed, curled up under the quilt i had brought from home. but i knew that if i could get out, i'd feel energized for 30 minutes or maybe even an hour. putting one foot in front of the other, i felt encouraged accomplishing small goals in the face of uncertainty about the more elusive goal of beating the disease. i put on a pair of earrings, mimicking preparation for a normal day. i also rode an exercise bicycle in my room for about 15 minutes a day. when i was too sick to leave the ward, the nurses helped me calculate that 44 lengths along the nurses' station was a mile and let me walk it using bags of saline solution as weights. my hair fell out, grew back and fell out again. once when i was at home between treatments, i fainted into my mother's arms and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. i had developed a dangerous pneumonia that required lung

Article 4 - for new york winners, a hectic pace after the race
""i was so tired,"" she said, ""that i don't know the name of the restaurant, and i had fish and i don't know what kind. we got back to the room at 10:30 and i went to sleep. i was up at 6 in the morning because my body is on latvian time and it was 3 in the afternoon in latvia."" yesterday morning, prokopcuka and tergat rang the opening bell at the new york stock exchange. then came another news conference, countless television interviews for american and european outlets and a taping of the ""late show with david letterman."" tergat, the world-record holder in the marathon, followed most of that schedule. his postrace dinner party of 12 included his wife, monica, and his coach, gabriele rosa of italy. they went to an italian restaurant, where tergat indulged in pasta. he was in bed by 10 o'clock, but he said he could not sleep. yesterday, wearing a black suit, white shirt with french cuffs and a red tie, tergat looked as if he had just finished a board meeting rather than a foot race. he said the race, in which he beat the defending champion, hendrick ramaala of south africa, in the closest finish in new york history, was ""a painful experience."" ""but i love my sport,"" he said. ""i will probably run three more

Article 5 - running on fumes in beijing
“i’m going in there optimistic,” she said. “how bad can it be?” still, it gives me pause that the united states’ track and marathon athletes are not arriving in beijing until the last minute. they’re training in dalian, a comparatively pollution-free city north of beijing, where they can get accustomed to the time zone and heat. they won’t even try to be out there breathing the beijing air every day while sweating in the intense heat and humidity. and it is hard to dismiss the cautionary tales. tom fleming, who won the new york marathon in 1973 and 1975, is an experienced runner and coach. he was in beijing twice, in 1991 and 1994, both times as coach for the united states women’s ekiden team. in ekiden, a relay race popular in asia, runners cover various distances to equal a marathon distance of 26.2 miles. the ekiden races were in march, so heat and humidity were not severe, tom said, but the pollution had him worried. “what i noticed was that my white shirt was gray,” he said. “that’s when i said, ‘holy crow.’ you know it can’t be good. “let me know if you see any chinese people running,” he added. “i never saw anyone.” that’s because ordinary beijing residents almost never run on the streets where tom was running. running, it turns out, is

Article 6 - terminally ill man takes on marathon towing oxygen tank to raise awareness for pulmonary fibrosis
a terminally ill man took on the daunting task of finishing a marathon on sunday to draw attention to the disease that is killing him: pulmonary fibrosis . evans wilson, 63, finished the seattle marathon in 10 hours and 55 minutes yesterday, walking the entire thing with his oxygen tank in tow and coming in under his goal time of 14 hours but lagging a bit behind winner kota reichert, who won in 2 hours and 33 minutes. as he recovered from the ordeal today, wilson said he wasn't in too much pain. ""i'm in pretty good shape if i didn't have heart and lung disease,"" wilson told abc news. a former runner, wilson decided to return to races after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis when he was 57. the disease refers to a scarring of the lungs and can have many causes, including genetic, particle exposure and autoimmune diseases. wilson said it took two years for doctors to give him a clear diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. his symptoms first started when he found himself out of breath after walking up a single hill in his neighborhood. ""i got to the top and i couldn't breathe,"" said wilson. it took multiple similar events before doctors discovered he had pulmonary hypertension or a type of high blood pressure in the lungs that indicates the heart is working overtime and possibly damaged. that diagnosis led to doctors discovering scarring in his lungs. komo evans wilson, a man

Article 7 - for those not running, training can be just as taxing
rebecca, who says her husband talks about his training “incessantly,” could be in for a long winter if her husband meets his goal of attaining a qualifying time for the boston marathon. photo “usually after that first weekend in november, i think, o.k., now we have our friday nights and saturday mornings back,” she said in an interview. “but he’s not the kind of guy who will just say, ‘great, i qualified — now i can take it easy.’ he’ll want to do really well next spring. so it’s not going to end for me.” the all-consumed runner can make his co-workers feel as if they, too, are in an endurance event. sunday mornings are popular for long training runs, sometimes 20 miles or more; monday mornings can be grueling for the colleague in the neighboring cubicle who hears the stride-by-stride retelling of that run. and no one knows the true agony of blisters on the feet until he has heard his co-worker describe the arc of their progression — from development to drainage — in excruciating detail. the colleagues of jaime sperling, the communications manager at the world monuments fund in manhattan, are continually reminded that there is a marathoner in their midst. “i know i was a nightmare training for my first marathon, in 2004,” sperling said in an e-mail message. “icing my knees at work, worrying out loud about my mileage,

Article 8 - an untested two set the women’s pace
mary keitany of kenya, the 2009 world half-marathon champion, who also made her marathon debut, finished third in 2:29:01. photo kiplagat, 31, is the first kenyan to win the women’s race since 2003. she used patience to propel herself to victory, staying tucked at the back of a lead pack of about a dozen runners through most of the race, which started at a plodding 5:48-per-mile pace through 10 kilometers, or 6.2 miles. she shared the lead along with flanagan and keitany at mile 22. flanagan, 29, led by a forearm’s length as they entered central park and gained momentum with a 4:48-per-mile pace. keitany then started to create a step of distance. as flanagan strode down a slight hill approaching 24 miles, her pained face foretold the last two miles. kiplagat then led keitany on a breakaway and the two africans staged what was presumed to be a shoulder-to-shoulder battle to the finish. but as she passed mile 25, kiplagat created a five-second gap of ahead of keitany, and flanagan and finished well. “when we started, my body did not respond,” kiplagat said of the beginning of the race. “i had to wait until 24 miles; that

Article 9 - elite marathoner is still learning
before hendrick ramaala became a marathon champion, he tried out for soccer at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg. when he did not make the team, he ran on a grass track to stay in shape while studying law. but instead of practicing law, he dedicated himself to elite distance running. ramaala is preparing to return to the new york city half-marathon on aug. 16 and to his eighth new york city marathon on nov. 1. liz robbins q. how do you stay motivated without a coach? a. i love the sport of running. i enjoy getting out and doing distance, going to races and competing, watching others run, reading about the sport. when i get an opportunity to run in big races, i get motivated to train harder, to focus; i take it as an honor. when i lose a race or run badly, i get motivated to work harder. when i run well, i get motivated to do better the next time. i train with a group of guys, and they motivate me as they are younger and hungrier for results. i am still learning new things from other runners and still from mistakes we all commit in training and races. i listen to my body and try to do what it tells me to do. i can feel when i am too tired to train or when i am ready for a race. a coach cannot feel that for me. q.what advice would you give to

Article 10 - race officials confirm that 2 died after marathon
two of the 37,899 finishers of the new york city marathon on sunday died after crossing the finish line, according to the new york road runners, the organizer of the event. the fire department added that at least two others collapsed on the course with heart attacks before they were revived and taken to a hospital. ''for us at new york road runners, there is nothing harder than when two of our athletes don't return home,'' the race director, mary wittenberg, said monday morning. one of the runners was carlos jose gomes, 58, of brazil. he fell unconscious shortly after completing the race in 4 hours 12 minutes 15 seconds. a resident of s?paulo, gomes was pronounced dead at lenox hill hospital at 5:21 p.m. an autopsy monday revealed that he had a pre-existing heart condition and died of a heart attack, said ellen borakove, a spokeswoman for the chief medical examiner's office. the road runners did not release details of the second fatality. but the staten island advance reported that joseph marotta, 66, of tompkinsville died, apparently of a heart attack, hours after finishing his fourth new york city marathon. he walked the course in 9:16:46. dr. william j. cole, a cardiologist who is a clinical assistant professor at new york university's school of medicine, said that in a field of close to 40,

Title: standard chartered kl marathon ’13
Content: the last time i ran a long distance run was back in early april for malaysia women marathon. that was almost 6 months ago. so this time, my only preparation prior to the marathon was a run at bukit aman a week before. -_- i was actually contemplating whether or not to run this marathon. honestly, i really really like really lacked fitness since training is not included in my running vocab. sheeshh!! anyhoo, i went to bed at around 11 pm, set my alarm clock at 2.30 am and thought, if i wake up feeling ok i would just run. i felt headache as i was preparing all my running essentials before going to bed. to make things worse, i vomited after brushing my teeth. not sure why but my ‘red flag’ is coming so i suspected it was the pms. ok… should i run? or should i not? by 3.30 am, i was already at dataran merdeka. a lot of runners were already there; stretching and warming up. the crowds were bigger this time around as the number of participants reached a record of 33,000 overall runners! from that number, full marathon contributed 4,559 runners. quite a big number (in malaysia), i must say. amazingly enough, at 2.30 am, i woke up feeling rather good. the headache was gone. so let’s do it! my sister and her running partner in their costume while heading to the starting line, a girl called my name. she said she’s my blog reader. hi nano! *waves* honestly, i was a bit startled when she said that cos i never thought people would recognize me outside. haha… ready to start i ran with banana man and iron man! hahaha… we were flagged off at 4.30 am. i felt slightly nervous but my plan was simple; just run, jog or brisk walk. it was the same route as last year, and the year before, and before before before. haha… they never change the route pon. oh.. there’s another thing that also didn’t change. i suffered the leg cramp as i reached bukit bintang area, which was after the 21 km check point. it was exactly the same spot as last year!! is this god’s hint that i should just run half marathon next year? hmmmm…. running around kl that morning was really trying; as it was such a scorching hot day. i slowed down at jalan ipoh and jalan kuching as my legs were acting up, perhaps due to the heat. not long after, i felt a tap on my shoulder. i looked to the side and saw uncle oliver. he asked me to keep on going. seeing his perseverance, i felt ashamed of myself so i tried to pace him but man, this uncle was quite fast despite being a 70-year-old. after walking for

Marathon Mania: The Unseen Toll on Runners' Bodies

Running a marathon is an incredible feat, but it's not just the physical endurance that comes into play. The human body undergoes significant changes during and after the event. Blood flow to the stomach decreases, leading to discomfort, while all muscle fibers are utilized to complete the 26.2-mile distance.

The digestive system also plays a crucial role in marathon running. Runners often avoid eating heavy meals before the race, as this can disrupt digestion. Additionally, carbohydrates stored in muscles deplete during the run, making mid-race snacks necessary for some runners.

However, not everyone is a seasoned runner. For those new to the sport, training can be just as taxing as the actual event. Long runs and intense workouts can affect daily life, causing colleagues to feel like they're in an endurance event themselves.

Elite marathoners still have much to learn about their bodies. Even world-class athletes need motivation and guidance to stay on track. For some, running is a passion that drives them forward, while others rely on group training and self-motivation to push through challenges.

But the risks of marathon running are very real. Two runners who completed the recent New York City Marathon have passed away due to heart-related issues. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of pre-existing medical conditions and the need for caution when pushing one's body to its limits.

Despite these risks, many runners continue to push themselves to new heights

Title: The Unseen Struggles of Everyday Life

As we navigate the complexities of modern life, it's easy to overlook the subtle yet significant challenges that many people face. A recent study on a zero-carb diet revealed that even with careful planning and execution, setbacks can occur. One individual experienced a bout of diarrhea after consuming high amounts of fat, highlighting the importance of monitoring one's body's response to new foods.

In other news, a high school student in Japan shared their personal struggle with acute leukemia, sparking concern among friends and family. The student's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking medical attention when symptoms persist or worsen over time.

For those who suffer from chronic conditions like asthma, everyday life can be a constant battle. A recent post discussed the challenges of managing bronchospasm, highlighting the need for self-care and awareness.

In the world of productivity, a writer reflected on the common misconception that ""time management problems"" are solely the result of poor planning. Instead, they argued that underlying issues such as strategy, priorities, and internal systems can have a more significant impact on one's ability to manage time effectively.

Travelers often face unique challenges when exploring foreign countries. Dehydration is a common affliction, especially in tropical climates. Recognizing the early warning signs of dehydration – such as nausea, headaches, and dark urine – can help prevent this condition from becoming severe.

The use of phrases like ""unleash their inner Jedi"" and the emphasis on the magical sense of control created by the Myo device are red flags that suggest this article is not based on factual information. Additionally, the tone of the article is overly promotional and lacks a critical perspective, which is also typical of fake news articles. In contrast, the Reliable News Article presents a balanced view of emerging technologies and their implications for personal freedom and autonomy, making it a more credible source of information.","""Emerging Technologies Raise Concerns About Personal Freedom and Surveillance""

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, concerns are growing about the impact on personal freedom and surveillance. Recent innovations in wearable devices, smartphones, and social media have raised questions about who has access to our personal data and how it is being used.

The integration of microchips into brain tissue, predicted to become widespread within 75 years, has sparked debate about the potential for control over individual behavior. While proponents argue that such technology could improve communication and productivity, critics warn of a loss of autonomy and freedom.

Meanwhile, advancements in wearable devices are enabling new forms of monitoring and surveillance. A recent study found that voice-activated technology can be more distracting than traditional cellphone use, posing a significant risk to road safety.

Social media is also being explored as a tool for emergency response, with researchers developing systems that can detect falls and alert authorities in real-time. However, this raises concerns about the potential for mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy.

As technology continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the implications for personal freedom and autonomy. The development of new technologies must be balanced against the need to protect individual rights and prevent abuse of power.","Advances in Technology and Medicine Bring New Hope for Stroke Patients and Others with Brain Injuries

Recent breakthroughs in robotics, neuroscience, and medicine are offering new hope for individuals affected by stroke and brain injuries. Researchers have been working tirelessly to develop innovative devices and technologies that can aid in rehabilitation and recovery.

One such device is the Myomo brace, which uses electrodes to sense electrical activity in the muscles and provides assistance with movement. Users report feeling a sense of empowerment as they regain control over their limbs. Another area of research focuses on the use of sensory substitution, where one type of information is replaced by another to help individuals who have lost a sense.

In addition, scientists are exploring ways to enhance communication for those with neurological disorders. A recent study has shown that brain implants can enable people with ALS to communicate more effectively. Researchers are also working on developing devices that can increase sex drive without the need for medication.

Furthermore, advances in virtual reality and wearable technology are being harnessed to create new experiences and environments. For example, a device called the Meeting Pot uses coffee aromas to signal to users that their colleagues are gathering for a break. This technology aims to promote social interaction and community building in the workplace.

These innovations demonstrate the rapid progress being made in fields such as neuroscience, robotics, and medicine. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the years to come.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

cnn: your behavior will be controlled by a brain chip % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) smart phone will be implanted within 75 years by paul joseph watson, infowars: a new cnn article predicts that within 75 years people will have embedded microchips within their brain that will allow their behavior to be controlled by a third party. the story, entitled smartphone of the future will be in your brain, offers a semi-satirical look at transhumanism and the idea of humans becoming part cyborg by having communications devices implanted in their body. predicting first the widespread popularity of wearable smartphones, already in production by google, the article goes on to forecast how humans will communicate by the end of the century. “technology takes a huge leap in 75 years. microchip can be installed directly in the user’s brain. apple, along with a handful of companies, makes these chips. thoughts connect instantly when people dial to “call” each other. but there’s one downside: “advertisements” can occasionally control the user’s behavior because of an impossible-to-resolve glitch. if a user encounters this glitch — a 1 in a billion probability — every piece of data that his brain delivers is uploaded to companies’ servers so that they may “serve customers better.” the tone of the cnn piece is somewhat sophomoric, but the notion that humans will eventually merge with machines as the realization of

kardia band for apple watch may help detect heart irregularities % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) apple is getting serious about health with a new accessory for its watch product. taking advantage of the fitness craze surrounding wearable devices, alivecor has launched the kardia band, a wrist band designed for apple watch that’s actually a medical-grade electrocardiogram (ekg) monitor. alivecor has already brought ekg technology to smartphones, and is expected to receive fda approval for the band within the next few months. while there are already some wearables that incorporate a heart rate monitor for fitness tracking, the big difference with the kardia band is what’s inside. most current trackers use an led light that works by illuminating the wearer’s capillaries in order to track his or her blood flow. the kardia band uses a medical-grade integrated sensor that provides a much more accurate reading and can detect heartbeat irregularities responsible for strokes and other heart-related problems. when something isn’t right, the wearer is alerted via his or her smartphone app. this data, combined with voice recordings by the user, caloric intake and exercise information, is all combined to provide a bigger picture about the user’s overall cardiac health that can be accessed by his or her physician. “kardia band for apple watch represents both the future of proactive heart health and the introduction of the wearable medtech category,” said alive

deaf, hard-of-hearing students perform first test of sign language by cell phone % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) university of washington engineers are developing the first device able to transmit american sign language over us cellular networks. the tool is just completing its initial field test by participants in a uw summer program for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. ”this is the first study of how deaf people in the united states use mobile video phones,” said project leader eve riskin, a uw professor of electrical engineering. the mobileasl team has been working to optimize compressed video signals for sign language. by increasing image quality around the face and hands, researchers have brought the data rate down to 30 kilobytes per second while still delivering intelligible sign language. mobileasl also uses motion detection to identify whether a person is signing or not, in order to extend the phones’ battery life during video use. the uw field test is using phones imported a couple of years ago from europe, but mobileasl software could potentially run on any device. credit: university of washington transmitting sign language as efficiently as possible increases affordability, improves reliability on slower networks and extends battery life, even on devices that might have the capacity to deliver higher quality video. this summer’s field test is allowing the team to see how people use the tool in their daily lives and what obstacles they encounter. eleven participants are testing the phones for three weeks. they meet with the research

new temporary tattoo lets you control your phone from your wrist % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) scientists from mit microsoft research labs recently changed the game for the future of wearables with temporary tattoos that can control computers, change color, and transmit data via near field communication (nfc). as detailed on mit’s website, these tattoos are actually made of electrically-conductive gold leaf, which is transformed into working technology by designing a circuit in any graphic software, stamping out the circuit in gold, attaching a few materials to make the tattoo interactive, and then simply applying the gold to skin like a regular temporary tattoo (apply a damp sponge and peel off the paper backing). the tattoo itself can be removed from the skin at any time, and gold is skin-friendly, too. appropriately, the researchers have decided to call this technology duoskin. and already, it has several interesting uses, described as input, output, and communication by mit. for input, the tattoo can be used for a variety of purposes, like trackpads, buttons, and sliders—you can even control the volume of music on your smartphone from your skin. for output, the tattoo can actually be used as a display, with a color change of the tattoo being triggered by thin heating elements within it—like to show a change in your body temperature or to reflect your current emotional state. and for communication, the tattoo can be used to store and transfer data

Article 5 - lastest graphene research could lead to improvements in bluetooth headsets & other wireless devices
lastest graphene research could lead to improvements in bluetooth headsets & other wireless devices % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) researchers at the uc riverside bourns college of engineering have built and successfully tested an amplifier made from graphene that could lead to more efficient circuits in electronic chips, such as those used in bluetooth headsets and toll collection devices in cars. graphene, a single-atom thick carbon crystal, was first isolated in 2004 by andre geim and konstantin novoselov, who won the nobel prize in physics this month for that work. graphene has many extraordinary properties, including superior electrical and heat conductivity, mechanical strength and unique optical absorption. the demonstration at ucr of the graphene amplifier with signal processing functions is a major step forward in graphene technology because it is a transition from individual graphene devices to graphene circuits and chips, said alexander balandin, a professor of electrical engineering, who performed the work along with a graduate student and researchers at rice university. the triple-mode amplifier based on graphene has advantages over amplifiers built from conventional semiconductors, such as silicon, said balandin, who is also chair of the uc riverside materials science and engineering program. the graphene amplifier reveals greater functionality and a faster speed because of graphene’s electrical ambipolarity (current conduction by negative and positive charges). it can be switched between different modes of operation by a simple change of applied voltage. these

Article 6 - fascinating study of purported ‘phone calls from the dead’ phenomena: some confirmation
though his report is titled, “failure to replicate electronic voice phenomenon,” it admits partial success in replication. while dr. barušs could not provide the clear, hard proof of evp he set out to, he was able to detect what sounded like voices, and even some words that his assistant felt may have come from a deceased acquaintance of hers. barušs replicated evp in a weak sense, he said, but not a strong one. he raised some interesting points, however, as to the difficulties of studying this subject and established some protocol that could be used for further investigation. ghost hunting in the lab as he prepared to begin his investigation, barušs met with mark macy in boulder, calif. macy had taken photos he said contained spirit images and had also tried to prove the existence of other realms through evp recordings. macy gave barušs some advice on how to proceed, as recounted by barušs: “he emphasized two things: the more successful experiments have been the result of spiritual purpose so that spiritual integrity is necessary on the part of itc researchers, and the ability to obtain anomalous voices and images is dependent upon the establishment of a contact field through regular and persistent effort.” could an attempt to scientifically verify evp also have a sufficiently spiritual purpose or integrity behind it? as to establishing a “contact field,” barušs noted that “the parameters for the development of such a field, other than, presumably, the prerequisite of

Article 7 - voice-activated technology more distracting than talking on cellphone: aaa
voice-activated technology more distracting than talking on cellphone: aaa % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) hands-free technology may be a convenient way for drivers to text or talk on the phone while keeping their hands on the wheel but, according to a new aaa foundation for traffic safety study, such actions are even more distracting and dangerous than using a traditional cellphone. the aaa’s distracted driving analysis, the most comprehensive study of its kind to look at the mental distraction of drivers, is proof positive that motorists should not use any voice-to-text features while their vehicle is in motion. voice-activated technology has allowed more and more people to work while they are driving leading to distraction and slower reaction times. drivers who use the technology often miss visual cues, which can result in not seeing stop signs, traffic lights, even pedestrians. another problem the aaa foresees is a marked increase in infotainment systems in new vehicles by 2018. “there is a looming public safety crisis ahead with the future proliferation of these in-vehicle technologies,” said aaa president and ceo robert l. darbelnet in a press release. “it’s time to consider limiting new and potentially dangerous mental distractions built into cars, particularly with the common public misperception that hands-free means risk-free.” the aaa enlisted the services of cognitive distraction expert dr. david strayer and his research team at the university of utah to measure brainwaves, eye movement and

Article 8 - help i’ve fallen, and social media answers the call
when an elderly person suffers a fall it is in their best interests that help arrives as soon as possible, and for this reason most elderly people wear some form of alarm system that lets them contact emergency services directly when the worst happens. therefore, with an ever ageing population, taking care of the elderly is a huge societal challenge and a priority for the eu, particularly considering injuries suffered by the elderly put a huge burden on heathcare services. now researchers are working on a way to connect fall alarms to the latest communications method: social media. fareseeing is an eu-funded project that brings together 11 project partners with the aim of getting to the bottom of how we discover when elderly people have fallen and how we can make cost savings in this area. ‘the project has established the world’s largest database containing information on the movements of the elderly just before and just after they suffer a fall,’ says researcher babak farshchian from the foundation for scientific and industrial research at the norwegian institute of technology (sintef), one of the project partners. ‘this is made possible by sensors fixed to a belt worn on the hip which registers if the wearer feels faint or weak in the legs.’ taking a preventative approach, based on the data collected so far the researchers say it is possible to predict a person’s next fall with greater accuracy and therefore alert him or her to sit or lie down when they could be in danger. social media can also intervene when preventative measures fail and an elderly person suffers

“this is an area that’s exploding,” said hermano igo krebs, a principal research scientist at m.i.t. and one of the first scientists to envision robot-assisted therapy for stroke patients and others with brain injuries and neurological disorders. “there are now a hundred groups around the world working on this. in 5 to 10 years, i expect we’ll see these kinds of devices in all major clinics and rehab hospitals in the developed world, and even in patients’ homes.” when ms. o’regan first tried the myomo device, in october 2006, her arm was positioned in the metal and plastic brace and electrodes were placed on her biceps and triceps to sense electrical activity. initially, her arm was locked at a 90-degree angle; when she tried to extend it, the brace stepped in and her arm stretched out in front of her. “at first it felt weird and foreign,” she said. “you have all these little muscles that are suddenly awake for the first time in 20 years. but as i went back and practiced” — three times a week for about six weeks — “it felt like my arm was doing the straightening and bending itself, just with some assistance.” “it was extremely encouraging,” she added, noting that with the brace on she was able to practice tasks like folding towels, opening drawers and lifting a yoga mat from a chair to a table. one time, she was delivering mail at work

like millions of people who work in offices, dr. itiro siio of tamagawa university in tokyo is familiar with the power of coffee -- that is, its capacity to foster good will among office workers by bringing them together around the coffee machine and encouraging informal conversation. a computer scientist and a moderate coffee drinker, dr. siio came up with the idea of blending coffee with technology in a community-building tool for the workplace. his device, the meeting pot, consists of a coffee machine with a heat sensor, wireless transmitter and several scattered units that yield the aroma of coffee. when someone in the office goes to the lounge and starts making coffee, the transmitter sends a signal to aroma units on workers' desks. each unit is a glass box containing a sachet of coffee grains and equipped with a tiny fan. upon receiving the signal, the fan starts blowing air through the sachet, and the inviting smell of coffee drifts out of the box. it is a subtle signal that beckons: ''co-workers are gathering for a break -- would you like to join in?'' meeting pot may sound like a needlessly fancy alternative to poking your head into cubicles and asking who wants to hang out in the coffee room, but the purpose of dr. siio's research is more than fanciful. the coffee-aroma generator is one of many displays being developed that are aimed at pleasing the senses while presenting information. advertisement continue reading the main story this year dr. si

sex how do women really know if they are having an orgasm? dr nicole prause is challenging bias against sexual research to unravel apparent discrepancies between physical signs and what women said they experienced it’s not always clear if a woman is really having an orgasm, as meg ryan demonstrated in when harry met sally. photograph: everett/rex shutterstock olivia solon in san francisco 09.00 09.01 in the nascent field of orgasm research, much of the data relies on subjects self-reporting, and in men, there’s some pretty clear physiological feedback in the form of ejaculation. but how do women know for sure if they are climaxing? what if the sensation they have associated with climax is actually one of the the early foothills of arousal? and how does a woman know when if she has had an orgasm? neuroscientist dr nicole prause set out to answer these questions by studying orgasms in her private laboratory. through better understanding of what happens in the body and the brain during arousal and orgasm, she hopes to develop devices that can increase sex drive without the need for drugs. understanding orgasm begins with a butt plug. prause uses the pressure-sensitive anal gauge to detect the contractions typically associated with orgasm in both men and women. combined with eeg, which measures brain activity, this allows for a more accurate picture of a woman’s arousal and orgasm. dr nicole prause has founded liberos to study brain stimulation and desire

Article 8 - facebook in $2 billion deal for virtual reality company
with the deal, facebook is the latest silicon valley company to invest in wearable hardware that reimagines how people will one day interact with information and other forms of content. google has taken a different approach with glass, its high-tech eyewear that overlays maps, messages and other data on a transparent lens in front of people’s eyes, through which they can still view their surroundings. the acquisition is one of several bets that facebook, with about 1.2 billion users worldwide, is making in its effort to anticipate the future and secure its dominance of social communication. for example, last month, the company announced it would buy whatsapp, a mobile messaging app, for $16 billion plus as much as $3 billion in future payouts. that purchase was a bet on the fast growth in mobile messages, a type of one-to-one communication that largely bypasses facebook. more recently, the company has tried to leverage its strong position in mobile applications into new mobile markets, and mr. zuckerberg seemed to suggest that oculus, which now requires the horsepower of a personal computer, could one day work on mobile devices. james mcquivey, an analyst with forrester research, questioned facebook’s strategy in buying oculus, because he does not believe virtual reality has compelling applications beyond gaming. “the fit is so poor,” he said. “you could easily have done some kind of partnership.” and brian blau, an analyst with the research firm gartner who worked in virtual reality

Content: gesture control device lets users ‘unleash their inner jedi’ % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! a canadian company wants consumers to ‘unleash their inner jedi.’ waterloo-based startup thalmic labs has launched myo, an armband that enables the wearer to use the electrical activity in his muscles to wirelessly control his computer, smartphone, tablet and other digital technologies. “using groundbreaking technology, myo is able to measure electrical activity in your muscles instantly,” reads the website. “the result is a seamless way to interact with computers, and a truly magical sense of control.” the myo senses gestures and movements through either muscle activity or motion sensing. “when sensing the muscle movements of the user, the device can detect changes in hand gesture right down to each individual finger,” the website says. “when tracking the positioning in space of the arm and hand, the device can detect subtle movements in all directions.” movements are detected quite quickly — sometimes even before the user’s hand begins to move. this happens “because the muscles are activated slightly before your fingers actually start moving, and we are able to detect the gesture before that happens.” getmyo.com image the bands, which comes in black or white, can control presentations, video, content, games, browse the internet, create music and edit videos to name a few functions. and, with developers continually dreaming up new ways to use myo, more options are on the way. the one-size-fits-all device is compatible with both windows and mac os and apis will also be available for ios and android developers to integrate myo on those platforms. the gadget uses bluetooth 4.0 low energy to communicate with the devices it is paired with. it features on-board, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, an arm processor and thalmic’s proprietary muscle activity sensors. the device, which is set to ship late this year, will retail for $149. only a limited number are available, but consumers can preorder the device. the company is also planning to launch a developer site with further information on apis and integration. post from: sitepronews: webmaster news & resources gesture control device lets users ‘unleash their inner jedi’ source:

""Emerging Technologies Raise Concerns About Personal Freedom and Surveillance""

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, concerns are growing about the impact on personal freedom and surveillance. Recent innovations in wearable devices, smartphones, and social media have raised questions about who has access to our personal data and how it is being used.

The integration of microchips into brain tissue, predicted to become widespread within 75 years, has sparked debate about the potential for control over individual behavior. While proponents argue that such technology could improve communication and productivity, critics warn of a loss of autonomy and freedom.

Meanwhile, advancements in wearable devices are enabling new forms of monitoring and surveillance. A recent study found that voice-activated technology can be more distracting than traditional cellphone use, posing a significant risk to road safety.

Social media is also being explored as a tool for emergency response, with researchers developing systems that can detect falls and alert authorities in real-time. However, this raises concerns about the potential for mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy.

As technology continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the implications for personal freedom and autonomy. The development of new technologies must be balanced against the need to protect individual rights and prevent abuse of power.

Advances in Technology and Medicine Bring New Hope for Stroke Patients and Others with Brain Injuries

Recent breakthroughs in robotics, neuroscience, and medicine are offering new hope for individuals affected by stroke and brain injuries. Researchers have been working tirelessly to develop innovative devices and technologies that can aid in rehabilitation and recovery.

One such device is the Myomo brace, which uses electrodes to sense electrical activity in the muscles and provides assistance with movement. Users report feeling a sense of empowerment as they regain control over their limbs. Another area of research focuses on the use of sensory substitution, where one type of information is replaced by another to help individuals who have lost a sense.

In addition, scientists are exploring ways to enhance communication for those with neurological disorders. A recent study has shown that brain implants can enable people with ALS to communicate more effectively. Researchers are also working on developing devices that can increase sex drive without the need for medication.

Furthermore, advances in virtual reality and wearable technology are being harnessed to create new experiences and environments. For example, a device called the Meeting Pot uses coffee aromas to signal to users that their colleagues are gathering for a break. This technology aims to promote social interaction and community building in the workplace.

These innovations demonstrate the rapid progress being made in fields such as neuroscience, robotics, and medicine. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we can expect to see even more exciting developments in the years to come.

It includes quotes from Dr. Patricia Wexler, which are not real and seem to be fabricated for comedic effect. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE is also fictional but attempts to mimic the style of a news article by including expert opinions and references to various topics. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the article is not based on actual events or experts. The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, appears to be a genuine piece of writing that explores themes related to identity, community, and human connection through a series of vignettes and references to various cultural touchstones.","Breaking News: Experts Weigh in on Earth's Safety and Human Well-being

In a series of recent statements, experts have offered insights into the current state of our planet and human well-being. According to one prominent figure, the sun is not expected to pose a significant threat to Earth, thanks to an advanced energy shield technology deployed by the Andromeda Council Engineering Biosphere.

Meanwhile, a renowned physician has emphasized the importance of achieving optimum health through self-awareness and personal development. Dr. Julia Bowlin's approach, outlined in her book ""To Me I Thee Wed,"" highlights the interconnectedness of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.

In contrast, a former police officer has expressed concerns about the state of law enforcement and the need for reform. Richard Chrisman's experience as a victim of his own department's ignorance has led him to advocate for greater transparency and accountability.

As we navigate these complex issues, it is essential to consider the role of personal growth and spiritual awareness in shaping our lives. A recent article on the Cassini mission highlights the human side of space exploration, with scientists attributing their spacecraft's personality to its creators' intentions.

In other news, a series of pagan events are taking place in London, exploring themes such as death, dying, and the afterlife. These events offer a unique opportunity for personal reflection and growth.

Ultimately, our individual choices and actions have a profound impact on the world around us. By prioritizing self-awareness, personal development, and spiritual growth, we can work towards creating a more harmonious and balanced society.","In the sweltering summer of 1960s Philadelphia, a complex web of relationships and identities was unfolding. Two women, Ivy Silver, a charismatic host of an astrology show on community radio, and Nettta Klein, a Jewish wig saleswoman, found themselves drawn to each other in unexpected ways.

Their tentative friendship blossomed amidst the city's racial tensions, as they navigated the blurred lines between their personal lives and public personas. Meanwhile, in another part of the world, a Danish film was exploring the complexities of human connection. ""Soap"" told the story of Charlotte, a beauty shop owner, and Veronica, her androgynous neighbor, who found themselves entwined in a passionate affair.

In the realm of science fiction, a disaster movie was unfolding on a global scale. The world was facing an impending catastrophe, one that would test humanity's resolve and ingenuity. As the clock ticked down, characters from all walks of life were racing against time to find a way to save themselves and their loved ones.

In the world of fashion, designer Marc Jacobs was hard at work, crafting intricate costumes for his upcoming show. His team was working tirelessly to bring his vision to life, with each outfit carefully designed to make a statement.

On stage, a new play was making waves in London's theater scene. ""Les Blancs"" was a powerful exploration of identity and community, set against the backdrop of a tumultuous world. The production was a testament to the enduring power of storytelling, as it brought audiences to their feet with its raw emotion and unflinching honesty.

As the curtain fell on another night in the theater, the city outside seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the next great challenge to arise.

Article 4 - triple water astrology – the anaretic degree! sun in scorpio 2015 newsletter
sun has started his transit through the intense, watery scorpio sign. the format this month will revert to the usual four topics, but due to time pressure i am going to use the ingress chart as the basis for the analysis. will sun entering sagittarius finally give me a break? lol the ingress chart is most interesting. sun makes a conjunction to apollon (transneptunian) in the critical degree of scorpio. it gives the impression of a magnetic, mysterious celebrity. this month is therefore somewhat geared towards more reclusive study and learning, although apollon is also about making yourself known and presenting a persistent, upbeat image to the world. apollon-sun at 0 scorpio is about presenting a powerful image of yourself, and teaching self or others in order to change your perspectives. thus the sun in scorpio theme begins this year in a manner we will not experience again. moon in the ingress chart is not only in pisces, but she is also trining sun in scorpio and she is making an exact conjunction with neptune retrograde. this links sun and moon harmoniously (easy flow between the conscious and subconscious, meshing vitality and purpose with the emotional base smoothly, a flowing link between the masculine and feminine, etc.). the rulers of sun and moon in the ingress chart therefore are also brought to attention: neptune (ruling pisces; imagination, idealism, spirituality) and pluto (ruling scorpio;

Article 6 - “incredible stories” from the cassini mission
“incredible stories” from the cassini mission headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! when cassini project scientist linda spilker thinks about her spacecraft, as it is out there gliding amidst the moons and rings of saturn, there are times when she envisions it as a dancer or ice skater, spinning and turning to look at all the different targets. “i picture cassini as a she,” spilker said, admitting to moments of anthropomorphizing, “because all good sailing ships are a she. she has these beautiful gold thermal blankets, and i see them as her golden flowing hair. i think she’s very joyful and curious and is definitely an explorer. that’s my view of what cassini looks like.” does your spacecraft seem to have a personality? that’s a question i asked every scientist and engineer who i interviewed for my book “incredible stories from space: a behind-the-scenes look at the missions changing our view of the cosmos,” which comes out on dec. 20, 2016. the answers varied, sometimes even among people who worked on the same mission. but, it seems, we humans can’t help but to sometimes think of our robots as being just like us. “there is a personality there,” spilker said of the cassini spacecraft, “and i think it is a reflection of the cassini team. we take good care of her and watch over her, making sure everything

Article 1 - astrologist meets wig seller in simmering ’60s
change is in the air in sylvan oswald’s “nightlands,” and neither its beneficiaries nor its potential victims know quite what to make of it. mr. oswald betrays a similar level of uncertainty about how to resolve the issues raised in his empathic if scattered memory play set amid the uneasy racial tensions of his hometown of philadelphia in the early 1960s. but even when he tries to jam too many stories and styles into the production, which opened monday night at the here arts center under the auspices of new georges, he and his inventive director, tamilla woodard, shrewdly double back to the two main characters and their all-too-plausible inconsistencies. photo they are ivy silver (a powerful rachel leslie), the black host of an astrology show on community radio, and netta klein (polly lee, whose coiffed discontent evokes julianne moore in “the hours” and “far from heaven”), a jewish wig saleswoman. netta, seeking a respite from her stultifying marriage, heads to a combustible, predominantly black section of the city for astrology lessons with ivy. as the two women’s tentative friendship develops in intriguing ways, mr. oswald and ms. woodard push the action beyond the play’s more purple passages. ms. leslie and ms. lee’s naturalistic performances are set into relief by a versatile supporting cast that sprints through a

Article 2 - can neighborly affection rewire sexuality?
photo “soap,” an austere danish film about the coupling of a beauty shop owner and the preoperative transsexual who lives downstairs, is so sensitively acted you can almost buy its premise that love (in this case, neighborly affection and dependence) might rewire sexuality. the directorial debut of pernille fischer christensen, the film is an anti-soap opera in the trappings of an old- fashioned sudsfest. chapters are introduced by a supercilious announcer who wonders, “why is it so hard for her to find happiness?” among other portentous questions. the double-edged device makes you reflect on the degree to which life imitates kitsch, while also calling attention to the unglamorous reality of its characters’ situations. adding another layer, the transsexual is addicted to an american soap opera, fragments of which are heard but not seen. charlotte (trine dyrholm), the attractive, hard-shelled beauty shop owner, and veronica, a k a ulrik (david dencik), her androgynous neighbor, live in a drab housing complex in an unidentified danish city. charlotte has just left kristian (frank thiel), her boyfriend of four years, to live by herself, but kristian refuses to let go. veronica ekes out a living sewing and turning tricks as a dominatrix who specializes in playing strict mommies who punish their naughty boys.

Article 3 - eyes wide shut
wright is well advised to be calm and seem neutral in his presentation of the scientology story, since the group has been known to make life miserable for its critics, its favorite weapon being the lawsuit, often brought in order to bury the defendant in legal costs and hassles. the purpose of a lawsuit is “to harass and discourage rather than to win,” hubbard said. perhaps, though, this knowledge that any mistake will be abnormally costly does lend added credibility to wright’s vast research and reporting. among the horrors wright either uncovers or borrows (with credit) from previous scientology exposés in time magazine and the st. petersburg (now tampa bay) times is “the hole,” a hellish double-wide trailer parked at a california resort owned by the church. forty or 50 people were housed there with no furniture or beds, eating leftovers, enduring cold-hose group showers. there are stories of people being beaten; and lots of stories of forced divorces, mandatory “disconnections” — orders not to talk with a spouse or friend who has offended in some way. but only once in 430 pages filled with lurid anecdotes did my skeptical antennas start to twitch. wright asserts that someone was punished by being “made to run around a pole in the desert for 12 hours a day, until his teeth fell out.” really? that’s the first thing that happens when you run in circles in the desert all day? i need to know

Article 4 - the self-manufacture of megan fox
“people expected ‘jennifer’s body’ to make so much money,” fox said flatly. “but i was doubtful. the movie is about a man-eating, cannibalistic lesbian cheerleader, and that pretty much eliminates middle america. it’s obviously a girl-power movie, but it’s also about how scary girls are. girls can be a nightmare.” fox paused and stared up at the ladies on “the view.” “ ‘jennifer’s body’ wasn’t rated pg-13 like ‘twilight,’ ” she continued. “it was a hard r, and kids couldn’t get in. so they bought a ticket to another movie and snuck in.” she smiled. “if i was to have a message, it would be to be a different kind of role model to girls. with ‘jennifer’s body,’ i want to say, it’s o.k. to be different from how you’re supposed to be. i worry that’s totally lost.” in the last month, fox and her team — her agent, chuck james, and her publicists, leslie sloane zelnick and dominique appel — have grown increasingly nervous about her media image. the lack of success of “jennifer’s body” highlighted their concern: the outrageousness that made fox an instant star was not attracting a paying audience, especially among females. they were hoping that hosting “s.n.l.” and some recent appearances on talk shows on which she seemed demure might help

Article 5 - gunshots underneath a gray sky
to his credit mr. green tries to break with the dour conventions of this glum, unadorned style of realism. for one thing, somewhat remarkably, “snow angels” is frequently quite funny — not in a glib or mocking way, but in the way that life, even at its worst, can be. even in despair and under duress, people make jokes, say silly things and even laugh. mr. katt and ms. sedaris are especially helpful in this regard, since they are able to suggest ridiculousness without making fun of the characters they are playing. and mr. rockwell has a similar gift, though glenn’s self-undermining jokiness — an aspect of the earnest optimism that seems to guarantee eventual failure and disappointment — is more pathetic than amusing. photo as for ms. beckinsale, her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like glenn. somewhat more credible is the sweet, tentative romance that springs up between arthur and a nerdy girl named lila (olivia thirlby, who played juno’s best pal). mr. angarano suggests a less frantic shia labeouf, and his scenes with ms. th

Article 6 - haunted orphans in havana, undone by the sheer passion and problems of life
like so many characters in latin american literature, the three major characters in fernando perez's lush, hallucinatory film ''life is to whistle'' walk around with an awareness of the supernatural that simultaneously inspires and oppresses them. as these passionate, troubled residents of havana, all three of them orphans, go about their lives, we have an acute sense of their being haunted and held back by religious and ancestral specters. the director's master stroke is his portrayal of their internal conflicts as a metaphor for the political and economic anxieties gripping cuba in the twilight of the castro era. although the communist government is barely mentioned, all three characters ultimately find themselves forced to choose between clinging to their self-restricting beliefs and shucking them off to live more autonomously. elpidio valdes (luis alberto garcia), a swarthy young musician and fisherman abandoned by his mother (symbolically named cuba), is consumed with guilt because he hasn't fulfilled his revolutionary destiny. elpidio's chance for liberation arrives in the form of chrissy (isabel santos), a greenpeace worker who sails into cuba in a hot-air balloon. the two carry on a passionate affair until it's time for her leave, and she invites him to fly away with her to the united states. julia (coralia veloz), a middle-aged social worker with a job in a home for the aged, is subject to spontaneous fainting spells

Article 7 - wasted
lightning on the sun by robert bingham. 291 pp. new york: doubleday. $23.95. it can be as difficult to understand other people's addictions as it is to understand their obsessive love affairs. if something isn't your object of desire, its appeal can remain obscure; all you see is the tortured lover, endlessly reaching. ''lightning on the sun'' is the first and last novel of robert bingham, a scion of the kentucky newspaper dynasty, who died of what appeared to be a heroin overdose last year at the age of 33, six months after getting married and five months before the publication of this book. he was also the author of a collection of short stories, ''pure slaughter value,'' published in 1997. while both books roam around various territories -- new york, love, cambodia, political strife, journalistic morality, the disorder and early sorrows of the freshly minted children of the upper class -- they are founded on a bedrock of addiction. his ill-fated characters are forever being pulled downward by an uncontrollable force, more powerful than love or money, whose charm bingham wisely never really explicates: it's just the thing, the shadow, a kind of bleak vocation. to say that his great subject was addiction is not to take anything away from his accomplishment as a writer; on the contrary, as an artist he was funny, mordant and quick. his brand of black comedy

Article 8 - destroying the earth, over and over again
alien invaders, tsunamis and asteroids have crashed into mr. emmerich’s oeuvre since he first blew up the white house in 1996 with a blue death ray, in “independence day.” (even the discovery channel followed suit with its own doomsday-theme reality series called “the colony.”) so how exactly did he make “2012,” which he calls “the mother of all disaster movies”? in “2012” mr. emmerich pits the accelerating entropy of the planet against a worldwide government conspiracy — noah’s ark meets “the x-files.” and he tries to top his previous disaster movies by ratcheting up the scale of destruction in the film’s 157 minutes. (this time he lets the aircraft carrier john f. kennedy, sitting in chesapeake bay, wipe out the white house.) he also slips in even more ridiculous jokes right before tragedy strikes. gordon (tom mccarthy) tells his love interest, kate (ms. peet), “i feel like something is pulling us apart.” then a gaping fissure opens between them in the aisle of the supermarket where they’re standing; it’s the beginning of an earthquake that eventually sends california sliding into the pacific. “it’s just a counterbalance to the suspense,” mr. emmerich said. the comic relief and the suspense come at a breakneck speed in “2012,” as in all emmerich movies. characters race to set

the building’s entire resources — from the dramaturgical department through to adam cork’s ravishing soundscape and a stage crew there to ensure that soutra gilmour’s set revolves — work in concert to remind us that hansberry was not just a one-play wonder immortalized for having written “a raisin in the sun.” the writing itself in “les blancs” is compelling, moment by moment, but it becomes clear just how thesis-mongering the play might seem in lesser hands. there is an american photographer on hand (the english actor elliot cowan) to act as our guide to this alternately brave and brutal new world. “i really do care about the place,” he insists rather clunkily midway through, and when others urge him later on to “write the truth,” it sounds a bit like hansberry’s memo to herself to do justice to a continent worlds apart from her own upbringing in chicago. the play is on more fertile ground in its depiction of how the mission dwellers and the africans coexist — at least up until a cataclysmic ending that places ms. atim tellingly at center stage. siân phillips, the veteran british actress who turns 83 next month, has a surpassingly moving moment near the end in which she recalls how her first glimpse of africa at age 28 prompted her to make this foreign land the place where she would spend her life. among the younger generation, the ever-lovely

Title: don’t let the sun catch you tanning
Content: the villain in danny boyle’s new sci-fi thriller “sunshine” is — spoiler alert! — a certain someone who wants our nearest star to go completely dim, even if all of humanity never gets to tan again. since you never get a good look at the culprit — it’s all very arty — you can never really rule out that the shadowy figure running around the spaceship causing trouble is not, in fact, the prominent manhattan dermatologist dr. patricia wexler. by her own admission, dr. wexler likes floaty amorphous clothes, even at the beach, and wishes she could install a personal rheostat on the titular center of our solar system. “i am pretty nuts,” she said, confessing that she even puts sunblock between her toes. she dates her hate-hate relationship with the sun all the way back to her childhood. “i was born a redhead with green eyes and freckles, and i had blistering sunburns as a child,” she said. “very early on i decided i was not going to be tall and blond and tan like christie brinkley.” advertisement continue reading the main story some wish she would lighten up, so to speak, about the whole thing, but no. “it’s not quite the mummy,” she said. “i look like gandhi. i’m always wrapped in lots of layers from donna karan, gauzy tops and pants and shrugs, a big hat from patricia underwood and jackie o sunglasses. my husband says to me, ‘can’t you go to the beach for once looking like a normal person?’ so i put on the tankini and go, and i come home looking like i was bought at a lobster farm. i’d rather be gandhi.”

Both articles discuss recent events and actions taken by the New York City Council, specifically regarding free speech protections and union access at markets. The language used is also consistent with reputable news sources, as seen in the mention of organizations like the New York Civil Liberties Union and the use of specific details about bills being introduced or voted on. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Power Play: Politicians' Hidden Agendas Exposed"" contains sensationalized claims and lacks concrete evidence to support its assertions, making it less similar to a reliable news article.","""Power Play: Politicians' Hidden Agendas Exposed""

A recent series of events has shed light on the inner workings of Washington D.C., revealing a web of deceit and manipulation by politicians. At the center of this power play are five key figures: Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Boehner, and McConnell.

These individuals have been accused of using their positions to further their own interests, often at the expense of the American people. Their actions have led to significant economic burdens on taxpayers, with some estimates suggesting that billions of dollars will be lost over the next decade.

One notable example is the recent Supreme Court decision on Medicaid expansion. While the court's ruling was seen as a victory for states' rights, critics argue that it has created a loophole that allows politicians to exploit federal funding without being held accountable.

Meanwhile, lawmakers have been accused of hypocrisy and broken promises. For instance, Senator Tester has taken millions in campaign contributions from lobbyists, despite his earlier claims of opposing such practices.

The situation is further complicated by the lack of transparency and accountability in government. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provides support to first responders, was recently blocked from coming up for a vote in Congress.

Black leaders have spoken out against these actions, with some accusing politicians of using their positions to undermine economic justice and perpetuate systemic inequality.

As the country grapples with the consequences of this power play, it is clear that something must be done to restore trust and accountability in government. The American people deserve better than to be manipulated by those in power for their own gain.","New York City Council Faces Backlash Over Free Speech Protections

The New York City Council has introduced over a dozen bills that critics say would restrict residents' and businesses' rights of expression. The measures, which include proposals to limit newspaper vending machines on sidewalks and require the American flag to be flown at the front of every parade, have been met with opposition from free speech advocates.

Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, described the bills as ""ill-advised"" and ""unconstitutional."" She warned that they would have the effect of restricting speech, some commercial and some political.

Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., Democrats are defending a bill aimed at reining in Wall Street. The measure, which would establish a fund to bury the costs of dismantling failing financial institutions, has been met with resistance from Republicans who claim it would tighten credit and cost jobs.

In North Hempstead, a vote on adopting the ward system for local government has been defeated, highlighting divisions within the community over issues of representation and accountability. The outcome has sparked debate about the role of local government in addressing social and economic concerns.

As the city council continues to grapple with these issues, some candidates are rebuffed from receiving public funds due to their failure to meet fundraising thresholds. This has raised questions about the fairness of the system and its impact on smaller campaigns.

In other news, the Iraqi cabinet has approved a draft oil law, which is seen as crucial to the country's economic development. The bill has been debated for months and has won unanimous approval from the cabinet.

These developments come as New York City prepares to face another election cycle, with candidates vying for office and seeking to address pressing issues such as public accommodations and employment practices.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(before it's news) dear conservatives: as early as today, harry reid could move to cut off all debate and try to ram the police and firefighter monopoly bargaining bill (s. 3194) into law. embittered senate democrats in the outgoing renegade “lame duck” congress are preparing a parting “going away” present for their big labor financiers — every police and firefighter’s paycheck on a platter. make no mistake. s. 3194 is designed to force virtually every firefighter and police officer in the country under union boss control. during these tough times, passage of the police and firefighter monopoly bargaining bill could be the final straw for cities and small communities that are already struggling to make ends meet. this legislative power grab will cost taxpayers billions. the record is clear. in jurisdictions where big labor has control over public employees, union officials guarantee citizens pay more in taxes and get less for their tax money in return. that’s why it’s vital you call senator reid directly at (202) 224-3542 and let his office know that this congress no longer represents the will of the american people and demand that he pull any version of s. 3194 off the senate calendar. this may be our last chance to convince democrat senate leader harry reid to back down.

Article 10 - medicaid and federalism
medicaid and federalism headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the less talked about, though hardly ignored, aspect of the supreme court’s recent obamacare decision is the fact that the court struck down the requirement that state’s expand medicaid coverage up to 133 percent above the federal poverty line (some states do so already), or lose their federal medicaid funding. the court ruled that while the federal government can provide strings for accepting new federal dollars, it cannot threaten to revoke already granted dollars if new strings are not adhered to. the latter is deemed coercive on the part of the federal government, and thus an unconstitutional violation of state sovereignty. the ruling essentially cuts in half the number of uninsured which the law was supposedly going to give coverage. while the court was right to strike the provision, the scope of the decision was insufficient and the distinction offered is strained and unworkable. congress must retain the power to revisit the law creating medicaid, as one congress cannot legally bind a future congress, which means there is no real mechanism to prevent them from changing the requirements on states to receive medicaid dollars. the error of the court is in not acknowledging that all federal dollars to states are coercive, whether they come with only carrots or include an explicit stick. all federal carrots eventually turn to sticks. transferring federal dollars to states erodes state sovereignty, undermines one of the primary benefits of federalism (competition and innovation in policy approaches) and reduces democratic accountability

Article 1 - not all speech is free, council says
the first amendment took a beating under the giuliani administration, free speech advocates say. now the city council seems to be flirting with the role of the city's designated first amendment opponent. since taking office in january, fresh-faced council members have introduced more than a dozen bills that bump up against free speech protections. some measures are resubmissions, like the two bills that would limit newspaper vending machines from sidewalks. but other measures, advocates say, signal another attack on residents' and businesses' rights of expression. one bill, supported by 13 lawmakers, would make it mandatory that the american flag be flown at the front of every parade. other bills would make it illegal to put stickers on pay phones and other structures, limit the size of ''for sale'' or ''for rent'' signs to six square feet, and bar supermarkets from distributing circulars in plastic bags. ''the bills range from the ill-advised to the silly to the downright unconstitutional,'' said donna lieberman, executive director of the new york civil liberties union, which brought 34 free speech cases against the city while rudolph w. giuliani was mayor. ''they would have the effect of restricting speech, some commercial, some political.'' lawmakers defend their proposals as responsible solutions to festering problems.

Article 2 - democrats defend bill to rein in wall street
democrats said republicans were misrepresenting the measure, adding that the fund would be established through assessments on major players in the field of high finance. photo “there are no taxpayer dollars that will be used,” said representative barney frank, democrat of massachusetts and chairman of the financial services committee, adding that the money would not be used to keep companies operating but only for the “burial costs” of dismantling them. both sides said they believed that the final vote on the measure, expected for friday, had implications for next year’s elections. democrats warned that house republicans, who appear to be virtually united against the measure, would be casting a risky vote if they aligned themselves against legislation seeking to protect the public from abusive financial practices and prevent another wall street collapse. “once again we find them siding with the special interests against the taxpayer, against the consumer,” said representative chris van hollen of maryland, chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee. “they are going to pay a very heavy price.” republicans said they believed they could make the case that the measure would tighten credit, cost jobs and give the government too much power over private enterprise. “i think those people who are concerned about consumers realize something needs to be done,” said representative scott garrett, a new jersey republican who sits on the financial services committee. “but substantiating and continuing a situation where you have bailouts, continuing a situation where you hurt jobs and expand the authority of government

Article 3 - in north hempstead, a vote about voting
propositions to adopt the ward system have been defeated in the towns of oyster bay, babylon, islip and southhampton. mr. cavaliere said his organization supported the proposal, but divisions in the community are clear, even among those who served on an 11-member town commission that studied the issue for 18 months. at the recent forum where mr. cavaliere spoke, three commission members spoke in favor of the ward system, all of them republicans; three others, all democrats, opposed it. joseph j. galante, the town's democratic leader and chairman of the commission, said he initially favored councilmanic districts. but he said the study convinced him that the best solution --not offered in the referendum -- would be to have two at-large councilmen and four representatives of councilmanic districts. a strictly councilmanic system would lead to parochialism and an attitude of ''what can i do for my district, and the heck with the rest of the town,'' he said. rudolph clark, a black member of the commission, said he favored a ward system and six council members to increase the chances for a minority member on the town board. according to the 2000 census, 6.1 percent of the town's population is black. ''i'm tired of the white establishment making a determination of who are the palatable black leaders,'' he said. ''i am pleading with my co-residents to exercise

Article 4 - council candidates rebuffed on public funds
maria baez, a candidate in the 14th district in the bronx, said that she, too, had looked forward to receiving a check, but that she was late in beginning the application process and was told that she needed to resubmit some forms. but none of ms. baez's democratic competitors received the public money either. in several races, most or all candidates did not receive matching funds. to qualify for the program, candidates in city council races must raise at least $5,000 in contributions from city residents, including 50 residents from their own districts. they must also manage to stay on the ballot, and must have an opponent. those who meet the requirements, and file according to the finance board's regulations, are rewarded with the city's generous 4-to-1 matching formula, up to $75,350 for the primary. in those districts where participants face a ''high-spending nonparticipant,'' like michael r. bloomberg in the mayor's race, said molly watkins, a spokeswoman for the finance board, the matching formula jumps to 5-to-1, up to $91,333 for the primary. some candidates have not yet filed the financial information necessary to receive funds and are subject to fines if they do not, ms. watkins said. but many of the council candidates who were denied financing earlier this week simply could not meet the $5,000 threshold, an amount that has been a matter of some

Article 5 - iraqi cabinet approves draft of oil law
since last year, senior bush administration officials and top american commanders here have said a new oil law is crucial to the country’s political and economic development, and they have been pressuring iraqi leaders to make passage of the law a priority. in recent weeks, ambassador zalmay khalilzad, the senior american envoy here, has been in intense talks with kurdish leaders in the north to overcome their objections to the draft. iraqi officials say mr. khalilzad’s negotiations were crucial to winning unanimous cabinet approval today. since the american-led invasion of 2003, iraqi politics has often been split bitterly along ethnic and sectarian lines, and that kind of conflict could still stall passage of the oil law in parliament. drafts have been debated for months by a committee overseeing the writing of the law before the cabinet finally approved it. “at the end of the day, we all supported this thing because it’s workable for all the parties and is all-inclusive,” said barham salih, a deputy prime minister and the head of the committee. several members of the committee said in interviews that they were confident that parliament would ultimately endorse the law, but perhaps only after heated arguments. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york

the bloomberg administration yesterday joined the city council speaker, gifford miller, in appealing a state supreme court ruling on a revision of the city's term limits law, even though the mayor had initially vetoed the measure. in a 24-page legal brief, michael a. cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, sided with the council in saying that justice gerard h. rosenberg of state supreme court in brooklyn had misinterpreted the law when he threw out the council's revised version earlier this month. the judge ruled that by amending a law that was passed by voters in a referendum, the council had exceeded its authority. ''the mayor vetoed the bill, saying that it was unwise for the council to alter term limits that had been adopted by the voter,'' mr. cardozo said in the brief. ''however, the mayor's veto message made it clear that he did not question the council's authority to pass this legislation.'' in september, the council overrode the mayor's veto by a wide margin. the council's appeal carries heavy political consequences for mr. miller and five other council members who face being barred from seeking re-election to two-year terms in november. advertisement continue reading the main story the ruling by justice rosenberg, mr. cardozo said, ignored well-established case law on the subject.

Article 8 - new campaign finance rules skip unions
the city council speaker, christine c. quinn, the daughter of a retired union electrician who was first elected in 1999, has received a total of nearly $70,000 in union contributions. one of her top aides, maura keaney, is the former political director for unite here, which represents hotel, restaurant and apparel workers. ms. quinn has repeatedly drawn a distinction between a union negotiating with the city for better pay and benefits, and developers and corporations vying for lucrative land deals or government contracts. “the situation here is to require that everyone gets treated the same way,” she said yesterday. “a union or a pac can give one contribution, whatever the maximum is for the office in question. someone who did business with the city of new york prior to this could have every person in the business give a contribution of the maximum level allowed to that office. so i think this in fact much more levels the playing field.” if a union does get involved in a land-use application or a contract that is not labor related, she said, it would be bound by the same contribution restrictions. only four council members voted against the bill, citing concerns that the contribution limits would give an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates while restricting the speech of certain groups. “the fact that we’re leaving out interest groups — unions in this particular case — at the expense of the rest of the city is questionable at best,” councilman vincent ignizio, a staten island republican

Article 9 - bush opposes more aid now for new york
an assistant to a house leader, while not dooming the proposal entirely, said: ''they're just not going to get all that. conservatives in congress are watching to see that nobody takes advantage of this crisis to fund their own pork projects.'' another assistant to a prominent republican senator urged mr. pataki, a republican, to abandon some of the more excessive requests, particularly when congress needs to cover the rising cost of the nation's war effort. ''those extraneous things that have nothing to do with recovering from the attacks will have to fall by the wayside,'' the assistant said. ''you can't go overboard on these things.'' that sentiment is being echoed even by members of new york's delegation, who complain that they had little say in outlining the plan that mr. pataki submitted. the biggest concern they have is that mr. pataki's request undercuts real needs when some conservatives in congress are looking for any reason to deny giving new york significantly more aid than it has already got. the governor and mayor rudolph w. giuliani have taken different tacks on seeking more federal aid. the mayor, most notably with a budget modification, charts and graphs, tried to demonstrate that he had put his own house in order -- cutting agency budgets, freezing $1 billion in spending -- just hours before he appeared with mr. pataki to announce the $54 billion aid package. and he stressed that the package should not be expanded to include extraneous things

Article 10 - first lady admits error; lazio calls it crime
representative rick a. lazio, mrs. clinton's republican opponent, said her use of government property for political purposes, no matter how tiny the return, was illegal. he said the activity fit a pattern of fund-raising improprieties, including the use of the lincoln bedroom in the white house by people who had contributed to mrs. clinton's campaign. in 1997, congressional republicans conducted an inquiry into president clinton's fund-raising for his re-election campaign, contending that a white house database of names had been used by the president and the democratic national committee to solicit contributions. the democrats denied the charges. ''i think that they believe there are two laws -- one that applies to them and one that applies to the rest of us,'' mr. lazio said of the clintons after visiting a high school near syracuse. ''in this particular case, this isn't just something that is improper, this is something that is illegal.'' mr. lazio suggested that mrs. clinton should be prosecuted, ''the same thing that happens when any of the rest of us commit a crime, if in fact that's what happened here.'' his campaign manager, bill dal col, issued an even harsher statement. ''new yorkers are disgusted by this abuse of the public trust,'' mr. dal col said, ''and they will not elect a senate candidate whose campaign has so brazenly broken the law in pursuit of

Title: council votes to guarantee union access at markets
Content: the city council yesterday voted to ensure union access at new york's wholesale public markets, rejecting the protests of mayor rudolph w. giuliani, who said the council was opening the door to organized crime. the council measure, first proposed after a 1998 labor dispute at the hunts point produce market in queens, would revise a 1997 law governing such markets that is the cornerstone of mr. giuliani's crackdown on mob influence at the markets. it was one of three bills passed over republican objections yesterday, including two intended to assist welfare recipients in the city's workfare program. the mayor has threatened to veto all three bills, and his aides say the democratic leadership of the council brought them to a vote simultaneously after more than a year of committee review in an effort to portray mr. giuliani's relations with the council as combative during his campaign for the united states senate. ''these are three moribund bills rejected by the mayor,'' said thomas v. ognibene, one of 6 republicans on the 51-member council. ''for us to engage in this kind of political shenanigans for political reasons is a disgrace.'' all the republicans voted against the bills. advertisement continue reading the main story before the council's hearing, mr. giuliani called the markets bill ''outrageous'' at his daily city hall news conference.

New York City Council Faces Backlash Over Free Speech Protections

The New York City Council has introduced over a dozen bills that critics say would restrict residents' and businesses' rights of expression. The measures, which include proposals to limit newspaper vending machines on sidewalks and require the American flag to be flown at the front of every parade, have been met with opposition from free speech advocates.

Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, described the bills as ""ill-advised"" and ""unconstitutional."" She warned that they would have the effect of restricting speech, some commercial and some political.

Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., Democrats are defending a bill aimed at reining in Wall Street. The measure, which would establish a fund to bury the costs of dismantling failing financial institutions, has been met with resistance from Republicans who claim it would tighten credit and cost jobs.

In North Hempstead, a vote on adopting the ward system for local government has been defeated, highlighting divisions within the community over issues of representation and accountability. The outcome has sparked debate about the role of local government in addressing social and economic concerns.

As the city council continues to grapple with these issues, some candidates are rebuffed from receiving public funds due to their failure to meet fundraising thresholds. This has raised questions about the fairness of the system and its impact on smaller campaigns.

In other news, the Iraqi cabinet has approved a draft oil law, which is seen as crucial to the country's economic development

""Power Play: Politicians' Hidden Agendas Exposed""

A recent series of events has shed light on the inner workings of Washington D.C., revealing a web of deceit and manipulation by politicians. At the center of this power play are five key figures: Obama, Pelosi, Reid, Boehner, and McConnell.

These individuals have been accused of using their positions to further their own interests, often at the expense of the American people. Their actions have led to significant economic burdens on taxpayers, with some estimates suggesting that billions of dollars will be lost over the next decade.

One notable example is the recent Supreme Court decision on Medicaid expansion. While the court's ruling was seen as a victory for states' rights, critics argue that it has created a loophole that allows politicians to exploit federal funding without being held accountable.

Meanwhile, lawmakers have been accused of hypocrisy and broken promises. For instance, Senator Tester has taken millions in campaign contributions from lobbyists, despite his earlier claims of opposing such practices.

The situation is further complicated by the lack of transparency and accountability in government. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provides support to first responders, was recently blocked from coming up for a vote in Congress.

Black leaders have spoken out against these actions, with some accusing politicians of using their positions to undermine economic justice and perpetuate systemic inequality.

As the country grapples with the consequences of this power play, it is clear that something must be done to restore trust and accountability in

As we venture into the unknown, we often find ourselves drawn to the thrill of adventure and the pursuit of happiness. For some, this means embarking on a treacherous alpine climb or skiing through the Japanese mountains. Others may prefer a more leisurely pace, exploring the scenic trails of Europe or trekking through the Himalayas.

But what drives us to seek out these experiences? Is it the desire for excitement and challenge, or perhaps a deeper connection with nature? As we reflect on our own journeys, we find that it is often the simple act of being in the great outdoors that brings us a sense of fulfillment and joy.

For those who have ventured into the unknown, there are lessons to be learned about resilience and determination. A recent expedition through the boreal wilderness taught one individual the importance of adaptability and perseverance in the face of adversity. Meanwhile, another traveler discovered the value of embracing the unexpected, even when it comes to fashion choices – a 1960s suitcase proved to be a stylish yet impractical companion on a European adventure.

As we continue on our own paths, we are reminded that happiness is not just a destination, but a journey. It is a pursuit of our passions and interests, and the freedom to live life on our own terms. By embracing this mindset, we can find joy in even the most unexpected places – whether it's exploring the rugged terrain of Patagonia or simply taking a leisurely stroll through the mountains.

Ultimately, the great outdoors has a way of awakening us to new possibilities and perspectives. As we venture forth into the unknown, let us remember that happiness is not just a state of mind, but a choice we make every day – and one that can be found in even the most unexpected places.","Winter's Chill: A Season of Unpredictability

As the mercury drops, winter's grip on the region tightens. In New York City, a prolonged drought has left residents yearning for snow. The city's pavement seems to whisper tales of a bygone era, when winter's fury was more frequent and fierce.

Meanwhile, in the Catskill Mountains, hikers are finding solace in the crisp air and scenic vistas. Big Indian, a hamlet nestled along Ulster County Route 47, is home to charming inns and lodges, as well as a hip music and art scene. The Giant Ledge Trail offers breathtaking views of Panther Mountain, while the Slide Mountain hike promises panoramic vistas from its summit.

For those seeking adventure, snowshoeing has become one of winter's fastest-growing recreational sports. With its ease of use and accessibility, it's no wonder that 4.7 million Americans took to the trails in 2004 alone. The sport requires minimal equipment, making it an ideal activity for those new to winter sports.

In contrast, some ski resorts are embracing a more rugged approach. Silverton Mountain in Colorado offers lift-accessed backcountry skiing, with limited facilities and a focus on guided tours. The resort's remote location and challenging terrain make it a haven for thrill-seekers.

As the season unfolds, temperatures will continue to plummet, testing even the hardiest New Englanders. Jay Peak Ski Resort in Vermont has seen record-low temperatures, with overnight lows reaching 26 degrees below zero. Despite the chill, skiers are finding ways to enjoy the slopes, with discounts and free beverages offered to those who brave the cold.

As winter's grip tightens, residents are finding solace in the season's unpredictability. Whether it's snowshoeing, skiing, or simply taking in the scenic views, there's no denying that winter has a way of captivating our senses.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

a day in bergen headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! as regular readers will be aware, we spent a rather chilly few weeks in march 2013 travelling around europe, visiting some destinations neither of us had been to and having a lot of fun in the process. one of our missions on the trip (well, ok, so it’s a mission on every trip) was to capture some great photos of our journey for our transport partner, eurail. ostensibly pictures relating to travel of the train based variety. with this in mind vera decided that in the name of art she would forgo any kind of sensible baggage choice, opting instead to bring a suitcase from the 1960s that would look lovely in photos. which, admittedly, it did, hence it features no less than three times in our instagram round up of our european trip. unfortunately, fashion and practicality do not always go hand in hand, and after about five minutes of travel with the suitcase it became apparent that the durability of key components such as the wheels and the latches may not have been the key focus of the design team. indeed the entire structural integrity wasn’t something that had been given much thought . the lovely pink interior made up for this a little bit, although it was hard for vera to reconcile this with the various train stations and city centres she had to lug it across. and what does any of this have to do with bergen, you ask? well, bergen is

Article 6 - 6 near death experiences caught on video
avalanche skiing is a shorthand term for the act of daring god to neuter you. it consists of strapping two unconnected sticks to your legs, then falling down a mountain while trying not to do the splits. it takes balls to do that, if only because you’ve got to have some to lose on the way down. but for those who have grown truly jaded with the sport, there is extreme skiing. there are no established courses, no snow patrol to rescue you — just the sheer cliffside and two pieces of wood that you’ve strapped to your feet for some godforsaken reason. if you’re unlucky on your run, you might crash and end up cartwheeling for a few miles until inertia gets tired of messing with you. if you’re really unlucky, you might skip across some rocks on the way. if the very concept of karma has sworn a blood vendetta against you, you might get caught up in an avalanche, be crushed by thousands of tons of snow and then buried alive to die slowly from suffocation. luckily this guy was just kind of a bastard in a past life, so he miraculously survived this ordeal despite being completely buried for four and a half minutes. the audio cuts out on his helmet cam when the avalanche catches him, which is why you only hear unintelligible, high-pitched squealing after the fall (that’s his story, and he’s sticking to it). the exact second they knew they were fucked: ”this

Article 1 - the city that never sleets
i never thought i would travel for snow especially since i don't ski -- but after a brown december and a run of january days in the uncanny 60's, i fled the city for this state where winter comes with a money-back guarantee. by now the temperature in new york has finally dipped below freezing, but that's hardly a proper, hood-up cold wave. and 10 months without a flurry makes the very pavement seem doleful. i can't take solace in memories of last winter's accumulation, which was so meager that i never even got to wear my l. l. bean boots. they sat in the closet like a totem of some long extinguished culture, practically a work of folk art, evoking the sadness i associate with global warming. it's a feeling that can't be grasped except in small things: odd funguses on familiar trees, celestial colors that rightly belong in adobe photoshop, and a permanently stuffed nose in winter -- my allergy clock gone haywire. worse than the serial sneezing is the chronic sensation that the world i know is missing from the world i see. i realize it will snow eventually. this has been a dry winter; others will be moist enough for ''snain,'' at least. but 8 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred in the past decade. at this rate, the white christmas could become a figment of fifth avenue shop windows and holiday specials with kathie

Article 2 - long underwear and other cool gifts
this being my annual snow sports gear and gadgets guide for the holidays, i realize i must recommend more than long underwear. so here are some other gift suggestions for the winter sports enthusiast: goggles are a personal statement these days, not just something to keep snow out of your eyes. if you don’t believe me, check out the dragon hypno series goggles ($130; www.dragonalliance.com). you’ll see well, and with the neon yellow, red or green zebra strips strapped around your head, everyone else on the mountain will see you coming. another popular goggle model is the shred nastify ($99; www.buyshred.com), a goggle marketed to snowboarders and skiers. the young, charismatic and unconventional olympic ski racing champion ted ligety designed the goggles. because of their advanced helmet safety engineering, poc-brand helmets continue to be one of the hottest sellers in what is, thankfully, an expanding sector of the ski and snowboard market. poc, a swedish company, has designed a helmet for free riders — the poc skull light xp ($150; www.backcountry.com) with a semi-hard shell and removable earflaps for warmer days in the park or pipe. the k2 moxie helmet ($120; www.k2skis.com), which directs users to several sites that sell; for example, it was $120 at al’s ski barn) was designed with a woman’s mind in mind. or at least the shape

Article 3 - spring breaks; hiking the catskills
hiking buffs headed for the catskills need no introduction to big indian, n.y., with its soaring mountains and many wide-ranging trails. but the hamlet, nestled along ulster county route 47, is also home to a little-known smattering of charming inns and lodges -- not to mention a hip little resort with an emerging music and art scene. by morning, try your hand at giant ledge trail, a moderate two-hour hike leading to a long ridge along panther mountain. the trip up is half the fun -- looking for plant fossils in the rocks underfoot or ducking into the shallow caves peppered throughout -- but the ledge itself offers one of the most spectacular vistas in the area. at the top, keep watch for a natural couch made entirely of sandstone -- the perfect spot to take a load off, or better yet, take some lunch in. if you're feeling frisky enough for round 2, the relatively gentle slog up to slide mountain is easy but breathtaking; it leads to the highest peak in the catskills, at a whopping 4,180 feet. spring thaw makes the river crossings tough, but hikers who reach the top are rewarded with a view of at least 70 peaks, from the shawangunks to the taconics. peak baggers, however, will want to keep moving. the hike down slide and over to cornell mountain (that's two peaks in the bag) is extremely challenging but promises even better views

Article 4 - physical culture/gear test with david felkley, showshoe guide; in stride, with snowshoes
why is snowshoeing is one of winter's fastest-growing recreational sports? ''because it's easy,'' said claire walter, author of ''the snowshoe experience,'' (workman, 2004). ''if you can walk, you can showshoe,'' she said. ''the joke is that it's a 12-step program -- take 12 steps, and you are a snowshoer.'' some 4.7 million americans clamped on snowshoes at least once in 2004, nearly 2 million more than in 1998, when the outdoor industry association, which follows leisure trends, began tracking the sport. the snowshoe is a lightweight platform with crampons on the bottom and a binding system on top that attaches to a shoe or boot, ideally a waterproof hiking boot or a trail-running sneaker, ms. walter said. generally the heavier the person and the more powdery the snow, the bigger the ideal snowshoe, but ''22 to 25 inches long by 8 or 9 inches wide is the golden mean for size,'' ms. walter said. women-specific snowshoes are generally narrower. beginners, she said, may also want to use poles to help with balance. david felkley, 66, the co-author of ''snowshoeing'' (mountaineers books, 2002), has been leading snowshoeing tours in colorado for two decades

walk into badrutt’s palace — the five-star hotel named for the mid-19th-century founder of st. moritz tourism — in that luscious ski resort time frame known as “après ski,” especially during the annual gourmet festival’s chocolate or caviar tastings, and you’ll see the furs strewn haphazardly, casually, across the backs of velvet divans or nestled like pets beside their owners, bags from la perla at the owners’ feet. furless, in your 10-year-old ems jacket, you’re an obvious outsider. your chanel, dolce & gabbana or gucci sunglasses — preferably this season’s please, with a large label or signifier on the sidepiece — are insufficient. there are those who say the fabulousness quotient is much lower than it was a half-century ago. “the fur you see now,” says gaby stein, a belgian boutique owner with the rows of diamonds ringing her neck reminiscent of those a best-actress contender might borrow for the oscars. “that’s nothing. you used to bring three fur coats to change off. the furs would be tossed aside on the floor of the king’s club.” st. moritz may have changed, but the king’s club, owned by badrutt’s palace, is still known as a celebrity haunt. claudia schiffer, liz hurley, kate moss, robert de niro

Article 7 - where icebergs are born
scandinavians fly from copenhagen on direct greenlandair flights to narsarsuaq or kangerlussuaq, the island's air hub, or on daily sas flights to kangerlussuaq, and then fly north to ilulissat, to watch icebergs calve from glaciers. every summer, ilulissat kangerlua, a fjord two miles south of ilulissat, presents the spectacle of the world's largest concentration of icebergs outside of antarctica. from a three-mile-wide glacier, 20 million tons of ice break off each day -- some into pieces as large as city blocks. to the south of nuuk, the area around narsarsuaq offers viking ruins, including the preserved 1,000-year-old remains of brattahlid, the hillside farm of eric the red, the norwegian who led colonization of greenland, in 986. at their peak, the viking colonies probably numbered about 3,000 people, enough to prompt the vatican to appoint bishops regularly for about 200 years. but in the mid-1300's, the norse started abandoning their colonies around nuuk, retreating southward. the last written trace of the norse in greenland was an icelandic record of a greenland marriage in 1408. archaeologists now believe that the last viking colonies in greenland were abandoned around 145

Article 9 - adventure -- seeking thrills, from the ski trails of europe to the backcountry of british columbia to the wilds of botsw
closer to home, the buzz in the north american ski community involves an area with no running water, no grooming machines and no attitude. silverton mountain, in southwest colorado, is a rarity in north america: a marriage of lift access and unsullied backcountry skiing. a sole chairlift rises to a 13,000-foot ridgeline. once there, skiers find a cyclorama of snag-tooth peaks, lots of powder - and little else. no cut runs. no grooming. no easy way down the powder-filled chutes and claustrophobic glades plummeting 2,000 feet to the old sunnyside mine. hiking above the lift opens up still more terrain, like billboard, a fall-line sluice that cascades 2,800 feet to an access road, where a shuttle bus returns skiers to the base area. the only other facilities are a tent with no faucets but flowing beer, a wood-burning stove and rental counter. at night, folks drive back down the box canyon to silverton, a nearly dead mining town resuscitated in part by folks coming to ski this oddity. the san juans harbor some of the most dangerous avalanche conditions in the nation, so the federal bureau of land management, which issues the operating permit for silverton mountain, has limited the number of skiers to 80 a day. all must be accompanied by guides (total cost is $119 a day) and carry avalanche

Article 10 - even the hardiest new englanders are left cold
at jay peak ski resort just south of the canadian border in vermont, where overnight lows on tuesday plummeted to 26 degrees below zero, traffic on the slopes was thin and a couple of lifts were shut down because managers were worried that the equipment would freeze and break. ''we have definitely experienced low skier attendance this week, and probably will over the next few days,'' said zoe holt, a spokeswoman for the resort. but ms. holt said skiers who braved the subzero temperatures would get a $20 discount off a $54 lift ticket and a free beverage -- a hot one, of course. ''people can certainly come up and ski tomorrow and have a nice day, as long as their exposed skin is covered,'' she said. records were broken in burlington, vt., where the previous low temperature was 4 degrees below zero in 1988, said brooke taber, a meteorologist with the national weather service. as of 5 p.m. wednesday, mr. taber said, ''it's at minus 8 and falling.'' the upstate new york towns gouverneur and watertown had overnight temperatures tuesday more than 30 degrees below zero, mr. taber said. on mount washington in new hampshire, the temperatures were the lowest in the region -- 44 degrees below zero, and feeling like 100 degrees below with the wind chill factor.

""Exploring the Great Outdoors: A Journey of Discovery""

As we venture into the unknown, we often find ourselves drawn to the thrill of adventure and the pursuit of happiness. For some, this means embarking on a treacherous alpine climb or skiing through the Japanese mountains. Others may prefer a more leisurely pace, exploring the scenic trails of Europe or trekking through the Himalayas.

But what drives us to seek out these experiences? Is it the desire for excitement and challenge, or perhaps a deeper connection with nature? As we reflect on our own journeys, we find that it is often the simple act of being in the great outdoors that brings us a sense of fulfillment and joy.

For those who have ventured into the unknown, there are lessons to be learned about resilience and determination. A recent expedition through the boreal wilderness taught one individual the importance of adaptability and perseverance in the face of adversity. Meanwhile, another traveler discovered the value of embracing the unexpected, even when it comes to fashion choices – a 1960s suitcase proved to be a stylish yet impractical companion on a European adventure.

As we continue on our own paths, we are reminded that happiness is not just a destination, but a journey. It is a pursuit of our passions and interests, and the freedom to live life on our own terms. By embracing this mindset, we can find joy in even the most unexpected places – whether it's exploring the rugged terrain of Patagonia or simply taking a

Winter's Chill: A Season of Unpredictability

As the mercury drops, winter's grip on the region tightens. In New York City, a prolonged drought has left residents yearning for snow. The city's pavement seems to whisper tales of a bygone era, when winter's fury was more frequent and fierce.

Meanwhile, in the Catskill Mountains, hikers are finding solace in the crisp air and scenic vistas. Big Indian, a hamlet nestled along Ulster County Route 47, is home to charming inns and lodges, as well as a hip music and art scene. The Giant Ledge Trail offers breathtaking views of Panther Mountain, while the Slide Mountain hike promises panoramic vistas from its summit.

For those seeking adventure, snowshoeing has become one of winter's fastest-growing recreational sports. With its ease of use and accessibility, it's no wonder that 4.7 million Americans took to the trails in 2004 alone. The sport requires minimal equipment, making it an ideal activity for those new to winter sports.

In contrast, some ski resorts are embracing a more rugged approach. Silverton Mountain in Colorado offers lift-accessed backcountry skiing, with limited facilities and a focus on guided tours. The resort's remote location and challenging terrain make it a haven for thrill-seekers.

As the season unfolds, temperatures will continue to plummet, testing even the hardiest New Englanders. Jay Peak Ski Resort in Vermont has seen record-low temperatures, with

A wave of historic proportions is sweeping across the United States, with significant implications for the country's politics. In Virginia, a bloodletting of the Republican Party has been witnessed, with the party facing a wipeout in the state legislature.

Meanwhile, in Illinois, the Republican Party has been criticized for its lack of support for conservative candidate Paul McKinley, who is now declared the official nominee. The party's silence on McKinley's campaign has been seen as a missed opportunity to capitalize on his surge in popularity.

In other parts of the country, independent candidates are emerging as a force to be reckoned with. In Missouri, an independent candidate has announced plans to run for Congress, citing dissatisfaction with the way Republicans have governed and the current Democratic Congress.

The shift towards independence is also being seen in Virginia, where Republican Senatorial candidate Siobhan Stolle Dunnavant has denied meeting with Democrats to discuss a potential run for office. The incident has raised questions about the party's ability to control its own candidates.

As the US politics landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the traditional parties are facing significant challenges from within and outside their ranks. With the rise of independent candidates and the growing dissatisfaction with both parties, it remains to be seen how this shift will play out in the coming years.","New Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey has emerged as a surprise choice for the state's speaker of the assembly, despite his party's internal divisions and lingering questions about corruption in the police department.

McGreevey's selection was seen as a compromise between Democrats, who had initially backed Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., and minority leader Joseph V. Doria Jr. The decision has sparked debate within the Democratic Party, with some questioning whether McGreevey is truly committed to reforming the party's image.

Meanwhile, in Washington, several high-profile senators are facing changes in their roles and responsibilities. Senator Trent Lott, the former Senate Majority Leader, will be giving up his elegantly appointed second-floor suite to new leader Bill Frist. Other senior senators, including Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Robert C. Byrd, are also being displaced.

In New York, Donald Trump's organization has a significant presence in the city, with several high-profile properties and a visible brand name. However, despite his claims of being a force to be reckoned with in the city, Trump's real estate holdings in New York are modest, and he does not belong to key trade groups.

In other news, a gubernatorial candidate in Virginia has been gaining attention for his centrist views and ability to appeal to independents. His popularity is seen as a potential deciding factor in the state's upcoming election.

Connecticut has also been making headlines with its liberal leanings, passing laws such as civil unions and stem-cell research financing. The state's campaign finance law, which limits contributions to political candidates, has also drawn attention from national observers.

As the presidential season approaches, several states are expected to play a key role in the election. New Hampshire, in particular, is seen as a crucial swing state, with its four electoral votes potentially making all the difference in the outcome of the election.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

breaking: historic democrat wave wiping out virginia gop % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the polls have closed in virginia, and what we’re seeing is a bloodletting of the republican party of a kind unseen in a generation. republican candidate for virginia governor ed gillespie pauses while speaking with reporters after voting at his polling place tuesday, nov. 7, 2017, in alexandria, va. gillespie faces democrat lt. gov. ralph northam in tuesday’s election. (ap photo/alex brandon) ed gillespie and the virginia gop needed the polls to be wrong, but the polls were right. gillespie needed loudoun county be virginia’s next governor, as governor bob mcdonnell did, and as president george w. bush did. as of this writing he’s down 60-40 there. ditto prince william county. but that’s not the worst of it. the way the returns are coming in, it’s a complete wipe out for the republican party. the republicans have held the house of delegates since the 1999 election completed the post-1994 conversion of the state to being a republican state. republicans won a 66-34 supermajority in the body after the 2015 election. as of now, they’re looking set to lose it. according to decision desk

Article 4 - iowa, minnesota, and the anomalous zone on the u.s. electoral map
iowa, minnesota, and the anomalous zone on the u.s. electoral map (before it's news) in recent u.s. presidential elections, rural counties have tended to vote heavily for the republican candidates. as a result, most of the united states is shaded red on county-level electoral maps. most of the low-population counties that do support democratic candidates fall into one of several categories. in some cases the explanation is clearly demographic; the heavily african-american belt stretching from southeastern virginia to western mississippi, the heavily hispanic areas of northern new mexico and southern texas, and the scattered native american counties in the northern great plains and the southwest have long been democratic strongholds. location also plays a role, as rural counties in new england and on the pacific coast that are closely connected with nearby metropolitan areas also tend to support democrats. most of the other seemingly anomalous blue rural counties can usually be explained by their specific characteristics, such as the presence of a major ski resort (blaine county, idaho), a local economy based (or recently based) on unionized mining (silver bow county, montana), or the existence of a large college (athens county, ohio). one large block of largely rural, democratic-voting territory, however, does not fit into any of these categories. in what might be called the “upper mississippi river valley anomaly,” one finds a substantial cluster of mostly agricultural, deeply religious, heavily caucasian “blue

gop on verge of legislative clean sweep in the south? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the 2010 elections and their aftermath saw much of the remaining state-level power of southern democrats evaporate. prior to this, they held roughly half of the southern legislative chambers, but the gop took control of nearly half of those chambers : the houses and senates in alabama and north carolina on election night, and the louisiana house shortly afterwards, leaving the democrats in charge of just seven out of 26 legislative chambers from austin to richmond. ongoing wave of party-switches across the south is allowing the gop to consolidate its gains and further erode what little power the democrats still have in the south. since election day, the bleeding hasn’t stopped for democrats, as anstill have in the south. republicans made considerable gains in every southern state which held legislative elections this fall, gaining 163 seats. by contrast, in the seven southern legislative chambers which the democrats still hold, their collective majority is just 37 seats, with the gop cutting those majorities nearly in half by gaining a total of 30 seats in those chambers in last month’s elections: arkansas house and senate: republicans surged last month, going 28 to 44 seats in the 100 member house (+16 seats) and from 8 to 15 (+7 seats) in the 35 member senate. to take

they note that mr. barnes has built an enviable record on resonant issues like education and regulating urban growth. he won national notice by orchestrating a stealthy compromise that minimized the confederate battle emblem that had dominated the state flag. polls show that he is popular at home, and that he appeals to independents and african-americans. the potential democratic field is thick with washington insiders. it makes sense, mr. barnes's partisans say, that a governor or two will join the competition. the governor once considered the most likely choice, gray davis of california, has been roughed up by his state's energy crisis. mr. barnes leads the next most-populous state with a democratic governor. and the democrats have an affinity for centrist southerners. a candidate's ability to capture a significant southern state like georgia could be decisive. ''i would say he's the leading democratic governor in the region that democrats have got to win to carry the white house,'' said david worley, georgia's democratic chairman. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. dane strother, a

Article 4 - the odd couple
the two are on a roll. they're entertaining. they're informative. they are a-list invitees, on the speed dial of the current governor, james e. mcgreevey. in addition, they have a regular column that appears in the star-ledger. they are, in short, the antidote to two grumpy old men. and they could not have come from more diverse backgrounds. mr. kean, who is 67, is a moderate republican from far hills, and the 78-year-old mr. byrne is a scrappy irish-american democrat from west orange -- yet they act and move almost as brothers. true, both graduated from princeton, the state's premier university. but while mr. byrne financed his education through the g.i. bill after serving in the army air corps in world war ii, mr. kean of the broad vowels was the product of a family steeped in wealth and politics, and four years at princeton was a natural progression. after all, his grandfather had served in the united states senate, and his father was a member of the house of representatives for 20 years. as for mr. byrne, his family was involved in politics on the local level -- his father was the police and fire commissioner in west orange and his grandfather was an alderman -- but none of the land his family had owned was a gift from the king of england, a boast that mr. kean could make.

Article 5 - turning g.o.p. upside down
with his legislative partner gone, mr. gaffney removed himself from the political maelstrom by announcing that he would not seek re-election this year, but his decision only further stokes the chaos, as different factions maneuver to make their candidate the next republican nominee for county executive. ''when the two largest republican leaders step down, it's probably an 8.6 on the political richter scale,'' said richard h. schaffer, chairman of the suffolk democrats. he added that the departures of two longtime republican officials naturally give democrats hope of gaining more ground. while the republicans in the two counties face different challenges, mr. schaffer said, ''what they have in common is their members know they just can't run as republicans and get elected anymore.'' ''it used to be you could nominate just about anybody and get elected as long as you were republican,'' he added, ''but now they're seeing that democrats are forcing them to have to compete in both counties.'' mr. mondello conceded the point. ''these are different times now,'' he said. ''you've got to work now as a nassau republican.'' both mr. guardino and mr. gaffney cited their long tenures as part of their reasons for choosing to move on. mr. guardino, 52, has served as a town official in hempstead since 1981, first as a council member, and as supervisor since 1998. mr

Article 6 - donald trump in new york: deep roots, but little influence
donald trump in new york: deep roots, but little influence image donald j. trump’s organization manages the wollman ice skating rink in central park. credit edward caruso for the new york times it is impossible to miss when you fly into new york city and spot the golf course in the shadow of the whitestone bridge. it is hard to avoid when you stroll along fifth avenue, or venture past the skating rink or carousel in central park. and it is there in bright lights, no less, when you pass the sleek hotel near the entrance to the holland tunnel: the name of donald j. trump. mr. trump has embraced his roots as a new yorker as being crucial to his presidential bid, and in so doing, the republican candidate has given the impression as he crossed the country that he is a force to reckon with in the city of his birth. but while trump remains a visible brand name around the city’s five boroughs, it is much harder to discern his imprint as a classic power broker, someone who is feared and can make things happen with a phone call or a quiet aside with the right person at the right time. his real estate holdings in new york are modest; he did not make the top 10 in lists of major condominium developers and power players in real estate in the city, as judged by several publications. he does not belong to trade groups like the real estate board of new york or the association for a better new york.

Article 7 - deals, debts and the choice for speaker in new jersey
few people seem more stunned by his sudden rise than mr. sires himself. ''i was very surprised,'' he said during an interview last week. mr. sires (pronounced seer-es) would seem an unlikely choice for speaker. to begin with, he is an inexperienced legislator, having served just two years in the assembly and having sponsored only 19 bills. he is also not very close to the governor-elect. in 1997, mr. sires opposed mr. mcgreevey, supporting gov. christie whitman, a republican, for re-election. more recently, he backed senator robert g. torricelli when mr. torricelli fought mr. mcgreevey for the democratic nomination for governor. there are lingering questions about exactly what mr. sires knew about the corruption in the police department. ultimately, 30 people, including the longtime chief, were convicted or pleaded guilty in connection with bribery, gambling and prostitution. mr. sires, who was not charged, said that he helped clean up the mess and that the extent of the corruption came as a shock. despite all this, he emerged as mr. mcgreevey's solution to a bitter fight among democrats for the speakership that put joseph v. doria jr., the current assembly minority leader, against assemblyman joseph j. roberts jr. of camden. mr. doria, who is also the mayor of bayonne, had expected to become speaker.

Article 8 - where four electoral votes could loom large again
but a statewide poll by the university of new hampshire survey center, released the week before the democratic national convention last month, showed mr. kerry slightly ahead of mr. bush, 47 percent to 43 percent, though his lead was still within the margin of error. another 4 percent favored ralph nader, and 6 percent were undecided. the race is so close that the months before the november election may be as lively here as the presidential primaries that put new hampshire in the political spotlight every four years. both campaigns say they plan to go all out here. in 2000, al gore's presidential campaign wrote off new hampshire early as a lost cause and devoted few resources here. the decision may have cost mr. gore the election. mr. bush, whose campaign was much more active, defeated mr. gore by only 7,211 votes out of nearly 570,000 votes cast. new hampshire was the only east coast state north of virginia that mr. gore lost. if he had won here, the state's measly four electoral votes would have made him president. ''new hampshire is predominantly a republican state,'' said andrew e. smith, director of the survey center. ''all our statewide offices are held by republicans. the senate and house are 75 percent republican. but republicans here are a different breed from those in washington. they're what used to be called rockefeller republicans.''

Article 9 - presidential! season! soonish!
“i felt bad for dorothy, but it was a million bucks for the democratic party ,” mcauliffe said in his autobiography. honestly, it was a miracle anybody in virginia showed up to vote. i did like cuccinelli’s breakout attack theme: “all puppy and no plan.” let’s hope that one resurfaces during the presidential race. which is just around the corner, presuming the corner lasts for 26 months. presidential! that brings us back to chris christie, the man of the hour. even though he’s a republican in a deep blue state, he won a huge victory against — um, the democrat. who was ... named ... barbara buono. photo buono was battling odds that made the alamo look like a quick game of parcheesi. she’s a 20-year veteran of the state legislature, a résumé that always inspires excitement among the electorate. she had about a quarter of christie’s budget for ads. nobody from the clinton family went to new jersey to campaign for her. some days, it seemed as if nobody from new jersey was showing up, either. “the democratic political bosses ... made a deal with this governor, despite him representing almost everything they’re against. they didn’t do it for the state. they did it to help themselves politically and financially,” buono said on election night, in a speech that centered on the terribleness of her own state party. in

Article 10 - a laboratory for liberals?
but is the land of steady habits really ready for the cutting edge? even more than that, is connecticut becoming a liberal bellwether? if 2005 was any indication, it could be. this year, the legislature passed a law permitting civil unions, becoming the first state to offer gay unions without being pressured by the courts. unlike in other states, where gay rights groups see civil unions as a long shot, groups in connecticut were so uninspired by the civil unions bill that they initially opposed it, pushing for full marriage rights or nothing at all. while the federal estate tax has been whittled away in recent years, the connecticut legislature reimposed its own estate tax this year. it also passed a law financing stem-cell research, despite widespread disputes over such research in other states and in the federal government. liberal groups were delighted when the state sued the federal government over the requirements of the no child left behind act. and recently senator joseph i. lieberman has been under attack in the state for his hawkish views on the iraq war. in the past few weeks, a web site was set up with the sole purpose of getting former gov. lowell weicker to challenge mr. lieberman on an antiwar platform, a prospect that has many in the state's left-wing circles positively giddy. then there is the campaign finance law, which strictly limits contributions to political candidates and establishes public financing of campaigns. taking interest-group money out of politics is not

Historic Shifts in US Politics

A wave of historic proportions is sweeping across the United States, with significant implications for the country's politics. In Virginia, a bloodletting of the Republican Party has been witnessed, with the party facing a wipeout in the state legislature.

Meanwhile, in Illinois, the Republican Party has been criticized for its lack of support for conservative candidate Paul McKinley, who is now declared the official nominee. The party's silence on McKinley's campaign has been seen as a missed opportunity to capitalize on his surge in popularity.

In other parts of the country, independent candidates are emerging as a force to be reckoned with. In Missouri, an independent candidate has announced plans to run for Congress, citing dissatisfaction with the way Republicans have governed and the current Democratic Congress.

The shift towards independence is also being seen in Virginia, where Republican Senatorial candidate Siobhan Stolle Dunnavant has denied meeting with Democrats to discuss a potential run for office. The incident has raised questions about the party's ability to control its own candidates.

As the US politics landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the traditional parties are facing significant challenges from within and outside their ranks. With the rise of independent candidates and the growing dissatisfaction with both parties, it remains to be seen how this shift will play out in the coming years.

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE
---------------------
New Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey has emerged as a surprise choice for the state's speaker of the assembly, despite his party's internal divisions and lingering questions about corruption in the police department.

McGreevey's selection was seen as a compromise between Democrats, who had initially backed Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., and minority leader Joseph V. Doria Jr. The decision has sparked debate within the Democratic Party, with some questioning whether McGreevey is truly committed to reforming the party's image.

Meanwhile, in Washington, several high-profile senators are facing changes in their roles and responsibilities. Senator Trent Lott, the former Senate Majority Leader, will be giving up his elegantly appointed second-floor suite to new leader Bill Frist. Other senior senators, including Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Robert C. Byrd, are also being displaced.

In New York, Donald Trump's organization has a significant presence in the city, with several high-profile properties and a visible brand name. However, despite his claims of being a force to be reckoned with in the city, Trump's real estate holdings in New York are modest, and he does not belong to key trade groups.

In other news, a gubernatorial candidate in Virginia has been gaining attention for his centrist views and ability to appeal to independents. His popularity is seen as a potential deciding factor in the state's upcoming election.

Connecticut has also been making headlines with its liberal leanings, passing laws such as

Additionally, it mentions a court order to close the foundation, which is consistent with the events described in the original article.  The style and content of this article are also similar to the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, as it reports on specific news events and provides context about the Russian government's actions. The language used is objective and factual, without any sensational or biased tone that is often characteristic of FAKE NEWS articles.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Global Economic Shifts and Geopolitical Tensions"" lacks specificity and concrete details, instead focusing on general themes and speculations about global events. It also uses more vague language and makes unsubstantiated claims, which are red flags for FAKE NEWS.","Global Economic Shifts and Geopolitical Tensions

A recent series of events has highlighted the complex interplay between global economic shifts, geopolitical tensions, and the actions of influential individuals. The World Economic Forum in Davos saw Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev present Russia's investment case to a global audience, sparking questions about the country's ability to attract foreign capital.

Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the influence of private corporations on international relations. A recent investigation has revealed that certain companies, including those with ties to the Rothschild family, may be seeking to destabilize global stability by fueling tensions between nations.

The Middle East has also become a focal point for these tensions, as Russia's military intervention in Syria continues to shape the region's dynamics. The conflict has drawn in various actors, including Western powers and regional players, each with their own agendas and interests.

In addition, there have been reports of unusual transactions and financial maneuvers, which some analysts believe may be linked to efforts to manipulate global markets or exert influence over key industries. These developments have raised concerns about the potential for economic instability and conflict.

As the world navigates these complex challenges, it is essential to consider the role of influential individuals and organizations in shaping global events. By examining the intersections between economics, geopolitics, and power dynamics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play and work towards more informed decision-making.","Moscow Court Cracks Down on Opposition Figure's Foundation

A Moscow court has ordered the closure of a foundation supporting opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, citing a case filed by the Justice Ministry. The foundation, which has received over $4.9 million in donations from more than 145,000 Russians, was used to finance campaign materials and salaries for Navalny's team across 84 regions.

The move comes after Navalny announced plans to boycott the upcoming presidential election, sparking a series of rallies in over 90 cities and towns. The court order is seen as an attempt to silence Navalny's growing movement against corruption and the Kremlin's rule under President Vladimir Putin.

Meanwhile, in other news, the US is investigating a Moscow theater siege that may be linked to Al-Qaeda. Analysts say the investigation could pose diplomatic complications at a time when the US is strengthening its cooperation with Russia on law enforcement and counterterrorism.

In related developments, a Dutch court has overturned a $50 billion ruling against Russia in a long-standing case involving Yukos oil company. The Russian government has welcomed the decision, which it claims proves that Yukos engaged in massive tax fraud throughout its existence.

The US is also concerned about Russia's potential sale of advanced air defense systems to Syria, which could limit the ability of Western nations to operate over Syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone. The move has raised concerns among diplomats and intelligence officials.

In other news, a study by Colombian economists has found that most profits from drug trafficking in Colombia are laundered through banks in global financial centers like New York and London. The report highlights the need for greater transparency and cooperation to combat money laundering.

As tensions between Russia and the West continue to rise, it remains to be seen how these developments will play out in the coming months.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

russia, syria and the camp of resistance in the middle east (before it's news) on sept. 30, 2015, russian planes began conducting airstrikes against rebel targets in syria at the request of president bashar al-assad. this military intervention signaled a new chapter in the five-year war in syria, which has pitted the country’s national democratic government against foreign-backed rebel groups. launched for the stated purpose of defeating the growing islamic state (is) insurgency, russia’s operations have also targeted u.s.-backed reactionary rebel groups. for those forces resisting imperialism in the middle east, the outcome of the war in syria is of critical importance. russian air support has significantly bolstered the position of the syrian government. and while national self-interest, not solidarity, drives russian intervention in syria, it has the effect of strengthening the camp of resistance to imperialism in the region. war in syria and the camp of resistance in 2011, neoliberal economic policies pushed by global financial institutions like the world bank and imf contributed to a wave of mass protests in countries across the middle east and north africa. after protests in tunisia and egypt brought down two u.s.-backed regimes, the western imperialist powers leveraged this political unrest to destabilize libya and syria’s national democratic governments. both libya and syria proved too strong for the imperialist-backed opposition to topple alone. in libya, it took

photo moscow — a moscow court on monday ordered the closing of a foundation supporting the activities of aleksei a. navalny, the country’s leading opposition politician, moving quickly in a case filed only this month by the justice ministry. the court order came before a series of rallies in more than 90 russian cities and towns, scheduled for sunday and organized by mr. navalny and his supporters. the foundation, the fifth season of the year, has been used by mr. navalny to collect donations that finance campaign materials, salaries and offices in 84 regions across russia, among other weapons in his drive against corruption and the workings of the kremlin under president vladimir v. putin. more than 145,000 russians have donated $4.9 million to the foundation over the past 13 months, mr. navalny says. at the end of december, russian election officials barred mr. navalny from running in the presidential election scheduled for march, citing his suspended sentence in a fraud case that he and his supporters have denounced as politically motivated. advertisement continue reading the main story in response, mr. navalny announced that he would turn his candidacy into a campaign for a boycott of the presidential election, and he called on his followers to take part in street protests. that, he added, was what led to the court case against his foundation.

Article 2 - u.s. investigates moscow theater siege, seeking qaeda link
in any case, analysts said the americans' interest in the sensitive issue -- and the fact that ms. gubareva was brought to the united states by a foundation financed by a fierce critic of the russian president -- could pose diplomatic complications at a time when the united states has moved to strengthen its cooperation with russia in law enforcement and counterterrorism. the previously undisclosed investigation is an outgrowth of a broader inquiry into possible terrorist ties between al qaeda and chechen rebels, according to a senior f.b.i. official. the theater takeover ''is a piece of the overall puzzle,'' the official said. ''we're trying to determine what the network that funded and authorized the attack was, and we want to see if that road takes us to al qaeda. we're certainly very interested in establishing that link, but we're not there yet.'' the russians have long argued that qaeda operatives have used the separatist struggle in chechnya as a breeding ground for terrorism by financing and organizing violent attacks there. although some western officials have previously played down that assertion, the f.b.i. has been intensifying efforts to investigate financial and logistical links between the two groups. almost all of the dozens of chechen rebels inside the theater -- including women with explosives-lined belts strapped across their chadors -- were reported killed, and the russia government has said nothing about any surviving rebels. it is uncertain whether any plotters are still alive. but ms. gubareva said

Article 3 - dutch court overturns $50 billion ruling against russia in yukos case
paying out $50 billion would be a strain for russia, which has fallen into recession because of low oil prices and western sanctions. russia had revenue of $130 billion from oil exports last year, but the plunge in prices since mid-2014 means the country might make even less from petroleum this year. the russian government voiced pleasure over the ruling on wednesday. “if these men continue to try to exploit the international courts to take money from the russian people, we will show yukos engaged in massive tax fraud throughout its existence, and fight them in every court and every jurisdiction,” said andrey kondakov, director general of the international center for legal protection, which the russian government set up to fight the case. the arbitration panel that ruled against russia in 2014 had met in the hague and had been chosen jointly by yukos and the russian federation. that is why the appeal was heard by the dutch district court that ruled on wednesday. its decision, in turn, could be appealed to higher dutch courts. gml is pursuing legal efforts to collect the russian money in a half-dozen other countries: belgium, britain, france, germany, india and the united states. there have not yet been rulings in those cases, and it was not immediately clear on wednesday how the decision in the hague might affect them. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid

Article 4 - uk government right to refuse release of secret documents - high court | uk news
the government can keep secret “super-sensitive” documents from britain’s spy agencies that might shed light on the mystery death of a fugitive russian, the high court has ruled. justice cranston upheld an application by the home secretary, amber rudd, who is refusing to release documents from mi5 and mi6 concerning alexander perepilichnyy, who collapsed and died in november 2012 outside his home in weybridge, surrey. surrey police have said there was nothing suspicious about the death of the 44-year-old, who had been out jogging. they were unable to find a cause. however, in 2015 it emerged that traces of a rare and deadly plant poison , gelsemium elegans , were found in perepilichnyy’s stomach. the poison has been used by russian and chinese assassins, a hearing was told. the judge said he could not see “cogent or solid reasons” for rejecting the government’s application for “public interest immunity” or pii. he said he agreed with the home secretary’s view that disclosing the intelligence files would cause “real and significant damage to national security”. cranston added that the position of the coroner, richard travers, who had brought the application to see the secret evidence was “now untenable”. but the government had refused, merely showing him a “gist” or vague summary of its contents. the ruling comes after an unusual one-day hearing at the high

Article 5 - police tied to murder of russian journalist
in a news conference and a subsequent telephone interview, joel simon, the executive director of the committee to protect journalists, said an official at russia’s foreign ministry told a delegation from the committee that prosecutors were investigating whether police officials were involved in the murder. mr. simon said it was not clear from the official’s statement whether the police officials being investigated were chechen or russian. the russian and chechen governments reacted quickly. the foreign ministry released a statement saying that the committee’s statement “did not correspond with the facts.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. ramzan kadyrov, the young former rebel who is now the pro-kremlin chechen premier, vigorously denied that chechen police officials had been involved. “anna politkovskaya was a journalist, a person in a peaceful profession, and chechen policemen are not fighting peaceful people,” he said, according to interfax. “their goal is to fight terrorists.” mr. kadyrov, who has commanded paramilitary formations of former rebels, has often been accused of brutality and criminality and has been called a suspect in the death of ms

Article 8 - u.s. fears russia may sell air-defense system to syria
washington — the united states, which is trying to bring syrian rebels and the syrian government to the negotiating table, is now increasingly worried that russia plans to sell a sophisticated air defense system to syria, american officials said wednesday. russia has a long history of selling arms to the syrians and has a naval base in the country. but the delivery of the russian s-300 missile batteries would represent a major qualitative advancement in syria’s air defenses. the system is regarded as highly effective and would limit the ability of the united states and other nations to operate over syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone. it is also able to track and fire missiles at multiple targets, including aircraft and some missiles. “there are concerns that this might happen,” said a senior united states official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to the possible delivery of the s-300. a western intelligence service has also warned that the russians may soon send s-300 air defense batteries to syria, said another american official who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports. advertisement continue reading the main story news of the possible russian sale, which was first reported online by the wall street journal on wednesday evening, came less than a day after secretary of state john kerry sought to enlist russia’s help in facilitating a political transition that would supplant president bashar al-assad of syria.

Article 9 - where the mob keeps its money
a study last year by the colombian economists alejandro gaviria and daniel mejía concluded that the vast majority of profits from drug trafficking in colombia were reaped by criminal syndicates in rich countries and laundered by banks in global financial centers like new york and london. they found that bank secrecy and privacy laws in western countries often impeded transparency and made it easier for criminals to launder their money. at a congressional hearing in february, jennifer shasky calvery, a justice department official in charge of monitoring money laundering, said that “banks in the u.s. are used to funnel massive amounts of illicit funds.” the laundering, she explained, typically occurs in three stages. first, illicit funds are directly deposited in banks or deposited after being smuggled out of the united states and then back in. then comes “layering,” the process of separating criminal profits from their origin. finally comes “integration,” the use of seemingly legitimate transactions to hide ill-gotten gains. unfortunately, investigators too often focus on the cultivation, production and trafficking of narcotics while missing the bigger, more sophisticated financial activities of crime rings. mob financing via banks has ebbed and flowed over the years. in the late 1970s and early 1980s organized crime, which had previously dealt mainly in cash, started working its way into the banking system. this led authorities in europe and america to take measures to slow international money laundering, prompting a temporary return to cash. then the

Moscow Court Cracks Down on Opposition Figure's Foundation

A Moscow court has ordered the closure of a foundation supporting opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, citing a case filed by the Justice Ministry. The foundation, which has received over $4.9 million in donations from more than 145,000 Russians, was used to finance campaign materials and salaries for Navalny's team across 84 regions.

The move comes after Navalny announced plans to boycott the upcoming presidential election, sparking a series of rallies in over 90 cities and towns. The court order is seen as an attempt to silence Navalny's growing movement against corruption and the Kremlin's rule under President Vladimir Putin.

Meanwhile, in other news, the US is investigating a Moscow theater siege that may be linked to Al-Qaeda. Analysts say the investigation could pose diplomatic complications at a time when the US is strengthening its cooperation with Russia on law enforcement and counterterrorism.

In related developments, a Dutch court has overturned a $50 billion ruling against Russia in a long-standing case involving Yukos oil company. The Russian government has welcomed the decision, which it claims proves that Yukos engaged in massive tax fraud throughout its existence.

The US is also concerned about Russia's potential sale of advanced air defense systems to Syria, which could limit the ability of Western nations to operate over Syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone. The move has raised concerns among diplomats and intelligence officials.

Global Economic Shifts and Geopolitical Tensions

A recent series of events has highlighted the complex interplay between global economic shifts, geopolitical tensions, and the actions of influential individuals. The World Economic Forum in Davos saw Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev present Russia's investment case to a global audience, sparking questions about the country's ability to attract foreign capital.

Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the influence of private corporations on international relations. A recent investigation has revealed that certain companies, including those with ties to the Rothschild family, may be seeking to destabilize global stability by fueling tensions between nations.

The Middle East has also become a focal point for these tensions, as Russia's military intervention in Syria continues to shape the region's dynamics. The conflict has drawn in various actors, including Western powers and regional players, each with their own agendas and interests.

In addition, there have been reports of unusual transactions and financial maneuvers, which some analysts believe may be linked to efforts to manipulate global markets or exert influence over key industries. These developments have raised concerns about the potential for economic instability and conflict.

As the world navigates these complex challenges, it is essential to consider the role of influential individuals and organizations in shaping global events. By examining the intersections between economics, geopolitics, and power dynamics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play and work towards more informed decision-making.

It provides a factual account of the recent nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, highlighting the need for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate, and discusses various topics such as the Constitution's interpretation, campaign law restrictions, and the handling of affirmative action cases.  The article aligns with the facts in the given article, mentioning President Obama's nomination, Republican resistance, and the Supreme Court's recent decisions. The tone is neutral and informative, providing a balanced view of the situation. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Supreme Court Nomination Sparks Intense Debate"" contains inaccuracies, such as Speaker John Boehner considering suing President Obama over his failure to faithfully execute the laws, which is not supported by factual evidence.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides more in-depth analysis and discussion of various topics related to the Supreme Court nomination, making it a more accurate representation of the situation. Therefore, I classify this article as RELIABLE with high confidence.","Supreme Court Nomination Sparks Intense Debate

The nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court has sparked intense debate, with Republicans vowing to block his confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the American people deserve a say in filling the conservative seat, and he is determined to prevent any consideration of Garland's nomination.

Meanwhile, Democrats are facing criticism for their handling of the situation. Speaker John Boehner has considered suing President Obama over his failure to faithfully execute the laws, but experts argue that this would be a mistake, as it would shift public attention away from the president's actions.

The Supreme Court is at the center of the debate, with Garland's nomination seen as a key test of the court's power. His questionnaire reveals a history of anti-gun and anti-free speech rulings, which has raised concerns among conservatives.

The situation has also highlighted the deep divisions within the country, with some arguing that the hatred towards President Trump has reached a ""dangerous level."" Others are calling for a change in Senate rules to allow for the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch, despite Democratic opposition.

As the nomination process unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Garland will be confirmed or blocked. One thing is clear: the Supreme Court's future hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the country.","A Divided Senate: The Supreme Court Nomination and Its Aftermath

The recent nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court has highlighted the need for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. As a lifelong Republican, one cannot help but wonder if the strict interpretation of the Constitution is being observed.

President Obama's nomination was met with resistance from some Republicans, who vowed to deny any Obama nominee even a confirmation hearing. However, this stance may have unintended consequences, as it could lead to a Trump nominee being considered for the Supreme Court seat.

The recent decision by the Supreme Court to loosen advertising restrictions in campaign law has also sparked debate. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stated that advertisements explicitly urging a vote for or against a particular candidate can be kept off the air during the pre-election period.

Meanwhile, research suggests that prosecutors tend to target opposition party defendants with weaker cases, rather than those from the president's party. This dynamic appears to be driven by charges being filed more quickly against opposition party members before elections.

The Supreme Court has also been criticized for its handling of affirmative action and executive power cases. Some argue that the court is not sufficiently political in the right direction, while others believe it is moving too far in a conservative direction.

As the Senate prepares to consider Judge Garland's nomination, it is clear that the stakes are high. The outcome will depend on the ability of both parties to put aside their differences and work towards a common goal: confirming a qualified Supreme Court justice.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

should boehner sue obama? (before it's news) roger pilon well into our sixth year with this president, we’re long past the point of having to demonstrate his indifference to the rule of law—the unconstitutional appointments, the obamacare rewrites, the irs and va scandals, the list goes on. in fact, it’s obama’s indifference simply to doing his job that lately has drawn attention. “the bear is loose”—on the golf course, in the pool hall, dining late with athletes and entertainers. it’s driven house republicans to talk of impeachment and of a house suit against him for his failure to faithfully execute the laws. both would be a mistake, thomas sowell tells us this morning, and he’s right. as november’s mid-term elections loom just ahead, either course would shift public attention from obama to his critics, just as happened when the house impeached president clinton. not that there isn’t a case to be made for both impeachment and a suit. but impeachment, at the end of the day, is less a legal than a political matter, as we saw in the clinton episode. so too is the suit that speaker boehner is now considering. both proposals, therefore, have to be looked at through that lens. to a good many in the house, however, a suit against the president seems like the lesser but wiser course. and contrary to first impressions, including my own, such

(before it's news) today marks the launch of thecollegeconservative–a new daily publication for conservative college students, by conservative college students. i have the esteemed pleasure of serving as one of three assistant editors and as a contributor. here’s my debut piece entitled, “of principle and pragmatism: why conservatism always trumps moderation”: in this time of great moral and economic peril, certain individuals continue to call for a radical transformation of our nation’s traditions, laws, and customs. then-senator, now-president obama championed “hope and change” and subsequently delivered class warfare rhetoric, socialized healthcare, appeasement, and anti-americanism, to name a few. similarly, republicans—most pointedly, republicans in name only (rinos)—want to dilute the conservative message because “it alienates moderates and independents.” proponents of such change, particularly liberal republicans, succeeded in undermining conservatism in 2006 and 2008. towards the end of his presidency, president george w. bush emboldened big government policies like no child left behind, tarp, and billion-dollar budget shortfalls. conservatism suffered a similar blow when john mccain clinched the republican nomination in 2008. he was representative of the republican party gone awry: unabashedly moderate, disconnected from

Article 4 - time for the senate to tell obama where he can put his phone and pen
time for the senate to tell obama where he can put his phone and pen (before it's news) since the day he was elected, obama has treated congress like a lazy set of his own personal scribes. if they wrote whatever law he wanted them to, he patted them on their heads and told them, “good job.” if not, he just sighed and wrote whatever he wanted into law anyway, then chastised them publicly for being terrible at passing laws exactly the way he wanted them passed. immediately after he was elected, republicans in the house met with obama and expressed some concerns about the the early items on his agenda, including the size and allocation of the stimulus funds. as soon as they started talking, obama interrupted boehner and said, “i won,” and then terminated the meeting, thus setting the tone for the entirety of his presidency. when obamacare could not actually garner the support it needed to pass under regular order due to the fact that scott brown was elected specifically to stop it from passing, democrats (with the full blessing of obama) passed it under reconciliation even though it was not a budget bill. when democrats became skittish about the electoral consequences of the deadlines and penalties associated with obamacare, obama repeatedly just essentially rewrote the law without congress by extending statutory deadlines, treating them as optional, or just not enforcing them at all. at no point did he ever even contemplate approaching congress and asking them to

the democrats cannot come to grips with the fact that trump won the election, that’s why the only way they respond is thru hatred. it’s clear that the liberals and gop elites prefer to keep the status quo rather than help our country. they fear losing their power and see president trump as a threat because his prime desire is to make america great again! “the o’reilly factor,” host bill o’reilly on wednesday on fox news channel’s said that the hatred towards president donald trump had reached a “dangerous level.” o’reilly said, “here’s a question i would like posed to the american people. do you believe that the hatred towards president trump has reached a dangerous level in this country? the answer is yes. whether you like the president or not, it is brutally unfair to undermine his administration, some of his opponents are trying to do. we have the democratic party refusing to cooperate on anything. now, it looks like senate rules will have to be changed to appoint judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court because not enough democrats will support the man. it is clear that judge gorsuch is qualified. it is also clear the most powerful democrat in congress, senator chuck schumer, would look askance at any of his colleagues who support the judge.” he continued: “many democratic senators fear mr. schumer. as fair-minded people will concede, there was hatred towards president obama. there was. but in the first months

(before it's news) democrats are twisting themselves into 3-d pretzels figuring out ways to oppose neil gorsuch’s nomination to the supreme court. that dunderhead from california, kamala harris, thinks gorsuch is supposed to be a ralph naderite, ignoring the law to “look out of the little guy.” others have parroted chuck schumer’s goofy, “outside the mainstream” drivel and now senator blumenthal of connecticut who laughingly pretended the might support gorsuch’s nomination opposes him because he’d cover for trump in the event of an impeachment proceeding that might require supreme court intervention. partial transcript: “i am still angry about the treatment of [president barack obama’s nominee] merrick garland. my republican colleagues have said if the shoe were on the other foot, we would have done the same. it would have been as wrong if we had [refused to give garland a hearing] as it was when they did. “but my vote is not about merrick garland. it is about neil gorsuch, and it is about the constitutional crisis that may well be looming as a potential threat to our democracy.” blumenthal reminded us fbi director james comey has testified that the agency is investigating

platforms offer a stark choice (before it's news) platforms offer a stark choice by phyllis schlafly august 3, 2016 the republican and democratic parties adopted new platforms at their conventions last month, and they have fundamentally different plans for america’s future. the two major party platforms have not been this different from each other in our lifetimes. a platform should be a statement of principles that can last for many years, not a partisan political attack against a particular candidate. the republican party platform has only one reference to hillary clinton and barely mentions republican candidates of the past or present, while the democratic party platform rants against donald trump 32 times. the democratic party platform wants federal taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, and for the first time calls for repealing the 40-year-old hyde amendment which limits federal spending on abortion. the republican party platform opposes the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortion and declares that “the unborn child has a fundamental right to life.” the vacancy of conservative justice antonin scalia hangs in the balance in this election, and the democratic party platform tells us what their top priority is. when selecting the next supreme court justices and all future nominations to the federal bench, democrats promise to appoint judges who will “protect” the abortion industry. the republican platform explains that there is “a national crisis in our judiciary” due to activism by democrat-appointed federal judges. “only a republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule

(before it's news) fellow conservative, merrick garland submitted his “questionnaire” to the senate for consideration today and it is far worse than we thought. we already know that garland ruled that the government has a right to keep a registry of american gun owners even though the law explicitly prohibits it (nra v reno). he also voted against re-hearing seegars v gonzales, proving that he does not believe the 2nd amendment should protect an individual right to keep and bear arms. if he is added to the bench, then he becomes the vote that would overturn justice scalia’s groundbreaking heller ruling. the list of garland’s anti-gun cases is long. but with his submission today, his anti-gun stance is just the beginning. he has ruled against the 1st amendment’s free speech protections (wagner v fec), in favor of terrorists held in guantanamo bay (parhat v gates), he let a drug trafficker out of prison on a technicality (us v gaskins), and most ridiculously, he once ruled that if a corporation purchases land and plans to develop it, the government can come in and stop the entire project for its environmental impact (rancho viejo, llc v. norton). the questionnaire that garland submitted has hundreds of citations for past

Article 1 - advice for the senate: act on the supreme court nominee
to the editor: regarding president obama’s nomination of judge merrick b. garland to fill the supreme court seat vacated by the death of justice antonin scalia (news articles, nytimes.com, march 16): as a lifelong republican, i ask the senate leadership to observe the strict interpretation of the constitution: that the president appoints nominees to the supreme court, subject to the advice and consent of the senate. we do not wait until we have a new president. hold hearings; then vote. this is an opportunity for a great event for this country: closing the book on the raucous hearings over the failed nomination of judge robert bork in 1987. it was wrong, but it is time for this occasion to start a bipartisan spirit in congress whose absence has caused havoc in the country. it is time to move forward. peter armenia farmingdale, n.j. to the editor: the likelihood that donald trump will be the republican presidential nominee will create an unforeseen opportunity for president obama to secure approval of his supreme court nominee, merrick b. garland. republicans who have vowed to deny any obama nominee even a confirmation hearing will have to consider the possibility that if they hold to their intransigence they may find themselves and the country in the dubious position of having to consider a trump nominee for the supreme court. advertisement continue reading the main story this dilemma should cause the leaders of the opposition to the president’s exercise

Article 2 - illegitimate politics
to the editor: in his review of ken gormley’s “death of american virtue: clinton vs. starr” (feb. 21), richard berke slips a major historical distortion into an other­wise fair-minded piece. berke writes: “in retrospect, it is tempting to see the clinton impeachment as having ushered in the feral reality of politics today. . . . in reality, the case belongs on the continuum that began with the toppling of robert bork’s nomination to the supreme court, continued through the clarence thomas-anita hill fracas and was followed by the contested 2000 election.” in other words, the democrats are to blame for the ugliness of recent years — the clinton impeachment; the thuggish mob atmosphere during the attempted florida recount; the poisonous, violent rhetoric of some of the recent tea party protests — all of them republican or conservative phenomena. here berke is lazily accepting what is little more than a republican political talking point devoid of any real historical substance. of the 151 nominations between this nation’s founding and the present, 28 nominations, nearly 20 percent, have been rejected, withdrawn or postponed in the face of opposition. the senate’s responsibility for exercising “advice and consent” on supreme court nominees is a constitutionally mandated responsibility and one it has always exercised. some nomination fights (like bork’s) have hinged on ideological conflicts, as was the case when republic

Article 3 - justices loosen ad restrictions in campaign law
the supreme court on monday took a sharp turn away from campaign finance regulation, opening a wide exception to the advertising restrictions that it upheld when the mccain-feingold law first came before it four years ago. in a splintered 5-to-4 decision, chief justice john g. roberts jr. said that as interpreted broadly by federal regulators and the law's supporters, the restrictions on television advertisements paid for from corporate or union treasuries in the weeks before an election amounted to censorship of core political speech unless those advertisements explicitly urge a vote for or against a particular candidate. ''where the first amendment is implicated,'' the chief justice said, ''the tie goes to the speaker, not the censor.'' consequently, chief justice roberts said, the only advertisements that can be kept off the air in the pre-election period covered by the law -- the 30 days before a primary election and the 60 days before a general election -- are those that are ''susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.'' describing and then dismissing the rationale for the advertising restrictions, chief justice roberts used a phrase that seemed to sum up the new majority's view toward campaign finance regulation. ''enough is enough,'' the chief justice said. the decision was a reminder of the ways in which the justices appointed by president bush are moving the court. while chief justice roberts's predecessor, chief justice william h. rehnquist, was a

Article 4 - clinton case in context: when politics and prosecutions overlap
contrary to previous research, we found little evidence that united states attorneys or the career prosecutors whom they supervise target opposition party defendants with weaker cases — no measurable difference was observed in conviction rates between parties. in fact, prosecutors seem to treat members of the president’s party more harshly in resolving cases, perhaps to avoid the appearance of favoritism in plea deals that typically involve recommendations for sentence reductions. photo however, we did find significant partisan differences in the timing of cases around elections. compared with co-partisans, opposition defendants were relatively more likely to face corruption charges before a state or federal general election rather than after. this dynamic appears to be driven by charges being filed more quickly against opposition party members before elections. why do we observe these differences in the timing of cases? we argue that many prosecutors have ambitions to hold higher office and are thus sensitive to the preferences of political patrons, whose support is essential to obtaining positions such as judgeships (for united states attorneys) or united states attorney (for career prosecutors). (as f.b.i. director, mr. comey is in a different position; he was appointed by barack obama and is serving a 10-year term.) these patrons may welcome charges against opposition party members or fear that their allies will be targeted during the sensitive pre-election period. for instance, david iglesias, the former united states attorney for new mexico, tells of receiving pressure from republican members of congress to file charges against democrats before the 2006 elections

Article 5 - a court remade in the reagan era's image
on the whole, though, veterans of the reagan years expressed satisfaction about what they had achieved even before the two new justices arrived. charles fried, who was united states solicitor general from 1985 to 1989 and now teaches law at harvard, said that with just a few exceptions the court had in the last 20 years corrected what he called the excesses of the warren court, which moved the law in a liberal direction in the 1950's and 60's in decisions concerning race, religion, criminal procedure and the role of the federal courts. ""i'm perfectly happy with things as they are now,"" professor fried said. ""the sky is not falling. we just have to repair a few holes in the sky. what remains to be done is to return the law to the place where justice o'connor -- and only in the past few years -- suffered a change of heart."" justice sandra day o'connor, justice alito's predecessor, took a relatively liberal position on affirmative action and executive power in some recent cases. many scholars trace the intellectual roots of the reagan-era project from a speech that attorney general edwin meese iii gave to the american bar association in 1985, not long after he moved to the justice department after working for four years as one of mr. reagan's closest advisers in the white house. mr. meese criticized the supreme court for what he called incoherent decisions based on the

Article 6 - making roberts talk
he came, he charmed, he shut up. during the opening statements, the senators blathered away their time and more; judge john roberts used less than half of his to utter a few graceful generalities. he has made a career out of not saying the wrong thing. why start now? a lawyer who has been cross-examined dozens of times by the supreme court will not be caught off guard by senators posing as legal scholars. there has never been a nominee better prepared to dodge constitutional questions. the only hope for democrats is to try the tactics used by interrogation pros like israeli airport screeners and u.s. customs agents. these experts know that a smart criminal will have rehearsed a cover story for, say, what he was doing in london and why he's going to new york. but if he's asked something unexpected -- how he liked the london weather, whether he's planning to visit times square -- he has to change mental gears. he's apt to exhibit telltale signs of a liar under stress, like gazing upward and to his right as he answers. advertisement continue reading the main story i'm not suggesting that mr. roberts is a liar, or that anything the democrats ask today could stop him from being confirmed. but they might at least keep tv viewers awake by trying questions like these: if roe v. wade were a tree, what kind of tree would it be? is there any chance that you could speed

Article 7 - blaming the chief justice
even before the trump-focused blame game started, chief justice roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right’s favorite punching bag. in a rambling speech on the senate floor last month, senator charles e. grassley, the iowa republican who heads the judiciary committee, defended the republican refusal to move forward with president obama’s nomination of judge merrick b. garland to fill the supreme court’s vacant seat. playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before justice antonin scalia’s unexpected death, to the effect that the senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, senator grassley said it was the roberts court itself that was political. “physician, heal thyself,” he said, and then offered this observation: justices appointed by republicans are generally committed to following the law. there are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. but some of the justices appointed by republicans often don’t vote in a way that advances conservative policy. in other words, could it be that the problem with chief justice roberts is that he isn’t sufficiently political in the right direction? that was certainly the message gov. greg abbott of texas sent last month when called the chief justice “the tip of the spear in playing politics.” in remarks at the heritage foundation, he explained: “chief justice john roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote obamacare twice. what we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played

Article 8 - the night of the split decision
this year democratic voters are facing an embarrassment of riches, and many of us went to the polls wishing we could vote for both candidates. a vote for senator hillary rodham clinton doesn’t mean dislike for senator barack obama, and vice versa. it just reflects the fact that we can choose only one person when we cast a vote. therefore i see little problem with democratic voters rallying around whichever candidate ends up the nominee. ginny mayer dana point, calif., feb. 6, 2008  to the editor: re “with issues of war and peace on their minds, voters make choices” (news article, feb. 6): it’s difficult for me to rationalize the fact that most voters believed that the economy was the most important issue in this primary election. the economy will recover; it always does. meanwhile, the war in iraq has claimed thousands of americans who will never return, and tens of thousands who will return but who will never be completely whole again. a war with no end in sight. george solovay florham park, n.j., feb. 6, 2008  to the editor: i was shocked at your claim in “divided they run” (editorial, feb. 6) that democracy demands party allegiance above all. in noting that many of barack obama’s supporters reported that they may not vote in the general election if mr. ob

the 2016 fight for the senate majority was filled with tension, drama and surprises — so much so that two days from the finish line, the outcome is still very much in the air. both parties scored last-minute star recruits that upended the senate map, and both sides intervened in primaries to ensure their favored candidates emerged unscathed. states initially thought to be major fights such as ohio dropped from the radar, while the political terrain surprisingly shifted to red-hued states such as missouri and indiana. and throughout much of the year, a controversial and unpredictable republican nominee caused problem after problem for mitch mcconnell and gop senators running to save their majority. story continued below here’s politico’s look at the 16 moments that defined the battle for the senate in 2016: 1. reid retires – teeing up a nevada battle royale harry reid suffered a devastating injury while working out on new year’s day 2015 but vowed to fight on, despite republicans gearing up to defeat their most hated foe in his difficult reelection contest. but by late march, reid decided he would retire, shaking the structure of the senate as well as creating a high-profile race to succeed him. now nevada’s senate race is pivotal to either party’s hopes of senate control, and though reid insists that democrat catherine cortez masto will beat gop rep. joe heck, the contest is razor-thin.

Title: democrats should be reminded they set the standard on blocking judicial nominees, not republicans
Content: democrats should be reminded they set the standard on blocking judicial nominees, not republicans (before it's news) democrats always believe history starts whenever a republican does something they don’t like, and anything they say has an expiration date. barack obama in 2012 was not responsible for anything he said in 2008 because in the mind of democrats, whatever obama said, expired and the new statement takes over. similarly, there is a lot of weeping going on over merrick garland. most democrats (and the liberals in the entertainment industry engaging in identical weeping) couldn’t pick merrick garland out of a lineup, but they’re treating him like the girl who couldn’t get a date to the prom. when antonin scalia passed away last year, republicans immediately announced they would not entertain a replacement in an election year and obama’s lame duck year. obama, whose ego is only outsized by president trump’s, defied republicans and nominated garland anyway. republicans stuck to their word and didn’t consider garland. i feel sorry for the man, having been used by democrats as a political pawn. democrats history of blocking and attempting to block, qualified judicial nominees goes back 30 years to the robert bork nomination in 1987. bork had impeccable credentials and sat on the same court circuit court (dc) as antonin scalia who was confirmed the year before and confirmed unanimously. the smearing of bork started when that lowlife, ted kennedy, took to the floor of the senate and said the following: robert bork’s america is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government, and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. considering kennedy was less than 20 years removed from when he left mary jo kopechne to die in a car in chappaquiddick, it still stuns me that he could smear somebody in such a way. the smear took hold, however, and bork was eventually rejected in the senate. bork was so angry with the treatment he received from democrats (and their cohorts in the media) that bork resigned his appellate court judgeship in 1988. four years after bork was nominated to the supreme court, clarence thomas was nominated to serve on the supreme court by president goerge h.w. bush. enter another smear campaign, this one led by the liar, anita hill. hill famously accused thomas of sexual harassment. the hearings thomas faced were brutal, and

A Divided Senate: The Supreme Court Nomination and Its Aftermath

The recent nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court has highlighted the need for bipartisan cooperation in the Senate. As a lifelong Republican, one cannot help but wonder if the strict interpretation of the Constitution is being observed.

President Obama's nomination was met with resistance from some Republicans, who vowed to deny any Obama nominee even a confirmation hearing. However, this stance may have unintended consequences, as it could lead to a Trump nominee being considered for the Supreme Court seat.

The recent decision by the Supreme Court to loosen advertising restrictions in campaign law has also sparked debate. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stated that advertisements explicitly urging a vote for or against a particular candidate can be kept off the air during the pre-election period.

Meanwhile, research suggests that prosecutors tend to target opposition party defendants with weaker cases, rather than those from the president's party. This dynamic appears to be driven by charges being filed more quickly against opposition party members before elections.

The Supreme Court has also been criticized for its handling of affirmative action and executive power cases. Some argue that the court is not sufficiently political in the right direction, while others believe it is moving too far in a conservative direction.

As the Senate prepares to consider Judge Garland's nomination, it is clear that the stakes are high. The outcome will depend on the ability of both parties to put aside their differences and work towards a common goal: confirming a

Supreme Court Nomination Sparks Intense Debate

The nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court has sparked intense debate, with Republicans vowing to block his confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that the American people deserve a say in filling the conservative seat, and he is determined to prevent any consideration of Garland's nomination.

Meanwhile, Democrats are facing criticism for their handling of the situation. Speaker John Boehner has considered suing President Obama over his failure to faithfully execute the laws, but experts argue that this would be a mistake, as it would shift public attention away from the president's actions.

The Supreme Court is at the center of the debate, with Garland's nomination seen as a key test of the court's power. His questionnaire reveals a history of anti-gun and anti-free speech rulings, which has raised concerns among conservatives.

The situation has also highlighted the deep divisions within the country, with some arguing that the hatred towards President Trump has reached a ""dangerous level."" Others are calling for a change in Senate rules to allow for the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch, despite Democratic opposition.

As the nomination process unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Garland will be confirmed or blocked. One thing is clear: the Supreme Court's future hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the country.

Article 10 - <em>the family</em> and <em>a.k.a. doc pomus</em>
(before it's news) the family is a movie made with so little respect for our intelligence that you wonder who would want to impose it on us. (answer: luc besson, its alarmingly prolific director and co-writer.) let’s start at the top. several spoilers, if those are possible, follow. robert de niro is giovanni manzoni, a new york mafia boss who ratted out his fellow crime lords some years back, putting them in prison and himself and his family into the federal witness protection program. ever since then, giovanni—renamed fred blake—and his wife maggie (michelle pfeiffer) and now-teenage kids belle (dianna agron) and warren (john d’leo) have been living in france, shielded from lethal emissaries of the incarcerated mafiosi by a team of fbi agents led by robert stansfield (tommy lee jones). okay. leaving aside the possibly irrelevant detail that the federal witness protection program is run by the u.s. marshals service, not the fbi, would any government agency go to the major expense of relocating a mafia snitch to europe (especially france—next door to italy), and assign to him a permanent detail of agents who presumably could be doing more important things? you’ll recall that in goodfellas, the equally endangered mafia turncoat henry hill was tucked away much closer to home.

Article 1 - song lyrics and memoirs for all seasons
the holiday season can be a bit of a bummer for die-hard theater lovers. they have already seen all of the important fall openings — all they care to, anyway — and they tend to turn up their noses at the festive fare aimed at extracting maximum dollars from tourists with children. to help divert your friends during this anxious time, these new books and dvds — and one actual show guaranteed not to send sophisticated theatergoers into sugar shock — are recommended. ‘the complete lyrics of oscar hammerstein ii’ edited by amy asch. (alfred a. knopf, $65.) anyone with a glancing interest in theater will be familiar with a few immortal phrases from “oh, what a beautiful mornin’ ” or “some enchanted evening.” but this hefty, handsome volume reveals anew the breadth, range and sheer fecundity of a central figure — maybe the central figure — in the evolution of the american musical theater. hammerstein wrote revue songs, operettas, musical comedies and of course the musical plays, with richard rodgers, that changed the face of broadway forever and are so crucial to the musical canon. the book contains 850 lyrics, a quarter previously unpublished, with deeply researched notes and commentary by ms. asch that add color and context, although the limpid poetry of hammerstein’s best lyrics needs little of either to shine. photo ‘christine pedi’s holly jolly christmas folly’ (at the

*+ ''i am my own wife.'' doug wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by jefferson mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by moisés kaufman, has made a rewarding transition to broadway. the play tells a terrific story based on a real person, charlotte von mahlsdorf (né lothar berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. her lifelong obsession -- mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like victrolas and gramophones. her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. the play is largely about charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the nazis and the communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the gestapo and the stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. ah, but are they credible? that also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:30). lyceum, 149 west 45th street, (212) 239-6200. tuesdays, th

Title: david rogers, stage adapter of offbeat material, dies at 85
Content: “flowers for algernon,” daniel keyes’s novel about a mentally handicapped man who is temporarily transformed into a genius, has been read by millions and recreated in many forms, including the 1968 film “charly” (playing the title role, cliff robertson won an academy award). but singing along with any version was impossible until david rogers reinterpreted it as the musical “charlie and algernon.” “charlie and algernon,” for which mr. rogers wrote the book and lyrics (charles strouse wrote the music), opened on broadway in 1980 and was nominated for a tony for best original score. it was mr. rogers’s best-known effort — but it was far from his only unlikely adaptation for the stage. mr. rogers, who died on june 5 at 85, wrote plays based on aldous huxley’s “brave new world” and the 1973 caper film “the sting”; musical adaptations of “the hobbit” (music by allan jay friedman) and “a midsummer night’s dream” (“the dream on royal street,” music by alan menken); and original work like “not for keeps” and “even the shadows dance.” the broadway production of “charlie and algernon” starred p. j. benjamin as charlie, sandy faison as his teacher and love interest and an uncredited mouse as algernon. mr. rogers had written “flowers for algernon” as a play, which was performed in high school and college theaters, years before he and mr. strouse worked on the musical. photo the show opened to mixed reviews. in the new york times, frank rich called it “a very ordinary and at times very irritating entertainment,” but mel gussow called it “a show with a heart about our minds.” advertisement continue reading the main story david rogers was born in new york city on dec. 15, 1927. he served in the army signal corps during the korean war before studying drama alongside jack lemmon and lee marvin at the .

As the United States continues to grapple with a crippling student loan debt crisis, it's clear that something is amiss. With over 18 million students enrolled in nearly 5,000 colleges and universities across the country, the cost of higher education has skyrocketed – a staggering 400% increase since just 30 years ago.

The average college graduate now graduates with over $30,000 in student loan debt, a number that continues to grow. This has led to a situation where many young adults are forced to delay buying homes, potentially slowing the housing recovery. In fact, total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion, making it one of the largest debt bubbles in history.

The consequences of this crisis are far-reaching. With fewer young people entering the workforce, there is pressure on social security and medicare – two programs that will be severely impacted by the impending retirement crisis. Meanwhile, students who cannot qualify for a loan to buy their first home are left with no choice but to live in apartments or rely on family members.

The system has been designed to keep poor and middle-class families out of college, perpetuating a cycle of debt that is impossible to escape. With many institutions charging upwards of $40,000 per year in tuition and fees, the cost of higher education has become prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest students.

As the situation continues to deteriorate, it's clear that something needs to be done. Politicians are calling for action, with some proposing solutions such as forgiving 100% of federal student loans or limiting what institutions can charge. However, it remains to be seen whether these proposals will be enough to address the root causes of this crisis.

One thing is certain: the great college education scam must come to an end. It's time for policymakers to take action and find a solution to this debt bubble before it's too late.","Student Debt Crisis Deepens

The United States is facing a growing student debt crisis, with the average college graduate now carrying nearly $18,000 in debt. This trend has been exacerbated by rising tuition costs, which have outpaced inflation in recent years.

A recent survey found that fewer students than ever believe taking on loans to attend college was worth it. In fact, only 59% of borrowers say that the benefits of their educational debt outweigh the downsides, a warning sign that if debt levels continue to rise, students may start shying away from universities or at least more expensive ones.

The consequences of this trend are far-reaching. Many students are forced to revamp their career goals to pay off their loans, and some are even questioning whether they should have borrowed so much money in the first place. This has led to a surge in loan defaults, with many borrowers struggling to make payments.

To address this issue, some universities are increasing financial aid packages to keep educational debt to a minimum. Meanwhile, loan companies are urging students to borrow less, wherever possible. However, for many students, loans have become an inescapable reality.

The situation is not unique to the United States. In other countries, similar issues with student debt and rising tuition costs are also being felt. The impact on individuals and families is significant, with many struggling to make ends meet or facing financial ruin.

As policymakers grapple with this issue, some experts argue that a more sustainable approach is needed. This could involve exploring alternative models for higher education, such as those seen in other countries. Others suggest that job-training institutions should be developed to attract students interested in pursuing middle-skill jobs.

Ultimately, the student debt crisis requires a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of rising tuition costs and loan defaults. By working together, policymakers, educators, and lenders can help ensure that higher education remains accessible and affordable for all.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

16 shocking facts about the student loan debt bubble and the great college education scam % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) as you read this, there are over 18 million students enrolled at the nearly 5,000 colleges and universities currently in operation across the united states. many of these institutions of higher learning are now charging $$20,000, $$30,000 or even $$40,000 a year for tuition and fees. that does not even count living expenses. today it is 400% more expensive to go to college in the united states than it was just 30 years ago. most of these 18 million students have been told over and over that a “higher education” is the key to getting a good job and living the american dream. they have been told not to worry about how much it costs and that there is plenty of financial aid (mostly made up of loans) available. now our economy is facing the biggest student loan debt bubble in the history of the world, and when our new college graduates enter the “real world” they are finding out that the good jobs they were promised are very few and far between. as millions of americans wake up and start realizing that the tens of thousands of dollars that they have poured into their college educations was mostly a waste, will the great college education scam finally be exposed? for now, the system continues to push the notion that a college education is the key to

the next bubble? – andy sutton (before it's news) since the housing bubble burst spectacularly in late 2007, many analysts have been actively seeking out the next likely explosion. rest assured, it will be related to debt in some way. us treasuries, credit cards, and potentially another disaster on wall street thanks to over-leveraging have all been mentioned as potential leading candidates. however, there is another bubble out there and it too is debt related. this one, in my opinion, has far greater consequences because it involves a group that is the least financially able to deal with the ramifications. i’m talking about student loans and the massive bubble that has been expanding for at least the past decade. i can remember a time back in the 1980s when i had several relatives put themselves through state schools by working during the summer and on holidays. they either didn’t carry student loans, or if they did, they were exceedingly small. granted, these were not ivy league institutions or anything like that, but it was possible to get an education without going bankrupt. if parents were able to kick in a few bucks, many kids could walk out of college either debt free or very close to it. credit cards for college students were virtually unheard of. fast-forward a couple of decades and for college students who have credit cards, the average balance upon gradation is around $$4,000 while the average debt of people in the 19-24 age group

your kid sister and younger cousin are unbanked and using alternative financial services (before it's news) if you think it is the fringes of society that are underbanked, you’re wrong. as usa today notes: nearly half of young adult households, those ages 15 to 34, are considered under-banked, according to a survey by the federal deposit insurance corporation in 2009, the latest year for which there is data. why is that? it’s the great recession of course, plus the rising cost of college. as the ny times notes: with more than $$1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. as prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden. about two-thirds of bachelor’s degree recipients borrow money to attend college, either from the government or private lenders, according to a department of education survey of 2007-8 graduates; the total number of borrowers is most likely higher since the survey does not track borrowing from family members. the problem is even more pronounced for teens. as christian science monitor notes: the great recession can explain some of the decline in job opportunities for young people. during the mid-2000s, the overall teenage unemployment rate ranged between 14 and 18 percent. then

austerity sledgehammer: at least half a million college students on waiting lists as loans dry up; colleges face mass layoffs % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) austerity measures, though unpopular and not discussed by government officials and media pundits, are in full effect across a broad spectrum of services and industries. in many parts of the country local governments are being forced to layoff or cut the salaries of thousands of emergency personnel. education spending cuts across debt behemoths like california, illionois and michigan are forcing elementary and high school classrooms to capacities exceeding thirty or forty students at a time and removing subjects like art, music and physical education from school schedules. towns and cities all over america are declaring bankruptcy on an almost weekly basis. government sponsored health care systems are feeling the pressure with major cuts in access to key prescription medications quickly becoming the norm. just two years ago the idea that austerity cuts would hit america like an 8-pound sledgehammer was inconceivable. today it’s become quite apparent, especially for those just entering college or returning to higher education in an effort to learn new skills for a dying or dead jobs market. in addition to nearly $$1 billion in state funding cuts for college students, the progressive state of california and others are now facing massive jobs cuts and salary reductions across the board. this is only going to get worse – it can be no other way: more than 470,000 community college students

(before it's news) by monica davis as they did with mortgages, behind the scenes financial manipulators are playing with student load debt. students are under a triple threat: rising student loan rates, public disenvestment in higher education, and few jobs for college graduates. polict analysts say that congress must act now. american students literally can not afford for them to ignore the july 1 deadline and the doubling of student loan rates. washington—as education leaders across the nation are calling on congress to act before july 1 to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling, a new report released today by the american federation of teachers warns that the combination of massive student debt and public disinvestment in higher education threatens americans’ ability to gain access to and successfully complete college. the report—“on the backs of students and families: disinvestment in higher education and the student loan debt crisis”—outlines a series of policy recommendations aimed at advancing goals that “must be achieved if our nation is to have a prosperous economy, a healthy democracy and a just society.” those goals include: relieving the student debt burden for current borrowers; promoting debt-free higher education; enhancing state funding for public higher education; prioritizing academic needs in college and university budgets; and eliminating the fraud and abuse that entrap borrowers in debt. cost of college

Article 6 - marco rubio 2016 platforms: on the issues & his views
sen. marco rubio of florida has been a rising star in republican politics for years now. his well-spoken message hits with both the establishment and conservative bases, which makes him an ultra-appealing candidate now that he has picked up some viable traction in the 2016 election. sen. rubio has a compelling story for college students or recent graduates, especially those facing a mountain of student loans, as he had to finance his own college career. unlike some other politicians who had their way paved through an inheritance or benefit of family wealth, rubio did everything on his own. and because of that, he’s gaining some much-needed respect from millennials. tuition cost & student debt while the average college student is graduating with more than $$30,000 in student loan debt – a number that continues to grow – there is an increasingly large push to change the system as it exists today to prevent future college students from suffering the same . sen. marco rubio is no stranger to college debt. he’s said before that just a few years ago he too had over $$100,000 in student loan debt. this combined with his desire to truly change the system and prevent institutions from continuing to have a stronghold on higher education delivers to millennials looking for an education fix. limiting what institutions can charge, reducing the overall input into government programs to pay for an “outdated” education system, and modernizing our higher education system are just a couple of the ways rubio plans to overhaul the

Article 7 - why college costs so much
why college costs so much (before it's news) from nypost.com it’s graduation season across america, a time when our politicos come out to bore us with their commencement orations. if only that’s all they did. unfortunately, they’re also doing their darnedest to ensure that the cost of a college degree is rising much faster than the ability to pay for it. former education secretary william bennett sums up a big part of the problem in a new book titled “is college worth it?” in it, he and his co-author note that since 1990 the cost of attending a four-year college has risen at four times the rate of inflation. over that same period, federally supported student loans have skyrocketed, to the point where student-loan debt now exceeds credit-card debt. continue reading at nypost.com… source: http://financialsurvivalnetwork.com/2013/05/why-college-costs-so-much/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-college-costs-so-much

Article 8 - new: why not skip college?
new: why not skip college? (before it's news) john seiler: katy grimes reported here at calwatchdog.com on the protests against cuts in aid to college students. that means higher tuition — “fees” — to attend state colleges and universities. here’s an idea for how kids can cut the costs of going to college: don’t go. it’s a myth that going to college always leads to higher pay. sometimes it does. if you want to be a doctor or lawyer, there’s no choice but to go to school for the better part of a decade. but a degree in sociology or psychology or english is almost worthless. you end up with debt totaling maybe $$50,000 and have wasted four years taking pointless classes between smoking reefers when you could have spent those precious years starting a career or a business — or getting married and having kids. and let’s face it, after social security and medicare go broke, the only retirement security most people will have in 20 years or so will be their kids. do college people generally make more money? yes, but that’s because they’re smarter in general. and smart people, in general, make more money. if the smart kids had skipped college, they’d still be smart at whatever else they did. look at bill gates and the late steve jobs. they dropped out to start computer companies now worth hundreds of billions of dollars. would they have done better if they had gotten degrees in

Article 10 - housing recovery? economic recovery? forget it
housing recovery? economic recovery? forget it (before it's news) forget it folks. when you add all this together with the demographic problems we have, you’ve got the ingredients for a disaster — a disaster we are going to encounter sooner rather than later. the amount americans owe on student loans is far higher than earlier estimates and could lead some consumers to postpone buying homes, potentially slowing the housing recovery, u.s. officials said wednesday. total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $$1 trillion late last year, said officials at the consumer financial protection bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis. that would be roughly 16% higher than an estimate earlier this year by the federal reserve bank of new york. this is going to destroy retirements and those who currently own homes. you’re finished folks. here’s the problem — we have a demographics issue, as everyone who has paid attention knows. that is, there are fewer young people compared to old, which leads to pressures on things like medicare and social security. but the traditional path is for older people to downsize their economic lives. they sell their big house and buy a smaller one, or live in an apartment. to sell it someone has to have money to buy it. who is that going to be? it’s not going to be the young adults now in college because we have screwed them by saddling them with this debt. they thus cannot qualify for a loan to buy your house!

Article 1 - college loans rise, swamping graduates' dreams
the growing debt has begun to encroach upon other major purchases like homes, and compels more than one in six borrowers, like mrs. miles, to revamp their career goals to pay it off, the survey found. but perhaps most important, fewer students than ever say taking out loans to attend college was worth it. when nellie mae asked its borrowers a decade ago whether the benefits of their educational debt overshadowed the downside, nearly three-quarters gave a resounding ''yes.'' now, 59 percent say the positives outweighed the negatives, a warning sign that if debt levels continue to rise, students may start shying away from universities, or at least the more expensive ones. ''what's so worrisome is that for the first time, a lot of students are questioning whether they should have borrowed so much money,'' said sandy baum, an economics professor at skidmore college who has conducted several such surveys over the last 15 years. ''what will happen when people decide it's not worth it and won't go to college at all? we're not there yet, but we're really close.'' the concern is grave enough that loan companies like nellie mae are urging students to borrow less, wherever possible, while some universities with big endowments are hurriedly increasing financial aid packages to keep educational debt to a minimum. still, for many students, loans have become an inescapable reality. even after adjusting for inflation, tuition and fees at

Article 2 - marriage and minorities
one is mass incarceration. in the two decades preceding the great recession, the american prison population nearly tripled, according to the pew center on the states. and make no mistake: mass incarceration rips at the fabric of families and whole communities. photo according to the 2011 book “a plague of prisons” by ernest drucker, a public health expert: ■ “the risk of divorce is high among men going to prison, reaching 50 percent within a few years after incarceration.” ■ “the marriage rate for men incarcerated in prisons and jails is lower than the american average. for blacks and hispanics, it is lower still.” ■ “unmarried couples in which the father has been incarcerated are 37 percent less likely to be married one year after the child’s birth than similar couples in which the father has never been incarcerated.” related to mass incarceration is the disastrous drug war, which essentially has become a war on marijuana waged primarily against young black men, even though they use the drug at nearly the same rate as whites. then there’s the aid elimination provision of the higher education act, a provision that took effect in 2000. it denied financial aid to students with drug convictions. a couple of years after it took effect, the american civil liberties union called the law “unjust and counterproductive” and “both morally wrong and unconstitutional.” researchers at cornell found last year that the provision “had a large negative impact on the college attendance of students with drug convictions”

Article 3 - competitive student loans
to the editor: re “helping students, not lenders” (editorial, march 4): while you praise the proposal to eliminate the federal family education loan program, you do not factor in the choice and valuable services offered to student borrowers that are a product of the competition between the federal family education loan program and the government’s direct loan program. the nationalization of student lending would eliminate those benefits and hurt the very students the proposal intends to help. the claim that the direct loan program is “less expensive” is tenuous at best, as originating all loans through the direct loan program during the next five years would require roughly $500 billion in new treasury borrowing. in the end, we’re confident that federal policy makers will closely scrutinize this proposal, as well as potential alternatives, before terminating a successful 40-year-old program with proven results in providing college access and opportunity for millions of students. peter warren president, education finance council washington, march 5, 2009  to the editor: why do you not support free-market principles in student loans with the same tenacity that you support them in other areas? you endorse a proposal by the obama administration to abolish guaranteed loans, thereby eliminating all consumer choice and competition in federal student loans. advertisement continue reading the main story in an editorial about the airline industry in 2007, you wrote that the government “could have gone further and opened up the american market to more competition, and the superior service and lower prices

Article 5 - remember the problems with mortgage defaults? they’re coming back with student loans
student loans, along with mortgages and car loans, have become one of the three largest sources of credit, exceeding credit-card debt. this growth in student debt appears to have caught regulators unprepared. compared with mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, student loans are loosely regulated, and that regulatory weakness is particularly threatening to consumers because they can’t discharge their debts through bankruptcy and escape lenders who are causing them harm. borrowers — and the economy at large — are suffering as a result. every borrower in default has a damaged credit record, which increases the cost of buying a home or car and can result in lost job opportunities. many landlords won’t rent to someone with a bad credit record. the parallels with the mortgage crisis are striking. in both cases, the companies managing the loans have been slow to devise loan forgiveness plans for borrowers who run into trouble, hurting both the borrowers and the broader economy. in both cases, it often isn’t clear who even owns the underlying loans, further slowing efforts to restructure them. i’ll start with the first of these problems: that so few distressed borrowers are getting help. you may remember hamp — or the home affordable modification program — which began in 2009 to allow borrowers struggling with their mortgages to remain in their homes. hamp relied on mortgage servicers to restructure the loans, and the results were extremely disappointing. the goal was for four million borrowers to enroll in hamp, but in the program’s initial year only half a million homeowners had

Article 6 - college student debt
to the editor: re “heavy debt, but no degree” (editorial, may 30): the financial consequences of dropping out of college, which you highlight, illustrate the need for additional protections so that students can complete their studies successfully. recently, a group of career colleges signed on to standards of responsible conduct and transparency, which establish greater disclosure and transparency to support students’ needs. one example is the requirement that adherent schools allow new students to enroll in a trial period for at least 21 days without incurring any tuition-related debt. this provides students with the opportunity to make sure that the institution or program they are attending is the right fit and that they are prepared for the academic challenges ahead, before taking on any debt. good information, together with a trial period without financial penalty, enables students to make wise choices about their higher education plans. all institutions of higher education should follow the example of the career colleges’ standards of responsible conduct. if they do, then the “heavy debt, no degree” problem will be sharply reduced. jonathan fanton fairfield, conn., june 1, 2012 the writer, a member of the board of advisers at the foundation for educational success, is a visiting fellow at hunter college.

Article 7 - where they’re defaulting
the default rate is perhaps the best snapshot of how graduates are struggling with student debt. (default is the worst-case scenario, when no payment is received on a loan for 270 days.) the department of education has typically tracked borrowers who default on federal loans within two years of entering their repayment period. the window has just been extended to three years, with the hope of getting a better picture of how many are in distress. an average 13.4 percent of borrowers who entered repayment in fiscal year 2009 defaulted within three years; 47 percent of them attended for-profit colleges and universities. the accompanying charts show the colleges and universities with highest and lowest three-year default rates (only institutions offering graduate degrees and with at least 500 borrowers entering repayment were considered). correction: november 5, 2012 an earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of defaulting borrowers who had attended for-profit colleges. it is 47 percent, not 22.7 percent. that is the percentage of borrowers at for-profit colleges who defaulted.

Article 8 - house democrats propose cut in student loan rates
house republicans, who in trying to contain college costs have focused in recent years on restraining tuition increases, complained friday of being shut out of the process of writing the new bill and said they would offer amendments before wednesday’s vote. “i’m hopeful we can work in a bipartisan way to build upon it, including with reforms that actually make college more affordable and more accessible for low- and middle-income students,” said representative howard p. mckeon of california, the ranking republican on mr. miller’s committee. that theme was echoed at the white house. blain rethmeier, a spokesman, said the bush administration would support efforts in congress to ease students’ burden, but added that “colleges have the central role to play in ensuring access to affordable higher education.” student debt has grown exponentially in recent years, in tandem with college costs that routinely outpace inflation. the average college student now graduates with nearly $18,000 in debt. the democratic proposal would benefit many such students: the 5.5 million a year who receive subsidized stafford loans. the measure unveiled friday would make good only in part on democrats’ campaign promise to halve the interest rates on student loans. democrats had never said that the cut would not fully take effect until 2012 or that the pledge applied only to subsidized stafford loans. unlike pell grants, which go to students with family incomes under $40,000, stafford loans are also tapped by

Article 9 - a strategy session with some of education’s top thinkers
dean of faculty, harvard graduate school of education a four-year degree isn’t for everyone by jeffrey selingo nearly 40 percent of american workers hold a bachelor’s degree. fifteen percent of mail carriers have a four-year degree, as do one in five clerical and sales workers. getting a bachelor’s degree is what going to college means to most americans. students who do not march along are often considered — or consider themselves — failures. yet the decades-long march to college has actually closed off options for young people. as recently as the 1970s, a high school graduate had a number of options: get a good-paying job right away, enlist in the military, find a trade apprenticeship or go to college. today, there are really only two options: the military or college. yet only 52 percent of young people have either a two- or four-year degree or an industry certificate by the time they reach their mid-20s. in the course of researching my new book, “there is life after college,” what i heard most from employers is a worry about filling so-called middle-skill positions in advanced manufacturing, health care and information technology. nearly half of the american work force has these jobs today, but many of them will soon be retiring. as many as 25 million of all new job openings in the next decade will be for middle-skill jobs. we need job-training institutions on par with academic institutions to attract students interested in pursuing these

Article 10 - students relying on loans wonder whether forgiveness will last
and if the forgiveness isn’t guaranteed, how on earth can anyone expect 18- or 22-year-olds to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt? without such a promise, how can they know that they won’t one day find themselves in a police uniform or in a rural doctor’s office suddenly facing personal bankruptcy ? the good news here is that the federal department of education says that almost all its loan forgiveness programs are safe. “it doesn’t depend on some future congress for us to come through on most of these,” said robert shireman, deputy undersecretary of education. “the majority of them get appropriations for the life of the programs.” but many states say that financing their loan forgiveness programs depends on state budgets. given declining tax revenues, that doesn’t inspire much confidence. on thursday, for instance, gov. m. jodi rell of connecticut proposed cutting the state’s minority teacher grant program, which awards a stipend that is intended to help students pay off their loans, said constance fraser, a connecticut department of higher education spokeswoman. the states’ changes — or the mere threat of them — are the latest of several ugly financial developments that have shaken individuals of all ages who thought they were playing by the rules. there are the investors close to retirement who thought they were being conservative only to watch their savings decline 25 percent before bouncing back a bit recently. and then there are homeowners in miami and las vegas with plain mortgages who

Title: terminate the racket of college loans
Content: (before it's news) by phyllis schlafly june 13, 2012 one of the ways to cut the big-spending binge engaged in by the federal government is to terminate the racket of college loans. it’s counterproductive, discriminatory, and a bad investment for both taxpayers and students. college-loan debt has soared to nearly a trillion dollars, more than credit-card debt or auto-loan debt. financial commentators are beginning to compare college-loan debt to the housing bubble that nearly brought down the banking system in 2008. however, it’s not the banks that will be the big losers if the bubble bursts. it’s the taxpayers, because the government is now on the hook for the majority of student loans. even worse is the burden on students. the debt requires students to keep paying for a product that lacks its advertised value either in education or employment opportunities. college education has been dumbed down to enroll more and more taxpayer-subsidized students, even if they take only remedial (a.k.a. high school) courses. college-loan debt is a powerful deterrent to marriage and to getting on with life. students cannot discharge the debt in bankruptcy, can’t get a job that justifies the loan, and may have had a lousy education. for years we’ve heard the propaganda line that everyone should go to college and that a college degree will improve your status in life and standard of living. not any more; in obamaland, 53.6 percent of young college graduates are jobless or working jobs that do not require a college degree and don’t pay enough to retire the debt. making college loans more generous and easier to get does not make college more affordable. the easy availability of loans encourages colleges to raise tuition rates faster than inflation in order to rake in more taxpayer money, while discriminating against those thrifty enough to pay their own way. the entire structure of college loans is discriminatory. it forces people who don’t want or are not able to go to college, or who work to pay their own way, to contribute taxes to support those who go to college at other people’s expense, often at pricey elite colleges. college loans seem to be based on the same pie-in-the-sky fiction that going into debt to buy a house you can’t afford is a good investment and will make you a worthier citizen. that’s another expensive lie told to gullible people by bankers and bureaucrats who should have known what they were doing. then there’s the problem, as reported by the washington post, that nearly 30 percent of students with student loans drop out of college with debt but no degree. of those who remain in college, the majority take five or six years, thus significantly increasing their debt. this wastes some of what should be the most productive years of an american’s life. when i went to college, carrying a full load of classes, i worked a 48-hour week to pay my own

The Great College Education Scam: A Debt Bubble Waiting to Burst

As the United States continues to grapple with a crippling student loan debt crisis, it's clear that something is amiss. With over 18 million students enrolled in nearly 5,000 colleges and universities across the country, the cost of higher education has skyrocketed – a staggering 400% increase since just 30 years ago.

The average college graduate now graduates with over $30,000 in student loan debt, a number that continues to grow. This has led to a situation where many young adults are forced to delay buying homes, potentially slowing the housing recovery. In fact, total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion, making it one of the largest debt bubbles in history.

The consequences of this crisis are far-reaching. With fewer young people entering the workforce, there is pressure on social security and medicare – two programs that will be severely impacted by the impending retirement crisis. Meanwhile, students who cannot qualify for a loan to buy their first home are left with no choice but to live in apartments or rely on family members.

The system has been designed to keep poor and middle-class families out of college, perpetuating a cycle of debt that is impossible to escape. With many institutions charging upwards of $40,000 per year in tuition and fees, the cost of higher education has become prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest students.

As the situation continues to deteriorate, it's clear that something needs

Student Debt Crisis Deepens

The United States is facing a growing student debt crisis, with the average college graduate now carrying nearly $18,000 in debt. This trend has been exacerbated by rising tuition costs, which have outpaced inflation in recent years.

A recent survey found that fewer students than ever believe taking on loans to attend college was worth it. In fact, only 59% of borrowers say that the benefits of their educational debt outweigh the downsides, a warning sign that if debt levels continue to rise, students may start shying away from universities or at least more expensive ones.

The consequences of this trend are far-reaching. Many students are forced to revamp their career goals to pay off their loans, and some are even questioning whether they should have borrowed so much money in the first place. This has led to a surge in loan defaults, with many borrowers struggling to make payments.

To address this issue, some universities are increasing financial aid packages to keep educational debt to a minimum. Meanwhile, loan companies are urging students to borrow less, wherever possible. However, for many students, loans have become an inescapable reality.

The situation is not unique to the United States. In other countries, similar issues with student debt and rising tuition costs are also being felt. The impact on individuals and families is significant, with many struggling to make ends meet or facing financial ruin.

As policymakers grapple with this issue, some experts argue that a more sustainable approach is needed. This could

In recent months, several high-profile cases have highlighted the tension between government agencies and individuals accused of crimes. A federal inmate, who was initially convicted on diminished charges, had his conviction overturned after a doppelganger was discovered to be the real perpetrator.

Meanwhile, a Danish historian and journalist, Lars Hedegaard, was fined for making statements deemed ""hate speech"" under Denmark's penal code. His case has sparked debate about freedom of expression and the limits of government overreach.

In another instance, a prisoner was sentenced to five years in prison after being forced by other inmates to attack a child-rape suspect who later died from injuries sustained during the altercation. The incident raised questions about the role of peer pressure in shaping individual behavior.

A more recent case involved a man who was arrested and charged with interfering with flight crew members after making threats on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles. His actions led to his arrest and subsequent release on bail.

In a surprising turn of events, a Miami businessman was awarded $7,645 in legal fees by a judge after prosecutors failed to correct false claims made against him by his ex-wife. The judge's scathing order highlighted the need for greater accountability within government agencies.

Lastly, a man named Adam Kokesh has been denied access to a lawyer and is being held without bail pending a probable cause hearing. His case has raised concerns about the treatment of individuals accused of crimes and the limits of government power.

These cases demonstrate that even in the most high-profile instances, government agencies must be held accountable for their actions and ensure that justice is served fairly and impartially.","Corruption Scandals Rock the Nation

A wave of corruption scandals has swept across the country, leaving a trail of deceit and betrayal in its wake. In Mississippi, a lawyer's son was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his role in a scheme to bribe a judge. The father, who had previously spearheaded legal settlements with tobacco firms, was also sentenced to five years in prison.

Meanwhile, in China, a former party boss has been convicted of corruption and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The case highlights the country's struggles with corruption, which have been ongoing for years.

In New York, a popular substitute teacher was fired from his job after conflicts arose at his school. His girlfriend described him as ""infuriated"" and ""preoccupied"" by the events that led to his dismissal.

On the other side of the country, a man who had been wrongly convicted of murder has settled with the city and state for $41 million. The case highlights the need for reform in the justice system.

In Indonesia, a former president is facing charges of corruption and graft over alleged theft of state money. The case is part of a broader effort to recover billions of dollars in stolen funds.

A former accountant at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities has pleaded guilty to nine criminal charges related to the Ponzi scheme that ruined investors worldwide.

In another development, Sotheby's and Amazon have announced plans to combine their online ventures into one site. The move comes after both companies were fined for price-fixing and other antitrust violations.

A lawyer in Washington state has been charged with campaign finance violations, allegedly concealing the source of thousands of dollars in political contributions.

Finally, a fugitive who had evaded capture for months was sentenced to prison after turning himself in. The case highlights the importance of law enforcement agencies working together to bring perpetrators to justice.

These cases demonstrate that corruption and deceit can occur anywhere, at any time.

Article 3 - inmate receives 5 years in prison for killing suspected child rapist
a jail inmate who beat a child-rape suspect who died a few days later was sentenced on wednesday to five years in prison. defendant zachary butler said he was forced to attack victim david piersol by other inmates who threatened to stab butler with sharpened pencils if he didn’t carry out the assault as the new kid on the jail block. he said he was told he had to “earn his tray,” referring to jail food trays. butler also said other inmates physically attacked piersol later in a jail bathroom, an allegation rejected by champaign county judge nick selvaggio for lack of evidence. “you don’t know with any certainty that other inmates were the ones that caused the blows to his head, do you?” the judge asked butler. “no, sir,” butler said. prosecutor kevin talebi also said there was no evidence of such an attack, with evidence showing butler struck piersol “several times” in the head with his knee. “what’s clear is this defendant is the one who caused the death,” talebi said. but the judge agreed that butler acted under “strong provocation” because of the inmate threats against him. butler also was fined $$1,500 and ordered to serve three years of probation after prison. butler said he was told to assault piersol after other inmates harassed piersol for several minutes, calling him a “child molester” who should be beaten up. source

Article 4 - doppelganger discovery leads to inmate being freed (video)
(before it's news) a kansas city man imprisoned for 17 years based on eye witness testimony was set free last week following the discovery of his doppelganger! since his conviction for aggravated robbery in 1999, richard jones continually proclaimed his innocence and insisted that authorities had gotten the wrong man. however, jones’ declarations fell on deaf ears until two years ago when he learned from his fellow inmates that there was another man in the prison who looked identical to him. through the help of the missouri innocence project, lawyers were able to locate this man, ricky lee amos, and they were stunned to discover that he was, indeed, jones’ doppelganger. not only were their faces and hair styles eerily similar, the two men also were approximately the same height and weight. further investigation revealed that amos’ former address had been linked to the crime by two men involved in the caper that sent jones to prison. how that detail was overlooked during the initial investigation seems to be a rather glaring error on the part of prosecutors. nonetheless, at a hearing last week, the original witnesses who had fingered jones were shown the booking photos of both men. not only did they conceded that they could not tell them apart, the victim of the crime now says that she believes it was amos who assaulted her and not jones. the remarkable breakthrough was enough to convince a judge that jones had been wrongfully convicted of the crime

A growing number of military veterans are speaking out about the pervasive culture of corruption and silence within the US military. Despite efforts to address the issue, the problem persists, with many cases going unreported or unpunished.

One of the most egregious examples is the recent scandal at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, where instructors were found to have engaged in illicit encounters with trainees. The investigation revealed a lack of oversight and leadership gaps that allowed the abuse to continue for years.

Meanwhile, a new plan announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel aims to tackle the scourge of sexual assault within the military. However, critics argue that the plan prioritizes cases involving female service members assaulting male counterparts, rather than addressing the broader issue of rape and assault more broadly.

The problem is not limited to individual incidents, but rather reflects a deeper cultural issue within the military. A recent study found that 3.3% of men had experienced unwanted sexual contact since joining the military, with only 302 cases resulting in prosecutions.

As one veteran noted, ""the military is not the YMCA. It's something special."" But for many service members, the experience can be traumatic and devastating.

The issue is further complicated by a lack of transparency and accountability within the military. A recent report revealed that the Pentagon had released its own report on the 2014 Gaza war, which was criticized for downplaying Palestinian fatalities and damage.

As one commentator noted, ""the power to make war has never required an official declaration... The courts have upheld these distinctions."" However, the reality is that many cases of military violence are not formally declared or prosecuted.

The problem is also reflected in the broader cultural context. A recent incident at a Delaware restaurant highlighted the issue of service animals being denied entry based on their presence. The woman who sparked outrage by screaming at a veteran with his service dog has since defended her actions, claiming that anyone who disagrees with her is a racist.

As one observer noted, ""the internet never forgets."" The incident serves as a reminder that the military must do better to address the issue of sexual assault and harassment, and to promote a culture of respect and accountability.","Military Sexual Assault: A Complex Issue with Unaddressed Victims

A growing awareness of the issue has led to increased efforts to curb military sexual assault. Recent months have seen intense debates on Capitol Hill, as well as a new documentary shedding light on male victims of sexual assault in the military.

Advocates argue that the problem is not solely due to an increase in female service members, but rather a culture that tolerates and often ignores sexual violence. The Department of Defense has acknowledged this issue and is working to develop plans to encourage more men to report incidents.

However, concerns persist about the effectiveness of these efforts. A recent survey found that antigay bias is common among military personnel, with many reporting instances of harassment and intimidation.

The Pentagon's handling of sexual assault has been criticized by advocacy groups, who point out that the institution often fails to support victims. In some cases, perpetrators have faced lenient punishments or even been acquitted.

Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, but progress is slow. The military's justice system has been criticized for its bias towards senior officers and its failure to prosecute serial predators.

As the issue continues to gain attention, it remains clear that addressing military sexual assault requires a multifaceted approach. Simply changing military culture may not be enough; more drastic measures, such as prosecution and incarceration of perpetrators, are needed to create a safer environment for all service members.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - military rape survivors call on congress to stop the silent epidemic
today a group of veterans delivered letters signed by 200 military sexual assault and rape survivors to congress urging them to pass the stop act. the letters were presented to congresswoman spier who introduced the act to congress in november of 2011. if passed, the stop act would remove the reporting of sexual assault and rape in the military outside of the chain of command and into the jurisdiction of the military’s sexual assault oversight and response office which is comprised of military and civilian experts. despite 17 congressional hearings over the past 25 years, there’s been no major action taken to stem the “silent epidemic” of sexual assault in the military. it’s been estimated that nearly 20,000 servicemembers were assaulted in 2010 though only a little more than 13 percent of the incidents were reported. the group of women delivered the letters with the human rights organization, protect our defenders, which provides support for men and women who have served in the military and been victims of sexual assault. a number of the women who went to congress today were featured in the documentary, “the invisible war,” a film which gives voice to the staggering number of horrific sexual assaults that have gone unpunished. the letter was from: “200 veterans who have been raped or sexually assaulted at least once while serving in the united states armed forces between 1971 – 2011. retaliation, including discharge and punishment, happened to many of us who tried reporting the crime.” many victims say that the way

root of military scandals: sexual attraction, power and money (before it's news) a fractured command culture that included a lack of oversight and what an air forceinvestigation called a “leadership gap” helped fuel a sex scandal at joint base san antonio-lackland involving instructors and trainees. the investigation, unveiled today at a pentagonbriefing, said barriers “at nearly every level” limited the flow of information about instructor misconduct. while leaders often were disconnected from training, instructors put in punishing hours — starting their days before 3 a.m. and leaving for home after 9 that night. there weren’t enough of them to go around and not enough supervision, a toxic mix that set the stage for abuses that included a basic training instructor given 20 years in prison last summer for illicit encounters with 10 women, one of them a rape victim. “most of what we found in bmt is not new,” gen.edward rice jr., head of the air force’s training command, said in a report that outlined actions to be taken because of the scandal. “sexual attraction, power, and money are three of the most corruptive elements of the human condition, and two of these three are present in the (basic training) environment. readmorehere

Article 6 - (un)limiting war: “perpetual war” in historical perspective
(un)limiting war: “perpetual war” in historical perspective (before it's news) small wars, overseas expeditions, and punitive raiding are endemic throughout u.s. history. from the outset of the republic, america began grappling with conflicts of tenuous definition and purpose. the constitution, despite vesting congress with the power to declare war, was never particularly clear on what constituted adequate legislative justification, nor did it seek to deny the executive leeway over military initiative. the power to make war, in the event of hostile aggression, remained with the executive. additionally, far from being a vaunted tradition, the power to declare war has never required an official declaration of war to authorize military action. indeed, this is the exception rather than the norm. beyond the many naval actions conducted without any substantial congressional writ, there is, beginning with the quasi-war and the barbary wars, a long tradition of congressional authorizations for war that are not formal declarations. from the quasi-war to the iraq war, the courts have upheld these distinction. yet there is clearly a large distinction between landing bluejackets against ports hosting pirates and privateers and today’s prolonged, massive targeted killing campaigns, at least in scale and scope. in logic, they are not so dissimilar. in the case of naval landings and punitive expeditions to defend american citizens and commerce abroad, the executive invoked unilateral prerogatives of national self-defense, or else the implicit (through congressional maintenance of

Article 8 - military investigates female-on-male sexual assaults
washington — defense secretary chuck hagel has unveiled a controversial new plan that he says will spur military leaders to confront the “scourge” of sexual assaults amongst armed service members. instead of caving to demands for an independent military legal authority, hagel announced that commanders would take charge of sexual assault investigations by prioritizing cases in which female service members were alleged to have sexually assaulted their male counterparts. “it’s all about piquing the interest of our high-level commanders, who find female-on-male cases more stimulating,” said hagel. “the fact is that most commanders just don’t take sexual assault seriously, but they were enthusiastic about investigating cases of servicewomen taking charge, so to speak.” earlier this week, president obama voiced his support for the new disciplinary guidelines in front of marines at camp pendleton. in his remarks, the president said that “no military unit can succeed without discipline, without trust and without cohesion.” “oh, i wouldn’t worry about our, uh, units succeeding,” said hagel. according to a defense department study, 3.3 percent of men had experienced “unwanted sexual contact … since joining the military, by someone in the military.” of the estimated 26,000 cases of assault last year, only 302 garnered prosecutions. the cases have incited lawmakers to demand changes to the military-justice system, with some suggesting that the military chain of command should no longer hold jurisdiction over sexual-ass

Article 9 - woman who screamed at veteran and his service dog just got a nasty surprise when she woke up this morning
recently in a delaware restaurant, a woman completely lost her mind when she violently screamed at a military veteran for bringing his service dog with him into the eating establishment. in the video, which has now gone viral, the woman now identified as ciara miller, becomes increasingly violent and belligerent as she argues that it is disgusting for this military veteran to have his service dog with him in the restaurant. ms. miller’s husband can be seen in the video standing helplessly by as his wife disrespects this brave military veteran along with all the other customers in the restaurant trying to enjoy their meal. ciara miller is now responding to the numerous arguments denouncing her behavior, claiming that anyone who disagrees with her is a racist. ms. miller’s behavior was nothing short of disgusting. as the service animal entered the restaurant, she began her profanity-laced tirade, using all sorts of language that can’t be repeated here. the entire video can be seen below. ciara miller would be wise to understand that her ignorance is on full display for the world, and the internet never forgets. what this triggered liberal race-baiter fails to understand is that it is a federal crime to deny entry to someone based on them having a service animal. in an unbelievable display, ciara miller appeared on fox 4, defending her actions, and her profanity laced tirade. her excuse for her abhorrent behavior goes like this,

Article 1 - in debate over military sexual assault, men are overlooked victims
but in recent months, intense efforts on capitol hill to curb military sexual assault, and the release of a new documentary about male sexual assault victims in the military, “justice denied,” have brought new attention to male victims. advocates say their plight shows that sexual assault has risen not because there are more women in the ranks but because sexual violence is often tolerated. “i think telling the story about male victims is the key to changing the culture of the military,” said anu k. bhagwati, executive director of the service women’s action network, an advocacy group that has sharply criticized the pentagon’s handling of sexual assault. “i think it places the onus on the institution when people realize it’s also men who are victims.” the department of defense says it is developing plans to encourage more men to report the crime. “a focus of our prevention efforts over the next several months is specifically geared towards male survivors and will include why male survivors report at much lower rates than female survivors, and determining the unique support and assistance male survivors need,” cynthia o. smith, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. in interviews, nearly a dozen current and former service members who said they were sexually assaulted in the military described fearing that they would be punished, ignored or ridiculed if they reported the attacks. most said that before 2011, when the ban on openly gay service members was repealed, they believed they would have been discharged if they admitted having sexual contact — even unwanted

midwest kansas: court approves school funding plan the state supreme court has signed off on a new education funding law that increases state aid to poor school districts. the justices issued a brief order tuesday saying that the legislature “has currently satisfied” the court’s orders on education funding by approving the measure last week. the decision ends a threat that public schools would be shut down after thursday. gov. sam brownback, a republican, signed the school finance measure into law on monday. lawyers for the state and lawyers for four school districts that had sued the state submitted a joint statement saying that the measure complied with the court’s dictates. the justices ruled last month that the funding system remained unfair to poor school districts. (ap) rockies colorado: adultery ban called discriminatory lawyers for an air force officer charged with rape, adultery and other crimes are making the novel argument that the military ban on extramarital sex discriminates against heterosexuals because it does not specifically include same-sex couples. lawyers for col. eugene caughey of the air force challenged the adultery provision monday in a military court at peterson air force base. they argued that the half-dozen adultery charges against colonel caughey should be thrown out because they violate his constitutional rights. military prosecutors argued the adultery ban does apply to same-sex couples. the judge has not ruled on the argument. colonel caughey is charged with raping a woman at schriever air force base, also in colorado

Article 3 - south korean military sentences captain for sex with other servicemen
“what counts is their service, not their sexuality,” she added. ms. rife said south korea should repeal an “archaic and discriminatory” provision in its military criminal act that outlaws sex between gay soldiers and to “get up to date when it comes to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex people.” the south korean military criminal code outlaws sodomy and other unspecified “disgraceful conduct” between servicemen, whether or not there is mutual consent and whether or not that conduct takes place in or outside military compounds. those found to have violated the act face up to two years in prison. in south korea, the rights of sexual minorities are a largely taboo and politically unpopular subject. in recent years, powerful right-wing christian groups have intensified a campaign against homosexuality, scuttling a bill that would have given sexual minorities the same protections as other minority groups. during his presidential campaign, the country’s newly elected leader, moon jae-in, a human rights lawyer and liberal, disappointed rights groups who have otherwise supported him by saying that he opposed homosexuality and same-sex marriage. the captain was arrested on april 13, as the army was ferreting out dozens of soldiers suspected of having same-sex relationships in what rights groups said was a campaign against gay men in the 620,000-member military. at least 32 faced criminal charges of violating the military criminal act, according to the domestic news media and lawyers and rights advocates

Article 4 - negotiators reach compromise on defense bill
the way the pentagon deal was struck reflected the dysfunction that has marked the current congress. negotiators from the house and senate armed services committees found common ground on the sprawling measure even though a senate version had yet to pass, and some senate republicans were furious that they once again had been denied the right to offer multiple amendments. it was not immediately clear that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, would go along, although with the military’s ability to issue combat and hazard pay set to expire dec. 31, pressure to act will be great. but in the strange first session of the 113th congress, precedent has rarely held, and in a legislative year that is likely to go down in history as the least productive ever, monday’s accord on defense policy was something of a victory for congress. “this isn’t the way we’d like to do it,” said senator james m. inhofe of oklahoma, the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee. “it’s the only way we could do it.” the house passed its annual pentagon policy bill this summer, but the senate’s version has been pending for weeks, bogged down in a dispute over the number of republican amendments that would be allowed to come to a vote. as republican and democratic leaders battled over procedure, the house and senate armed services committees negotiated behind the scenes on a compromise bill. the measure is the first change to law governing sexual assault in the military in

Article 5 - survey of troops finds antigay bias common in service
investigators surveyed a random sampling of 71,570 officers and enlisted personnel at 38 military bases and aboard 11 warships and submarines in the united states and overseas. the survey did not question people at fort campbell, where pfc. barry winchell was bludgeoned to death last july with a baseball bat. the army's inspector general is conducting a separate investigation into why commanders there ignored reports that soldiers had openly taunted private winchell about his sexual orientation for months. the survey's findings surprised many senior officials at the pentagon, who had publicly played down the extent of harassment only a few months ago. scrambling to respond, mr. cohen appointed a committee of civilian and military officials to review the findings. mr. cohen ordered the committee, which will be headed by the under secretary of the air force, carol dibattiste, to report back to him by the end of july with plans for dealing with what the pentagon's spokesman, kenneth h. bacon, acknowledged was ''a disturbing amount'' of harassment in the ranks. the survey's findings have focused new attention on the clinton administration's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which congress put into law in 1993 after a fierce political battle. the policy allows gay men and women to serve in the military as long as they keep their sexual orientation to themselves and do not engage in homosexual acts, but it still bars openly gay people from serving in

Article 6 - the end of ‘don’t ask’
to the editor: in your discussion of our new u.c.l.a. study on the end of “don’t ask, don’t tell” (“a military success story,” editorial, sept. 16), you mention that we largely attribute the “smooth transition” to openly gay service to the pentagon’s successful “implementation and training process.” but this is actually a small part of the story. as we concluded, it is true that the commitment of top military leaders to get behind this change was critical and that resistance could have created needless bumps in the road. but the biggest reason the policy worked so well is that there was no cause for alarm in the first place. as i chronicle in my book, “unfriendly fire,” the notion that military readiness was ever threatened by openly gay service was exaggerated by some in military circles, along with social and political conservatives, who were morally opposed to equality. the research, including in dozens of foreign countries, never justified this concern. the lesson here is less about the importance of military leadership and more about the risks of deferring to ungrounded claims that equality is harmful to our major institutions and to society itself. it’s not incidental that this is precisely the same ungrounded claim people now make to oppose the right of gay people to marry. nathaniel frank new york, sept. 17, 2012 the writer, a co-author of the u.c.l.a. study, “one year out,” is a visiting scholar

Article 7 - israel: dissident reservists dismissed
the military on monday terminated the service of 43 reservists from an elite intelligence unit who in september signed a letter refusing to participate in “actions against palestinians” for moral reasons. the letter by veterans of the clandestine unit 8200 claimed that its work harmed innocent people, amounted to “political persecution,” and made it more difficult to resolve the underlying conflict. the military said that the refusal violated its “standards and morals,” and questioned why the complaint was aired publicly rather than through the chain of command. the military “views with great severity any attempt to elude mandatory military service especially when the act is intended to make a political statement,” its statement said. a leader of the reservists’ group, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the military prohibits members of 8200 from being identified publicly, said “the army is trying to make the issues that we were trying to raise go away by making us go away.”

(liberty university also teaches young earth creationism, which is the belief that god created the universe, earth and life in the last 10,000 years.) the hiring of mccaw has also proved contentious. as the university’s facebook page filled up with angry comments, falwell felt compelled to offer explanations on the university’s website. he said liberty had conducted an “investigation.” it found that mccaw was a fine man. far from being pushed out of baylor, falwell said, mccaw’s “decision to

Article 10 - don’t trust the pentagon to end rape
los angeles — the senate armed services committee will hold a hearing today on sexual assault in the military. this comes after months of revelations of rapes and other violent attacks at military bases and academies. at the hearing, the chiefs of staff of the military branches will likely admit that there is a serious problem and insist that the solution involves changing military culture. but the challenge goes far deeper. the military has a problem with embedded, serial sexual predators. according to a 2011 report from the pentagon’s sexual assault and prevention office, 90 percent of military rapes are committed by men with previous histories of assault. these predators select and befriend lower-ranking victims; often they ply their victims with alcohol or drugs and assault them when they are unconscious. in my film “the invisible war,” a retired brigadier general, loree k. sutton, describes the military as a “target-rich environment” for serial predators. the training and leadership efforts the pentagon proposes won’t change this environment. it simply isn’t possible to “train” or “lead” serial predators not to rape. there is a way to stop these predators: we should prosecute and incarcerate them. but here the military fails entirely. advertisement continue reading the main story though the defense department estimates that there were 26,000 sexual assaults in the military last year, fewer than 1 percent resulted in a court-martial conviction. why? there is a deep institutional bias in the military’s justice system; senior officers

Title: what will it take to stop rape in the military?
Content: to the editor: re “don’t trust the pentagon to end rape,” by kirby dick (op-ed, june 4): the point is well taken that “the military cannot — and will not — fix this problem on its own.” while senator kirsten e. gillibrand’s bill, which would remove decision-making from the military chain of command and remove the disincentive to report crimes, should be supported by all who care about justice and the personal security of service personnel, it will not fix the problem either. sexual violence is a part of war and has been throughout history. to end rape in and by the military, in and out of armed conflict, requires a transformation of the military and the end to war that president john f. kennedy called for before the 1961 general assembly. betty a. reardon new york, june 4, 2013 the writer, founding director of the international institute on peace education, is the author of “sexism and the war system.” advertisement continue reading the main story to the editor: re “joint chiefs’ answers on sex crimes dismay senators” (news article, june 5): on july 26, 1948, president harry s. truman signed executive order 9981. from that date forward, the armed forces of the united states were colorblind. decades ahead of the larger american society, minorities in our armed forces enjoyed the same rights as anyone else in the services.

Military Scandals Exposed: A Culture of Corruption and Silence

A growing number of military veterans are speaking out about the pervasive culture of corruption and silence within the US military. Despite efforts to address the issue, the problem persists, with many cases going unreported or unpunished.

One of the most egregious examples is the recent scandal at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, where instructors were found to have engaged in illicit encounters with trainees. The investigation revealed a lack of oversight and leadership gaps that allowed the abuse to continue for years.

Meanwhile, a new plan announced by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel aims to tackle the scourge of sexual assault within the military. However, critics argue that the plan prioritizes cases involving female service members assaulting male counterparts, rather than addressing the broader issue of rape and assault more broadly.

The problem is not limited to individual incidents, but rather reflects a deeper cultural issue within the military. A recent study found that 3.3% of men had experienced unwanted sexual contact since joining the military, with only 302 cases resulting in prosecutions.

As one veteran noted, ""the military is not the YMCA. It's something special."" But for many service members, the experience can be traumatic and devastating.

The issue is further complicated by a lack of transparency and accountability within the military. A recent report revealed that the Pentagon had released its own report on the 2014 Gaza war, which was criticized for downplaying Palestinian fatalities and damage.

Military Sexual Assault: A Complex Issue with Unaddressed Victims

A growing awareness of the issue has led to increased efforts to curb military sexual assault. Recent months have seen intense debates on Capitol Hill, as well as a new documentary shedding light on male victims of sexual assault in the military.

Advocates argue that the problem is not solely due to an increase in female service members, but rather a culture that tolerates and often ignores sexual violence. The Department of Defense has acknowledged this issue and is working to develop plans to encourage more men to report incidents.

However, concerns persist about the effectiveness of these efforts. A recent survey found that antigay bias is common among military personnel, with many reporting instances of harassment and intimidation.

The Pentagon's handling of sexual assault has been criticized by advocacy groups, who point out that the institution often fails to support victims. In some cases, perpetrators have faced lenient punishments or even been acquitted.

Efforts to address these issues are ongoing, but progress is slow. The military's justice system has been criticized for its bias towards senior officers and its failure to prosecute serial predators.

As the issue continues to gain attention, it remains clear that addressing military sexual assault requires a multifaceted approach. Simply changing military culture may not be enough; more drastic measures, such as prosecution and incarceration of perpetrators, are needed to create a safer environment for all service members.

The precious metal market has been abuzz with silver's remarkable price surge, leaving many investors wondering why it hasn't outperformed its gold counterpart. For years, silver bulls have lamented the metal's failure to significantly outperform gold in this bull market.

However, recent data suggests that a paradigm shift may be underway. Silver's dwindling warehouse inventories and stagnant production with increasing demand indicate a growing imbalance in the market. The annual sales of the American Silver Eagle, which is only one silver investment vehicle available, now exceed yearly U.S. domestic silver production.

Industry experts point to the metal's versatility as a conductor of electricity, driving demand from tech and industrial companies worldwide. With global industrial demand for silver expected to increase 36% by 2015, coupled with tight supply, prices are poised to rise.

Some analysts believe that the next silver bull market may have already started, driven by fundamental factors such as growing shortages and undervalued prices. Others warn of a potential bubble burst, citing the metal's industrial nature and consumption patterns.

Despite the uncertainty, one thing is clear: silver's price surge shows no signs of slowing down. As investors continue to seek safe havens in times of economic turmoil, silver's value is likely to appreciate further. Whether it reaches triple-digit prices remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – the silver market is on the cusp of a significant shift.","Gold Prices Soar Amid Uncertainty

The precious metal has seen a significant surge in recent weeks, with prices reaching their highest levels in over a year. The rally is attributed to a combination of factors, including the uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election and the expected increase in interest rates.

Investors have been seeking refuge in gold as a safe-haven asset, driving up demand for physical bars and coins. The metal has also benefited from a weaker dollar, which makes it cheaper for users of other currencies.

Despite concerns about inflation, driven by President-elect Donald Trump's plans to boost infrastructure spending, investors remain bullish on gold. Analysts predict that prices will continue to rise, with some forecasting a price of $1,140 per ounce by the second quarter of next year.

The surge in gold prices has also been fueled by speculation, with many investors betting against the metal. However, physical demand has been picking up, cushioning the fall and providing support for prices.

As the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet later this month, markets are anticipating a decision on interest rates. A hike is expected, which could have negative implications for gold prices. Nevertheless, the metal remains a popular choice among investors seeking safe-haven assets.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - a coming paradigm shift in silver?
a coming paradigm shift in silver? (before it's news) for years, silver bulls have lamented the metal’s failure to significantly outperform gold in this precious metals bull market. they look at the statistics: silver’s dwindling warehouse inventories, only a fraction of what they were a few decades ago; no huge government stockpiles of silver overhanging the market; stagnant production with increasing demand; announcements of new uses released almost daily; annual sales of the american silver eagle, which is only one silver investment vehicle available, now exceeding yearly u.s. domestic silver production; the us a net importer silver as domestic production meets only about one third of demand. why, silver bulls ask, has the price of silver not outstripped the price of gold? in past bull markets, most notably the 1973-1980 bull market, the price of silver shot up 25 times while the price of gold rose only seven to eight times. significant in the 1970s precious metals bull market was the “hunt brothers” factor; this bull market does not have such a recognized development. still, in other bull markets of shorter duration, silver significantly outperformed gold. so, why not now? steve st. angelo provides some of the answers in his article the coming paradigm shift in silver. a paradigm shift comes with a radical change in the thinking of a large number of people. it is a mass psychology phenomenon. the housing boom is a perfect example.

Article 2 - silver spikes and corrections
silver spikes and corrections (before it's news) silver continues its powerful and relentless move higher. from august 2010 until now this is the biggest rally during this silver bull market that started early last decade. silver has also been the star performer of the financial world over the past year as you can see on the graph below. how does this current silver spike compare to the past? the next chart shows the major moves higher in silver during this bull market in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, and the current rally. also shown is the rate of change in price appreciation on a 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month time frame. interestingly, the 1-month rate of change shows that at the end of each rally, silver had it’s biggest monthly gain of the entire move. right now silver is close to putting in its biggest monthly gain of this rally and has a week yet to go in april. silver would have to gain more than 25% during this month though to eclipse it’s biggest month to date which occurred in 2009. on a 3-month and 12-month time frame this is clearly the biggest gain of this silver bull to date, but on a 6-month time frame it is still in the same ballpark as the silver rally in 2006. i noted in a recent article that we’ve still yet to see a big increase in speculation in the gold market along

freefall in silver, what's next? (before it's news) based on the may 6th, 2011 premium update. visit our archives for more gold & silver analysis. silver was one of the top priorities for many of precious metal traders until last week. however, silver market witnessed a dramatic turbulence in recent days. let’s examine what has happened in silver market, in detail. two weeks of gains for silver were erased in only 11 minutes this monday as markets opened for electronic trading in asia with prices falling as much as 12 per cent in the session. spot gold fell 2.2% in 40 minutes. on wednesday prices took another hit on a newspaper report that high-profile investors, including george soros’ hedge fund, have sold precious metals. silver for july delivery closed lower by 7.5%, at $$39.39 an ounce on the comex division of the new york a freefall situation! but, none of this caught our readers by surprise. we warned on friday that silver was vulnerable for a washout on the downside. we wrote: the situation in silver is extremely tense at this time. it seems that we are near an important top, although we may see higher prices for the next several days/weeks before it is reached. most traders should not attempt to take advantage of this rally, for it could be difficult to exit quickly if the situation becomes very volatile. such will be the case if a multi-dollar

Article 5 - where now for gold and silver?
where now for gold and silver? (before it's news) david a. banister – www.markettrendforecast.com well, that was fun wasn’t it gang? a huge drop in silver from $$49.75 to the $$32 ranges after 8 months of rallying from 19 to near 50. a 150% gain in silver in eight fibonacci months, sounds like a pretty overbought situation. gold in the same time frame lagged badly, but all of that was predicted by me late last august due to the consolidating “b wave” in silver that was preceding what i felt would be a “massive rally” in the metal. quite simply i said, investors will view silver as “cheap” relative to gold and they will buy it instead of gold. i realize that makes no logical sense, but since when are the herd behaviors ever logical? what everyone wants to know still is what is next for both gold and silver in their bull markets? when dealing with human behavioral patterns, it’s as much art as science, so i do my best to ferret out the coming pivot highs and lows, and here is where i am at right now: gold should work higher in a current “5th wave up” from the $$1462 pivot lows to a bogey target of $$1627, and once that is hit or close investors should be enjoying rallies in the gold and silver stocks but looking to trim back positions aggressively assuming i’m right. where

Article 6 - this precious metals ratio signals a big move ahead: “we will ultimately see triple digit silver prices”
this precious metals ratio signals a big move ahead: “we will ultimately see triple digit silver prices” headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! earlier this year, as investors around the world panicked and stock markets crashed across the board, one asset class held strong and actually gained. it was, by all accounts, a capital flow panic out of broader stocks and into precious metals. as a safe haven, precious metals like gold and silver have long been sought by a panicked populace during times of crisis and given the current economic and monetary debacle created by central banks, we can safely forecast a continued rise over coming years for this reason alone. but according to keith neumeyer, there is another key reason for why we could see explosive prices, specifically in silver, because major shortages loom and current valuations for the precious metal are nowhere near where they should be. given his experience and current position as the ceo of billion-dollar mining company first majestic silver and chairman of mineral bank first mining finance, there is no better source for understanding what’s happening in silver markets today and where we can expect them to go in the mid to long-term. as neumeyer notes in his latest interview with the daily coin, gold is currently selling for about 75 times the price of an ounce of silver, but from a mining and production standpoint, the physical ratio is about 10-to-1. coupled with growing global supply shortages for this essential metal, that means prices for

the next silver bull market may have already started % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) there are fundamentals. and then there is legalized betting, ultimately backed by you, the tax payer. otherwise known as speculative trades. modern day commodity prices are determined by the latter, rather than by the result of trading based on the former. as silver prices bounce along the bottom of a four-year dismal performance range, suddenly it becomes nationalize news. everyone likes to see the aftermath of a train wreck. from the bearish nonsense emanating from the mainstream press, to the evergreen bullishness of the alternative – ‘pro-gold and silver’ publishers, too few acknowledge the true depths of these broken markets. both are careful to present the array of so-called fundamentals to justify their assumptions. and yet evidence for why prices are the way they are – and why they will eventually return from whence they came is ignored almost as a matter of routine. bill bonner and friends recently provided some commentary from inside bullish side. while much of what is presented is not far from the (fundamental) mark, these factors do little to indicate manifestation in current price. the next silver bull market may have already started http://bonnerandpartners.com/the-next-silver-bull-market-may-have-already-started/ silver is down 7.1% this year. will this weakness persist? to find out, let’s look at the key factors in

has the silver bubble finally burst? is silver investing a bad idea? (before it's news) +hans schoff wrote: silver investing has gotten a lot of press lately with silver’s amazing run up over the past eight months and even more so since february, making it a good market for creating wealth for some (and preserving wealth for others). pundits all over the main stream media had been calling for the silver (and especially gold, with it’s 10 year run) bubble to burst and for the market to come crashing back down… from an incredible high of near 50, the market finally did correct sharply… but it has not crashed, nor have the fundamentals for silver investing changed. to understand both the gold and silver investing markets, you have to understand the macro economic picture, the big picture. silver is an industrial commodity, meaning that it not only has monetary properties due to it’s intrinsic nature and rarity among other things, but it is also used industrially in everything from cell phones, street lights, computers, solar panels and all sorts of consumer electronics. therefore it is a metal that is consumed (and in such small quantities per application it makes recycling the metal impractical in most instances), which reduces the supply over time which puts upward pressure on it’s value (if there’s less of something it becomes more valuable). gold is more a store of value and is mostly used as jewelery and as a backup for real money. it is one of the best (

Article 9 - the trend is still downward for silver
the trend is still downward for silver (before it's news) bob kirtley: the euphoria that heralded the summer rally in silver prices has now dissipated and is as good as dead as silver prices drift lower. silver made a valiant attempt to breach the $$25.00 level in august but could not maintain its momentum and has since drifted lower to trade at around $$21.00/oz today. its big sister, gold, has also ran out of steam having peaked at around $$1420/oz, it is now struggling to get above $$1300/oz level. since the heady days of almost $$50.00/oz, silver has suffered through a number of false dawns with this summer’s effort now sadly joining that list of failed attempts to rally and challenge old highs. we are aware that the demand for physical silver is alive and well and needed for such industrial purposes as solar panels and that various mints around the world are from time to time sold out of their offerings of silver bars and coins for investment purposes. we are also aware of the paper market, as represented by the comex, frequently suffers from sellers who dump large amounts of paper contracts at odd times throughout the trading day, thus sending prices lower. we can shout about this situation all day long but we do not have the power to change it and investing against it has been a disaster for some. as gold and silver bulls we need to recognize that nothing goes up in a straight

Article 1 - gold sleeps while silver rocks
gold is not having a good year, but its poor cousin, silver, is doing nicely. silver ended last week at $7.31 an ounce, up 7.4 percent for the year. gold was at $419.80 an ounce, down 4.2 percent in 2005. the main reason for the differing performances is that silver is more of an industrial commodity, while gold still has its monetary and safe-harbor allure. that means economic growth is good for silver while a stronger dollar -- up 7.8 percent against the euro this year -- is bad for gold. but there is another reason for the performance disparity: speculators seem more interested in silver than gold these days. the number of futures contracts that are betting on a higher gold price and that are owned by interests generally outside the precious-metals industry, including speculators, has fallen sharply, according to data from the commodity futures trading commission. bets on a lower gold price, however, have doubled in the last month. betting on silver has slowed, but betting against silver has dropped more. advertisement continue reading the main story philip klapwijk, executive chairman of gfms of london, which wrote the world silver survey 2005 that was released last week by the silver institute, warned that the tilt toward silver by speculators may not be enough to keep silver above $7 an ounce.

(express photo: arul horizon) the government’s announcement that rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes in circulation would cease to be legal tenders has hit businesses and trades that are largely cash-based. across the country, impact was felt at offices of sub-registrars as a number of those who turned up for registration of their properties were unable to go through with the transactions due to their inability to purchase stamp papers. it was a different story in the bullion market. gold prices headed northwards on a combination of factors — the clampdown on black money domestically and the election results in the us, with experts predicting that prices of the yellow metal will remain firm going forward. watch what else is making news the sudden halt in registration of properties on wednesday was felt across the country. a property dealer in a city in eastern uttar pradesh said, “as a daily routine, i went to the registrar’s office, but today not a single registration happened as people could not purchase stamp papers for the same.” stamp papers can be bought by individuals from either government office or from licenced stamp vendors and in most cases it is done though cash. “as the existing high-value cash denominations can’t be used to buy stamp papers, one is required to purchase through cheques.

gold snaps biggest 3-day drop in a year as trump fallout eases eddie van der walt and ranjeetha pakiam nov 16, 2016 1:13 am et (bloomberg) -- gold snapped its biggest three-day drop in more than a year amid signs that prices fell too far, too fast and as the dollar weakened. bullion’s 4.4 percent slump in the previous three days pushed its 14-day relative-strength index below 30, signaling to some traders and analysts that prices were oversold. the metal also rose on tuesday as the dollar fell for the first time since last week’s u.s. presidential election, treasury yields dropped from this year’s high and base metals slipped. after initially jumping on haven demand following donald trump’s surprise election win, gold then plunged as the president-elect’s pledge to cut taxes and boost infrastructure spending sent the dollar and industrial metals higher. because those plans may lead to faster growth, traders are almost certain that the federal reserve will raise u.s. interest rates next month, curbing the appeal of owning gold, which doesn’t provide any yield. “things are a little bit quieter, but the market’s still very jumpy and nervous,” david govett, head of precious metals trading at marex spectron group ltd. in london, said by e-mail. “i think we have seen enough on the downside for the time being unless the dollar rallies massively.” bullion for immediate

Content: silver bull seasonals 2 (before it's news) adam hamilton, cpa september 14, 2012 silver is mined year-round at a fairly constant rate across the globe. thus it is somewhat counterintuitive that this metal would exhibit marked seasonal tendencies tied to the calendar. but it sure does. unlike the agricultural commodities, silver’s seasonality is driven by fluctuations in demand rather than supply. and silver is just entering its strongest time of the year, which is very bullish for it and its miners’ stocks. the primary driver of silver price action is gold. the vast majority of the time with few exceptions, silver’s fortunes are closely slaved to gold’s. investors and speculators are only likely to plow capital into silver and drive up its price rapidly when gold is thriving. gold strength naturally stokes greed for the highly-speculative white metal. and later when gold corrects, traders are quick to abandon silver in sympathy. today’s secular silver bull was born way back in november 2001, when silver traded near $$4 per ounce (and gold under $$275). since then, silver has catapulted a breathtaking 1105% higher at best as of its latest major high in april 2011! the gains prudent contrarians like our subscribers have won in this sector have been epic beyond belief. but traders can’t forget gold truly is the key to thriving in silver. from silver’s humble beginnings over a decade ago to this week, the daily close in silver has had a 92% correlation r-square with the daily close in gold. this means that 92% of silver’s price action in its entire secular bull is statistically explainable by gold’s own. 92%! so why does silver exhibit such strong seasonality? simply because gold does. silver follows and amplifies moves in gold, both up and down. gold’s own seasonality is driven by massive fluctuations in global investment demand. there are times of the calendar year when major income-cycle and cultural factors ignite huge surges in gold demand in various world regions. because silver so closely mirrors gold, understanding and successfully trading its seasonality is impossible without first studying gold’s. and that discussion is well beyond today’s scope. but i’ve been doing extensive gold-seasonals research for many years, so if you need to get up to speed simply read my latest essay on that thread. from asian harvest to indian wedding season to western holiday buying to chinese new year, gold’s seasonal drivers of outsized investment demand are well understood. and silver’s seasonality is merely a speculation-motivated extension of gold’s own. traditional seasonality studies used by futures traders encompass multi-decade timeframes, often 30 years. while hammering out so much data certainly has merit in forging pure seasonality, i prefer an alternative approach. prices obviously behave quite differently in secular bulls and bears. and we are trading a secular silver bull today. so the most practical seasonality for trading is silver

Silver's Price Surge: A Paradigm Shift?

The precious metal market has been abuzz with silver's remarkable price surge, leaving many investors wondering why it hasn't outperformed its gold counterpart. For years, silver bulls have lamented the metal's failure to significantly outperform gold in this bull market.

However, recent data suggests that a paradigm shift may be underway. Silver's dwindling warehouse inventories and stagnant production with increasing demand indicate a growing imbalance in the market. The annual sales of the American Silver Eagle, which is only one silver investment vehicle available, now exceed yearly U.S. domestic silver production.

Industry experts point to the metal's versatility as a conductor of electricity, driving demand from tech and industrial companies worldwide. With global industrial demand for silver expected to increase 36% by 2015, coupled with tight supply, prices are poised to rise.

Some analysts believe that the next silver bull market may have already started, driven by fundamental factors such as growing shortages and undervalued prices. Others warn of a potential bubble burst, citing the metal's industrial nature and consumption patterns.

Despite the uncertainty, one thing is clear: silver's price surge shows no signs of slowing down. As investors continue to seek safe havens in times of economic turmoil, silver's value is likely to appreciate further. Whether it reaches triple-digit prices remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – the silver market is on the cusp of a significant shift.

Gold Prices Soar Amid Uncertainty

The precious metal has seen a significant surge in recent weeks, with prices reaching their highest levels in over a year. The rally is attributed to a combination of factors, including the uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election and the expected increase in interest rates.

Investors have been seeking refuge in gold as a safe-haven asset, driving up demand for physical bars and coins. The metal has also benefited from a weaker dollar, which makes it cheaper for users of other currencies.

Despite concerns about inflation, driven by President-elect Donald Trump's plans to boost infrastructure spending, investors remain bullish on gold. Analysts predict that prices will continue to rise, with some forecasting a price of $1,140 per ounce by the second quarter of next year.

The surge in gold prices has also been fueled by speculation, with many investors betting against the metal. However, physical demand has been picking up, cushioning the fall and providing support for prices.

As the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet later this month, markets are anticipating a decision on interest rates. A hike is expected, which could have negative implications for gold prices. Nevertheless, the metal remains a popular choice among investors seeking safe-haven assets.

In recent weeks, several high-profile elections have seen conservative candidates emerge victorious. In Arizona's 4th Congressional District, Republican Paul Gosar won the primary election, defeating attempts by the GOP establishment to discredit him.

Meanwhile, Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF) has announced its support for two U.S. Senate candidates who have won their primary elections: Mike Lee and Darryl Glenn. SCF is a national, grassroots organization that promotes conservative policies and helps elect conservative candidates.

In other news, a prominent Democrat, Lee Whitnum, has left the party after criticizing Governor Malloy and Congressman Murphy for pandering to ultra-conservative groups. Whitnum cited repeated bias by party chairwoman Nancy Dinardo as a contributing factor.

In Virginia, Democrats have made significant gains in recent elections, wiping out the Republican Party's presence in the state legislature. The polls showed that Republicans needed the outcome to be wrong, but ultimately lost.

Additionally, a new report has revealed that Democrats exploited the redistricting process in California to gain an advantage. The report highlights the ruthlessness of the Democratic Party and the incompetence of the Republican Party.

In other news, a recent poll shows that Beth Anne Rankin leads her nearest rival by 40% among Republican voters in Arkansas' 2nd Congressional District.

As the US politics landscape continues to shift, it's clear that conservative momentum is gaining ground. With organizations like SCF and candidates like Gosar and Rankin on the rise, it's likely that conservatives will continue to make gains in the coming years.","Midterm Elections: Democrats Face Uphill Battle

In the 2000 elections, Minnesota's Senate seat was a prime target for Democrats seeking to regain control of the majority. Mark Dayton, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson department store fortune, emerged victorious despite a contentious primary.

Meanwhile, in New York, Republicans were fighting hard to recapture a state senate seat in the ""Old Silk Stocking District."" The election pitted two candidates against each other, with one vowing to be an advocate for the city and the other insisting that her opponent's victory would only strengthen the conservative party.

Twenty-four years later, Joe Biden's words were being used by Democrats as a rallying cry. In 1992, Biden had urged an end to partisan differences over the court, but his remarks now seemed to undermine one of the best arguments for filling vacancies in an election year.

In the Senate, women were playing a crucial role in the elections. Joni Ernst's playbook was being studied by other female candidates, who were using her approach to win men's votes. However, not all women were successful - 13 out of 15 female senate candidates trailed badly or were in tight races.

In California, a budget deal had been reached after a record-long floor session. The agreement contained $14.8 billion in spending cuts and $12.5 billion in tax increases, and was seen as a template for other states to follow.

The Virginia governor's race was expected to be highly competitive, with polls showing a narrow advantage for one candidate over the other. Meanwhile, in Arizona, a special election had been held, with the Republican nominee emerging victorious.

In New York, Republicans were using negative ads to attack their opponents, including a prominent Democrat who was likened to a ""Nancy Pelosi"" figure. The ads were part of a larger effort by Republicans to win control of Congress.

In Arizona, a new governor had been elected, and the state's legislature was being reshaped. The outgoing speaker was leaving office due to term limits, and his successor was vowing to make changes to ensure lawmakers' safety.

Overall, the midterm elections were shaping up to be a closely contested and highly partisan affair, with Democrats facing an uphill battle to regain control of Congress.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(before it's news) the war between the west virginia secretary of state‘s office and the west virginia republican party continues on this week. the wvgop filed a law suit in kanawha county circuit court on friday with the first hearing scheduled for tomorrow. the law suit questions the legality of placing the u.s senate special election on the same ballot as the general election. janet “j.t.” thompson, an independent running in the 31st district house of delegates, also filed a similar suit last week. both plaintiffs are latching on to a vague part of h.b. 201, which says that “any special election, which is held under the provisions of this section and occurs concurrently with a general election, shall be a separate election from the general election.” h.b. 201 was passed during the july special session to change senate succession laws to allow for the special election. the language in h.b. 201 is vague. while it does consider the senate special election separate, it doesn’t necessarily mean both elections have to be on separate ballots. special elections appear on general election ballots all the time, as well as county and municipal races, which are separate from state and federal elections. both secretary of state natalie tennant and wvgop chairman mike stuart have recieved criticism over the

minnesota for senate democrats looking to regain the majority, the seat held by rod grams in this famously left-leaning state was ripe for the picking. mark dayton, an heir to the dayton-hudson department store fortune, beat mr. grams despite a nasty four-way primary that was the most expensive in state history (not least because two other candidates were also multimillionaires). democrats also picked up a house seat in the fourth district, where betty mccollum beat linda runbeck. this was a year in which, even here, in the land of hubert h. humphrey and walter f. mondale, democrats had to fight to win the presidency.

''there is no one who considers it his or her obligation to be the city's senator. but that is what my commitment would be.'' meanwhile, ms. krueger insists that the election of her republican opponent would only strengthen an already conservative republican party in albany. a vote for mr. eristoff, she insists, would only be a vote in support of less state aid for new york city's public schools and for weakening rent-regulation laws.

Article 4 - joni ernst’s playbook, for women to win men’s vote
of the 15 female senate candidates from the two major parties running this year, just two seem assured of victory: susan collins, the incumbent in maine , and representative shelley moore capito of west virginia , both of them republican. photo the other 13 are either trailing badly or, like ms. ernst, in tight races. among incumbents, kay hagan of north carolina , mary l. landrieu of louisiana and jeanne shaheen of new hampshire , all democrats, are fighting to hang on to their seats. two other bright democratic prospects — alison lundergan grimes in kentucky and michelle nunn in georgia — are in tough races in red states. ms. ernst, who beat four men in the primary, stands out as the lone republican woman in a cliffhanger campaign. if she beats her democratic opponent, representative bruce braley, in the race to succeed tom harkin , she will deprive democrats of a seat they have held for nearly 30 years — and perhaps help republicans take over the senate. “she’s a model for the republican success story,” said celinda lake, a democratic pollster. “they have run right-wing women before, but they haven’t had a right-wing woman before who was able to give so many gender-based cues while still maintaining their base.” analysts liken ms. ernst’s approach on gender to that of president

Article 5 - in budget deal, california shuts $41 billion gap
“california is an example of what you will see” across the country, said susan urahn, the managing director of the pew center on the states and a budget expert. the size of budget deficits in other states will lead to similarly hard-fought debates on how to close the gaps, ms. urahn said. what is more, california might have set the template as other states ponder how to apply the more fungible outlays of the federal stimulus money. “my guess is states will use what they can to reduce cuts to the bone in education and health care,” ms. urahn said. california’s budget agreement came after a record-long floor session of nearly 46 hours. democrats, who control both houses of the legislature, reluctantly agreed to a series of concessions to win the support of a single republican senator, whose vote was necessary to reach the two-thirds majority required under state law for budget bills. all 75 democrats in the legislature voted for the budget agreement, along with 6 of the 44 republicans in the two houses. gov. arnold schwarzenegger , a republican, said he would sign the agreement on friday. the pact contains $14.8 billion in spending cuts, including to public transit, health care, schools and the courts; $12.5 billion in tax increases; $5.4 billion in new borrowing; and the creation of a $1 billion reserve fund. photo personal income tax rates will rise by one

Article 6 - how the virginia governor’s race will be a test of trump’s impact
virginia is expected to be the more competitive of the two contests, as polls show mr. northam with only a narrow advantage, while mr. murphy, a former goldman sachs executive and ambassador, enjoys a sizable lead. there are also a host of local races, from mayoral contests to a special election in washington state to a health care referendum in maine, we will be keeping an eye on. here are some factors we will be paying attention to as voters go to the polls tuesday. virginia is becoming two states in one virginia’s politics are becoming sharply bifurcated by region in ways that reflect the country’s political trends. the so-called “urban crescent,” stretching from the washington suburbs down to greater richmond and east toward the chesapeake bay, is growing rapidly thanks to an influx of transplants who are transforming it into a democratic bulwark. the western half of the state, as well as the southern tier bordering north carolina, are seeing little population growth, and in some places even a decline, while becoming deeply republican. these trends are turning virginia from purple to blue, but it is an uneven progression for democrats because — as in much of the country — many of their core voters are less likely to vote in nonpresidential years. so while hillary clinton carried prince william county, a booming and ethnically diverse washington exurb, by 21 points last year, gov. terry

Article 7 - g.o.p. ads star democratic leader
“we don’t run denny hastert ads because he is speaker of the house and no one knows who he is,” said sarah feinberg, the spokeswoman. “people know who the president is, and that is why we have used him in more than 90 ads in 35 districts.” photo in a new york times/cbs news poll conducted last week, 55 percent of those polled said they had not heard enough about ms. pelosi to form an opinion about her, compared with 10 percent who viewed her favorably and 17 percent who viewed her unfavorably. other polls released in the last month have yielded similar results. still, many republicans are betting that the prospect of ms. pelosi replacing mr. hastert as speaker should the democrats take control of congress will scare undecided voters into voting republican. “nancy pelosi is like kryptonite in republican districts,” said ed patru, a spokesman for the republican national campaign committee, which is paying for some of the advertisements. “we’d be more than happy to fly nancy pelosi in to those districts.” here she is in one of the group’s advertisements against ms. bean: “melissa bean follows liberal nancy pelosi 83 percent of the time,” growls the announcer, over images of the golden gate bridge and some not-particularly-flattering snapshots of ms. pelosi, who represents san francisco. “melissa bean. just a nancy pel

Conservative Momentum Gains Ground in US Politics

In recent weeks, several high-profile elections have seen conservative candidates emerge victorious. In Arizona's 4th Congressional District, Republican Paul Gosar won the primary election, defeating attempts by the GOP establishment to discredit him.

Meanwhile, Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF) has announced its support for two U.S. Senate candidates who have won their primary elections: Mike Lee and Darryl Glenn. SCF is a national, grassroots organization that promotes conservative policies and helps elect conservative candidates.

In other news, a prominent Democrat, Lee Whitnum, has left the party after criticizing Governor Malloy and Congressman Murphy for pandering to ultra-conservative groups. Whitnum cited repeated bias by party chairwoman Nancy Dinardo as a contributing factor.

In Virginia, Democrats have made significant gains in recent elections, wiping out the Republican Party's presence in the state legislature. The polls showed that Republicans needed the outcome to be wrong, but ultimately lost.

Additionally, a new report has revealed that Democrats exploited the redistricting process in California to gain an advantage. The report highlights the ruthlessness of the Democratic Party and the incompetence of the Republican Party.

In other news, a recent poll shows that Beth Anne Rankin leads her nearest rival by 40% among Republican voters in Arkansas' 2nd Congressional District.

As the US politics landscape continues to shift, it's clear that conservative momentum is gaining ground. With organizations like SCF and candidates like Gosar and Rank

Midterm Elections: Democrats Face Uphill Battle

In the 2000 elections, Minnesota's Senate seat was a prime target for Democrats seeking to regain control of the majority. Mark Dayton, an heir to the Dayton-Hudson department store fortune, emerged victorious despite a contentious primary.

Meanwhile, in New York, Republicans were fighting hard to recapture a state senate seat in the ""Old Silk Stocking District."" The election pitted two candidates against each other, with one vowing to be an advocate for the city and the other insisting that her opponent's victory would only strengthen the conservative party.

Twenty-four years later, Joe Biden's words were being used by Democrats as a rallying cry. In 1992, Biden had urged an end to partisan differences over the court, but his remarks now seemed to undermine one of the best arguments for filling vacancies in an election year.

In the Senate, women were playing a crucial role in the elections. Joni Ernst's playbook was being studied by other female candidates, who were using her approach to win men's votes. However, not all women were successful - 13 out of 15 female senate candidates trailed badly or were in tight races.

In California, a budget deal had been reached after a record-long floor session. The agreement contained $14.8 billion in spending cuts and $12.5 billion in tax increases, and was seen as a template for other states to follow.

The Virginia governor's race was expected to be highly competitive, with

The Egyptian government has taken a hardline stance against the Muslim Brotherhood, labeling it a terrorist group and seizing the assets of over 500 Islamist leaders. The move has sparked concerns about the country's democratic transition and the potential for further repression.

The crackdown comes as Egypt prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi, who was a key figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. The government has also been accused of using violence against protesters, with reports of snipers targeting supporters of the ousted leader.

The situation is further complicated by the involvement of extremist groups, including Al-Qaeda-linked organizations. In January, Egypt blamed such a group for a bombing at a church in Alexandria that killed dozens of people.

The Muslim Brotherhood has denied any links to the attack and condemned the violence. However, the group's leadership has been targeted by the government, with many of its top officials facing arrest or exile.

The international community has expressed concern about Egypt's human rights record and the treatment of opposition groups. The US State Department has called for restraint and urged the Egyptian government to respect the rule of law.

As Egypt navigates this complex situation, it remains to be seen how the country will balance its desire for stability with its commitment to democratic principles.","Egypt's Turbulent Landscape

A powerful explosion rocked a police headquarters in Mansoura, killing at least 14 people and injuring nearly 100. The blast was believed to have been caused by a car bomb, but no group immediately claimed responsibility. The interim government accused the Muslim Brotherhood of orchestrating the attack.

The incident comes as Egypt's opposition gears up after a new constitution passed with 64% of voters approving it. However, the opposition vowed to carry the momentum from the fight against the charter into parliamentary elections. The National Salvation Front stated that they would confirm to the Islamists that deceiving in the name of religion is done once and for all.

The Muslim Brotherhood has been at the center of a regional feud with Gulf states, particularly Qatar, over its influence. Qatar's support for Islamist groups has led to tensions with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which consider the Brotherhood a threat to their stability.

Egyptian leaders have taken steps to crack down on the Brotherhood, freezing assets of 14 Islamist allies of ousted President Mohamed Morsi. The move is part of a broader effort to pressure Morsi's supporters to back down from their protests demanding his release and reinstatement.

The situation in Egypt has been marked by violence against Christians, with one man killed for selling alcohol in Alexandria. The government has called for unity against terrorism, but critics argue that dissenting voices are being silenced.

As the country navigates its complex landscape, it remains to be seen how the government will balance security concerns with the need for free expression and opposition.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! december 13, 2012 (stop imperialism) – the complexities of the arab spring and the struggle for political freedom throughout the arab world should not obscure what has now become an absolutely essential understanding for all anti-imperialists: the muslim brotherhood is one of the most powerful weapons of the western ruling class in the muslim world. while that may be a difficult pill for some to swallow for emotional or psychological reasons, one need look no further than the insidious role the organization is playing in syria and the abuses of power and human rights of the government of egypt. in the us-nato sponsored war against the assad government, the muslim brotherhood has emerged as the leading western-sanctioned force, the avant-garde of the imperialist assault. while, in egypt, president morsi and the brotherhood government seek to destroy what had been, little more than a year ago, the promise of the revolution. muslim brotherhood in syria this week’s establishment of the supreme military command, in charge of all military aid and coordination to the rebels, demonstrates unequivocally the leadership role of the muslim brotherhood in the drive for regime change in syria. as reuters reported , “the unified command includes many with ties to the muslim brotherhood and to salafists…it excludes the most senior officers who have defected from assad’s military.”[1] this command structure, formed at

Article 8 - egypt gives muslim brotherhood & demon spawn hamas, the big kiss-off!!
an egyptian court has banned all activities of hamas in egypt. it’s another sign that security forces plan to squeeze the palestinian group that runs the neighboring gaza strip. hamas is the spawn of egypt’s muslim brotherhood (mb), which egypt’s army-backed government has declared a terrorist group and has faced a security crackdown since the military ousted one of its leaders, mohamed morsi, from the presidency last summer. how dare the egyptian government put all those little jihadists…who worked so diligently in those arms-smuggling tunnels…out of work! and with so much unemployment…tsk, tsk, tsk… one of hamas’ illegal fund-raising activities was the gun smuggling tunnels….from which they gained tax revenue, as they simultaneously armed their jihadi cohorts in the sinai desert. according to reuters, in 2013-2014, egyptian military forces destroyed nearly all 1,200 tunnels which were used for smuggling weapons and other goods to gaza. that means the palestinian authority’s majority party, hamas, will struggle to pay thousands of civil servants. not because there isn’t enough monetary assistance coming into the pa from the west…since hundreds of millions regularly pour into their coffers…but because most of that just happens to end up in the weapons depot, which is better known as the gaza strip. egyptian authorities see hamas as a security threat to the country.

the muslim brotherhood’s useful idiots (before it's news) the muslim brotherhood’s useful idiots by caroline glick you have to hand it to the leaders of the muslim brotherhood. they know how to play power politics. they know how to acquire power. and they know how to use power. last friday, the day before voters by most accounts elected the brotherhood’s candidate mohamed morsy to serve as egypt’s next president, the wall street journal published a riveting account by charles levinson and matt bradley of how the brotherhood outmaneuvered the secular revolutionaries to take control of the country’s political space. the brotherhood kept a very low profile in the mass demonstrations in tahrir square in january and february 2011 that led to the overthrow of then-president hosni mubarak. the brotherhood’s absence from tahrir square at that time is what enabled westerners to fall in love with the egyptian revolution. those demonstrations led to the impression, widespread in the us, that mubarak’s successors would be secular facebook democrats. the role that google’s young egyptian executive wael gonim played in organizing the demonstrations was reported expansively. his participation in the anti-regime protests – as well as his brief incarceration – was seen as proof that the next egyptian regime would be indistinguishable from generation x and y americans and europeans. in their

(wnv/ahmed salah) it took the crash of an egyptian airplane for the world to notice that egyptians are defying the military tyrant who rules our country. the airline, of course, is egyptair flight 804, which crashed into the mediterranean sea on may 19. while the press speculated about the cause of the crash, they reported that an eerily prescient graffiti message had appeared on the belly of the plane two years earlier: “we will bring this plane down.” the military tyrant is abdel fattah el-sisi, the egyptian president and former general who was “elected” by 96 percent of voters after ordering the massacre of 1,150 men, women and children who died protesting peacefully. sisi was the reason for the eerie message. the graffiti was not a threat of terrorism. rather it was a response to the plane’s technical name: su-gcc. since the last two letters (‘cc’) sound like the president’s name (sisi), workers who wrote the message intended to make a political statement about removing sisi from power. it’s unfortunate that this is what it took to get egyptians’ resistance to

Article 1 - egypt car bombing targets police
cairo — a powerful explosion believed to have been caused by a car bomb rocked a police headquarters in a nile delta city north of cairo early tuesday, killing at least 14 people and injuring nearly 100, according to the state news agency and a security official. the explosion took place in mansoura, about 75 miles north of cairo, and it caused parts of the five-floor building to collapse, according to the middle east news agency. no group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but the interim government accused the muslim brotherhood of orchestrating the attack. the news agency quoted a cabinet spokesman, sherif shawki, as saying that the brotherhood showed its “ugly face as a terrorist organization shedding blood and messing with egypt’s security.” the attack came a day after an islamic militant group, ansar beit al-maqdis, called on police officers and soldiers to desert or face death at the hands of its fighters. most of those killed tuesday were police officers. the group and others have claimed responsibility for several attacks on security forces since the ouster of president mohamed morsi in july.

Article 2 - all of islam isn’t the enemy
is president trump trying to make enemies of the entire muslim world? that could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven muslim nations with an order designating the muslim brotherhood — perhaps the most influential islamist group in the middle east — as a terrorist organization. such an order, now under consideration, would be seen by many muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of islam. it appears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an america under siege by what they call radical islam. photo the struggle against extremism is complex, and solutions must be tailored both to the facts and to an understanding of the likely consequences. since 1997, the secretary of state has had the power to designate groups as foreign terrorist organizations, thus subjecting them, as well as people and businesses who deal with them, to sanctions, like freezing their assets. president barack obama resisted adding the brotherhood to that list. there are good reasons that the brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn’t merit the terrorist designation. rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. while the brotherhood calls for a society governed by islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded

Article 3 - egypt opposition gears up after constitution passes
mr. sabahi and other political leaders accused the islamists of manipulating religious faith to rally support for the constitution in an effort to increase their own power and to “support capitalist interests.” the opposition also vowed to carry the momentum from the fight against the charter into the parliamentary elections. photo “we will confirm to them that deceiving in the name of religion is done once and for all,” the main opposition coalition, the national salvation front, said in a statement. amr hamzawy, a political scientist and liberal political leader, said the size of the vote against the constitution was a measure of the opposition’s growing clout. “we have a majority that isn’t big, and a minority that isn’t small. this means there is an evident division in society,” he said, adding, “we feel we’ve made a major achievement.” about 64 percent of voters in the two-part referendum approved the new charter, egyptian state media reported sunday, citing preliminary results. about 57 percent voted yes in last weekend’s first phase, which included cairo, where a sizable majority voted no. in the more rural precincts that voted on saturday, more than 70 percent voted yes, outlining egypt’s cultural divide. photo the turnout in both rounds remained low, at just over 30 percent of eligible voters, according to the preliminary figures. a referendum on a plan for the transition after the ouster of president hosni mubarak drew about 41 percent of

Article 4 - gulf states and qatar gloss over differences, but split still hampers them
at the heart of the feud is a dispute over political islam pitting qatar against its neighbors, principally saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. having struck an alliance with the muslim brotherhood in a play for regional influence, qatar financially supported the group’s former government in egypt, opposed the military takeover as an illegal “coup” and provided a haven to islamists in exile after the subsequent crackdown. qatar’s al jazeera network has repeatedly excoriated the new government of president abdel fattah el-sisi. saudi arabia and the u.a.e., which consider the brotherhood a threat to their own stability, both backed the egyptian military takeover. and both have pressed qatar to expel the exiled islamists and curb al jazeera. in the weeks leading up to this month’s regional summit, several gulf news outlets had reported that qatar had effectively buckled, agreeing to both demands. a final communiqué from the meeting expressed “full support for egypt” and mr. sisi’s “road map” for a political transition. but government officials on both sides of the gulf split now acknowledge privately that qatar scarcely budged. instead, saudi arabia and the emirates suspended their anti-brotherhood campaign against qatar because of the more urgent threats they saw gathering around them. a senior qatari official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the joint commun

expand | collapse (photo: reuters/mohamed abd el ghany) a poster of deposed president mohamed mursi which reads, ""no to the coup"", is near debris of a protest camp outside the burnt rabaa adawiya mosque, in cairo, august 15, 2013. egypt's muslim brotherhood called on followers to march in protest in cairo on thursday, after at least 525 people were killed in a security crackdown on the islamist movement that has left the most populous arab nation polarized and in turmoil. every democracy must defend itself against those who exploit its liberties to destroy it from within. the west must realize that naïvely open societies are the meals of plotting wolves, and totalitarian ideologies will exploit every freedom and benefit of the doubt that they are given. the documentary film ""the grand deception,"" by terrorism expert steven emerson, demonstrates in frightening detail just how much the muslim brotherhood has infiltrated u.s. society – from the media, to university campuses, to local and federal government. apologists for islamists will reflexively label the expose as ""islamophobic"" but the film is based on well-documented cases pursued by the department of justice. unfortunately, one of the dangers underscored in the film has already materialized: islamists and their sympathizers increasingly dominate college campuses, and the trend threatens those who want to remain free of sharia law, those who openly support israel

Article 6 - egyptian leaders freeze assets of morsi backers
cairo — egypt’s new military-led government said sunday that it was freezing the assets of 14 islamist allies of the ousted president, mohamed morsi, stepping up its pressure on his supporters to back down from their continuing public protests demanding his release and reinstatement. officials associated with the military takeover say they want all factions, including the islamists, to participate in forming a government and competing for a new parliament. but the islamists object to the military overthrow of an elected government and a newly ratified constitution. and they note that the generals are proceeding with the extralegal detention of the president, as well as with the arrests of scores of top islamists leaders. among others, the asset freeze hit khairat el-shater, a millionaire businessman who is both the chief financier and the chief strategist of the muslim brotherhood, the main islamist group backing mr. morsi. because of mr. shater’s importance to the group, he was subjected to long years in prison and asset seizures under president hosni mubarak, and he sometimes handled the group’s negotiations with mr. mubarak’s government from inside his jail cell. the freeze also included the brotherhood’s spiritual leader, mohamed badie, and the leader of its political arm, saad el-katatni, the former speaker of parliament. mr. morsi is being detained without any legal warrant, but the new government has charged the other islamist

print by ahmed aboulenein cairo (reuters) - egypt said on thursday police had uncovered a stash of weapons that supporters of the outlawed muslim brotherhood were plotting to use ahead of planned protests against deteriorating economic conditions. a little-known group calling itself movement of the poor called in recent months for egyptians to protest on nov. 11 against rising prices and deepening austerity. the call gained traction on social media after egypt floated its pound and raised fuel prices last week, a move hailed by bankers but bemoaned by ordinary people as the latest blow to their dwindling spending power. but the movement of the poor said on its facebook page on wednesday it canceled the protests due to a police crackdown. having won little support from activist groups, it was unclear if protests would go ahead on friday. but in a country where street politics helped unseat two presidents within two years, authorities are taking no chances. dozens of people were detained in recent weeks for allegedly inciting unrest. the interior ministry said on thursday it confiscated a cache of arms and ammunition hidden in a graveyard and house in fayoum province, southwest of cairo. it also said it raided five bomb factories around the country on wednesday, accusing a militant group of coordinating with the brotherhood to attack police checkpoints on the eve of the protests.

Egypt's Crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood Raises Concerns

The Egyptian government has taken a hardline stance against the Muslim Brotherhood, labeling it a terrorist group and seizing the assets of over 500 Islamist leaders. The move has sparked concerns about the country's democratic transition and the potential for further repression.

The crackdown comes as Egypt prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of the ousting of President Mohamed Morsi, who was a key figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. The government has also been accused of using violence against protesters, with reports of snipers targeting supporters of the ousted leader.

The situation is further complicated by the involvement of extremist groups, including Al-Qaeda-linked organizations. In January, Egypt blamed such a group for a bombing at a church in Alexandria that killed dozens of people.

The Muslim Brotherhood has denied any links to the attack and condemned the violence. However, the group's leadership has been targeted by the government, with many of its top officials facing arrest or exile.

The international community has expressed concern about Egypt's human rights record and the treatment of opposition groups. The US State Department has called for restraint and urged the Egyptian government to respect the rule of law.

As Egypt navigates this complex situation, it remains to be seen how the country will balance its desire for stability with its commitment to democratic principles.

Egypt's Turbulent Landscape

A powerful explosion rocked a police headquarters in Mansoura, killing at least 14 people and injuring nearly 100. The blast was believed to have been caused by a car bomb, but no group immediately claimed responsibility. The interim government accused the Muslim Brotherhood of orchestrating the attack.

The incident comes as Egypt's opposition gears up after a new constitution passed with 64% of voters approving it. However, the opposition vowed to carry the momentum from the fight against the charter into parliamentary elections. The National Salvation Front stated that they would confirm to the Islamists that deceiving in the name of religion is done once and for all.

The Muslim Brotherhood has been at the center of a regional feud with Gulf states, particularly Qatar, over its influence. Qatar's support for Islamist groups has led to tensions with Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which consider the Brotherhood a threat to their stability.

Egyptian leaders have taken steps to crack down on the Brotherhood, freezing assets of 14 Islamist allies of ousted President Mohamed Morsi. The move is part of a broader effort to pressure Morsi's supporters to back down from their protests demanding his release and reinstatement.

The situation in Egypt has been marked by violence against Christians, with one man killed for selling alcohol in Alexandria. The government has called for unity against terrorism, but critics argue that dissenting voices are being silenced.

As the country navigates its complex landscape, it remains to be seen how the government will balance security

9107511.0,reliable,fake,0.8,145.09617376327515,False,"The article ""Domain Sales Soar to $1.8 Million in 2012"" appears to be a fabricated news piece, as it lacks specific details and facts that would make it plausible. In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides concrete information about online media entrepreneurs, incubators, and established companies like Dow Jones and Google. The article's focus on domain sales is also not supported by any credible sources or data. Furthermore, the tone and style of the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE are more sensationalized and lacking in depth compared to the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE.","Domain Sales Soar to $1.8 Million in 2012

The domain sales market experienced a significant surge in 2012, with top sellers reaching as high as $81,250 for the domain treadmill.com. According to recent reports, the total sales figure for the year was a staggering $1.8 million.

Among the notable sales were several .com domains, including wewatch.com and southeastbank.com, which fetched prices of $65,000 and $25,000 respectively. Other top sellers included draincleaning.com at $18,000 and countryrock.com at $16,000.

Meanwhile, in the world of renewable energy, FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL) saw a significant increase in its stock price, rising by 12.27% to $1.3585 per share. This was attributed to growing demand for stationary fuel cell power plants in Asia.

In other news, Tango.me, a messaging app with over 200 million registered users, raised $280 million in funding from Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce giant. The company's growth has been phenomenal, with active monthly users doubling in just one year.

In the biotech sector, Genspera Inc. (GNSZ) announced the issuance of a US patent for methods and compositions for detecting, imaging, and treating cancer. The patent was issued on July 8, 2014, and is expected to play a significant role in the company's future growth.

As the domain industry continues to evolve, it's clear that new extensions like .ws are gaining traction. While some investors view these extensions as high-risk investments, others see them as opportunities for growth. With the rise of online advertising expected to reach $400 billion by 2023, it's likely that domain sales will continue to soar in the coming years.","In the rapidly evolving landscape of online media, a new breed of entrepreneurs is emerging. These individuals are not bound by traditional notions of success or conventional business models. Instead, they are driven by a passion for creating content that resonates with their audience.

One such entrepreneur, who prefers to remain anonymous, has built a successful website from scratch. With no prior experience in the industry, he and his partner took a risk on each other, pouring their savings into the venture. Despite initial doubts, their site gained traction, attracting a loyal following of media insiders and hip twentysomethens.

This success story is not unique. Across the country, incubators are sprouting up, providing financial, strategic, and technical support to entrepreneurs in exchange for a percentage of stock. These incubators have become essential tools for start-ups, helping them navigate the complex process of turning a business plan into a fully formed company.

Meanwhile, established companies are also taking notice of the online landscape. Dow Jones is reportedly on the verge of acquiring MarketWatch, a popular financial news site. This deal would mark a significant shift in the media industry, as it would give Dow Jones access to MarketWatch's vast network of users and revenue streams.

In other parts of the world, Google is struggling to find its footing. Despite being the leading search engine globally, the company lags behind local competitors in Russia, where Yandex dominates the market. This has led to a re-evaluation of Google's strategy in Russia, with the company revamping its site to better compete.

As the online landscape continues to evolve, new opportunities are emerging. Start-ups like Facebook and SpeakOut.com are capitalizing on the growing demand for online political information. These companies are offering users a platform to engage with politicians and access data about their views.

However, not all start-ups are experiencing success. The crowdfunding industry is facing challenges, with some sites being shut down due to non-compliance with regulations. Despite these setbacks, investors remain optimistic about the potential of crowdfunding, with some firms predicting significant growth in the coming years.

Overall, the online media landscape is characterized by innovation, risk-taking, and adaptability. As entrepreneurs continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it will be interesting to see how established companies respond and whether new players can disrupt the status quo.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

leading the pack was yandex, a privately held russian search engine that was visited by 64 percent of internet users; mail.ru, an e-mail service, came in second at 56 percent, and rambler was third at 53 percent. but even in its share of revenue from ads linked to searches, the lucrative internet business model pioneered by google, the company lags. yandex controls 50 percent of the russian market for such ads, according to analysts at ing, a dutch bank. rambler is second with 41 percent and all other companies, including google, fight over the remaining 9 percent. russia is not the only country in which google has faced difficulties. in china, google was allowed in only after agreeing to self-censor its search results. russia, in contrast, allows google and local search companies to operate without political interference; for instance, a search on www.google.ru for polonium — the radioactive substance used to kill the former russian spy alexander v. litvinenko in britain last month — returned 11.1 million results. the company’s difficulties in russia probably have more to do with the complexities of the language than with politics. photo “our understanding of russian was not as good as we wanted it to be,” said kannan pashupathy, head of international engineering at google. google revamped its russian site last week, mr. pashupathy said, improving its ability to deal with russian,

Article 5 - measuring a giant's stature: investors get the chance to assess facebook's potential
with a huge initial public offering on the runway, facebook has shown that it pays to have friends. new investors will now have to decide what they are willing to pay to be friends. the giant social network said in a filing on wednesday that it was seeking to raise up to $5 billion through its i.p.o. many close to the company say that facebook is aiming for a debut that would value it between $75 billion and $100 billion. at the top end of the range, facebook would be far bigger than many established american companies, including amazon, caterpillar, kraft foods, goldman sachs and ford motor. only 26 companies in the standard & poor's index of 500 stocks have a market value north of $100 billion. already, facebook is a formidable moneymaker. the company, which mainly sells advertising and virtual goods, recorded revenue of $3.71 billion in 2011, an 88 percent increase from the previous year. according to its filing, facebook posted a profit of $1 billion last year. ''facebook will have more traffic than anyone else, and they'll have more data than anyone else,'' said kevin landis, the portfolio manager of firsthand technology value fund, which owns shares in the privately held company. ''so, unless they are impervious to learning how to monetize that data, they should be the most valuable property on the internet, eventually.'' a lofty valuation for facebook would evoke the grandiose

Article 6 - for-profit web sites give new meaning to campaign financing
''it's a great time to get involved with the process,'' said joshua king, spokesman for a new company, speakout.com. the company's business strategy is to offer users a conduit to write to their elected representatives, then sell the data about the users' political views in aggregate form to campaigns and corporations. a recent survey of likely voters who use the internet showed that about a quarter of respondents had searched for information about political candidates. the research, a random telephone survey of 1,200 adults, was conducted by george washington university in october. the findings also showed, however, that the respondents were highly selective about which sources of online political information they trusted, placing the most trust in church groups and state election boards, and the least trust in online service providers, political parties and campaigns. as new players compete for this group's attention, voter.com plans to spend $70 million advertising its site this year. mr. dangel said the company had already raised part of that amount. another start-up, govote.com, was established to be ''the leading destination for politics on the web,'' said paul hrabal, the company's president, a 33-year-old former executive at dell computer. backers of these sites say the public needs a politics portal that will provide voters with information about all candidates in one visit. that feature -- along with the ability to sell sharply aimed advertising to candidates and lobbying groups -- could make the business model work, these investors say.

Article 7 - a web retailer buys the perfect domain name. then comes a letdown.
the options mr. braverman had long coveted the clarity of the nuts domain name. but its owner was hidden behind a hosting business and therefore almost impossible to find. for years, it did not matter because the newark nut company was too small to afford the price that such an unmistakable address would demand, probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. as the company grew, the price began to seem more reasonable. in 2009, mr. braverman contemplated hiring a private detective to find the site owner, but he managed to track the man down himself. they talked, and the owner of nuts forwarded a day’s worth of the site’s traffic to a server mr. braverman had set up for analysis. the traffic was moderate and much of it came from britain, something mr. braverman attributed to web users searching for a british men’s magazine called nuts. as he saw it, mr. braverman could continue to build his brand with the original name, which was not going badly, or he could buy nuts, which raised concerns about the price — he suspected that the owner wanted $1 million — and about the logistics of the change. he found few resources to consult and little history of brands changing their names online. trying to place a value on a domain name seemed murky at best. “we did a lot of analysis on our own,” mr. braverman said. “at the end of the day, it became a gut thing.” the more he thought about

Article 10 - a kink in venture capital’s gold chain
but excess of capital is only part of the problem, the firm said. in its letter, it bemoaned what it described as “a terribly weak exit environment,” a reference to the dearth of initial public offerings and to a market for acquisitions at valuations that it considers too low to deliver the kind of returns that venture investors expect. at a time when young companies like youtube and facebook are said to be entertaining acquisition offers in the $1 billion neighborhood, that pronouncement may seem surprising. but mr. dow said those “megadeals” were rare and were not enough to sustain an entire industry. “while good returns from any given firm’s portfolio is certainly a possibility, the statistics have clearly shifted in an unfavorable direction,” the firm wrote. “the venture environment has changed so that overall returns for the entire industry are way too low and even the upper-quartile returns have dropped to insufficient levels.” sevin rosen’s credibility is bolstered by the roster of companies it has helped lead to public offerings in the past, including compaq, lotus and cypress semiconductor. it has been describing adverse market conditions, to its investors and to the news media, for at least two years. but it finally decided that it could not be telling investors of a poor market for venture investing while continuing to take their money. “if we really believe that there are fundamental structural problems in the venture industry, should we raise our fund and just hope that the problems will get better?” the

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE
---------------------
In the rapidly evolving landscape of online media, a new breed of entrepreneurs is emerging. These individuals are not bound by traditional notions of success or conventional business models. Instead, they are driven by a passion for creating content that resonates with their audience.

One such entrepreneur, who prefers to remain anonymous, has built a successful website from scratch. With no prior experience in the industry, he and his partner took a risk on each other, pouring their savings into the venture. Despite initial doubts, their site gained traction, attracting a loyal following of media insiders and hip twentysomethens.

This success story is not unique. Across the country, incubators are sprouting up, providing financial, strategic, and technical support to entrepreneurs in exchange for a percentage of stock. These incubators have become essential tools for start-ups, helping them navigate the complex process of turning a business plan into a fully formed company.

Meanwhile, established companies are also taking notice of the online landscape. Dow Jones is reportedly on the verge of acquiring MarketWatch, a popular financial news site. This deal would mark a significant shift in the media industry, as it would give Dow Jones access to MarketWatch's vast network of users and revenue streams.

In other parts of the world, Google is struggling to find its footing. Despite being the leading search engine globally, the company lags behind local competitors in Russia, where Yandex dominates the market. This has led to a re-evaluation of Google's strategy in Russia,

It uses sensational language, draws parallels between past events and modern-day issues without providing concrete evidence, and includes unsubstantiated claims such as Hitler's Christmas party featuring a swastika on top of the tree. The article also lacks credible sources and appears to be an attempt to create controversy where none exists. In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides factual information about Berlin's architectural landscape and historical context without resorting to sensationalism or unsubstantiated claims.","Historical Figures and Events Continue to Haunt Modern Times

A recent surge in searches for Bitcoin and Blockchain has led some to draw parallels with the past, particularly when it comes to authoritarian regimes. The name of Adolf Hitler, once a symbol of fear and oppression, is being invoked by some as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power.

In 1943, Colonel Freiherr von Gersdorff attempted to assassinate Hitler at the Zeughaus Museum in Berlin, but his plan was foiled when Hitler left early. The would-be assassin had placed bombs in his pockets and intended to detonate them when they were close to Hitler.

Fast forward to today, where some are drawing comparisons between the Nazi regime's treatment of its citizens and modern-day policies on immigration. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced criticism for her handling of migrant policy, with some accusing her of prioritizing the interests of migrants over those of her own people.

In a bizarre twist, it has been revealed that Hitler's Christmas party in 1941 featured a swastika instead of an angel on top of the tree. The Nazi leader had replaced traditional Christmas celebrations with a holiday of the ""winter solstice,"" reflecting his disdain for Christianity.

Meanwhile, researchers have discovered a secret Nazi hideout in the Argentine jungle, which was allegedly used as a last resort in case of defeat during World War II.

As we navigate these complex issues, it's essential to remember that history is not always linear. The past can be both instructive and unsettling, serving as a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of protecting human rights.","Berlin's Architectural Landscape Under Scrutiny

As Germany continues to grapple with its complex past, the city's architectural landscape is facing renewed scrutiny. A recent design for a new Beijing axis has sparked debate about the influence of the country's tumultuous history on contemporary architecture.

Meanwhile, in Berlin, a prominent minister has been making headlines with his outspoken views on politics and society. The pastor, who was born into a family with a complicated past, has been credited with helping to shape Germany's post-war identity.

In another part of the city, a Jewish company is being recognized for its contributions to Berlin's cultural heritage. The foundry, which dates back to the 19th century, has produced iconic landmarks such as the Reichstag building.

However, not all of Berlin's architectural treasures are without controversy. A former government bunker, built in the 1970s, was recently abandoned due to high maintenance costs and concerns about its secrecy.

A new exhibit at the German Historical Museum is also sparking debate about Germany's role in World War II. The show focuses on the everyday ways that ordinary Germans accepted and celebrated the Nazi regime, rather than glorifying Hitler himself.

As Berlin continues to navigate its complex past, the city's architecture remains a source of fascination and controversy. With new developments and exhibits emerging regularly, it is clear that Germany's architectural landscape will remain a topic of interest for years to come.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - the house of speer: still rising on the skyline
not surprisingly, the question has been raised in germany -- though apparently not in china -- whether something ghoulish from the past was being resurrected in the younger mr. speer's beijing design. was the son, consciously or not, trying to resurrect the spirit of his father, to build in beijing what his father had been prevented by germany's defeat in the war from building in berlin? ''his beijing axis is re-awakening old memories,'' read a recent article a week ago by sophie mühlmann in the german newspaper die welt. ''wasn't there a legendary north-south axis planned by the elder speer for hitler's new berlin, which was to be called 'world capital germania?' is his son trying to copy him, or rather outdo him?'' mr. speer's short answer to that question is: no, he was not copying or outdoing or even thinking much about his father as he conceived his design for the beijing of the future. but germany is a country where questions about the past are always being raised. berlin's recent re-emergence as the capital of a united germany has been the occasion for repeated, often heated, debate about architecture, marked by concern that nothing be built to suggest the monumentalism of the nazi era. for mr. speer, who, despite his name has made a highly successful career elsewhere in germany and around the world, questions about his axis and that other axis are

Article 2 - a clergyman of the streets leaves his historic pulpit
outspoken and energetic, the minister seems far younger in person. he has arresting blue eyes and a commanding yet calming presence. with his signature denim vest and his spiky white hair, he looks more like a taxi driver than a man of god, but that fits perfectly with his philosophy of active engagement. “i always wanted also to move in the earthly realm,” pastor führer said. “it is not the throne and the altar but the street and the altar that belong together.” christian führer was born in leipzig in 1943, during world war ii. aside from how fitting his given name, christian, is for a minister, his last name, führer, simply means leader. yet, for many — especially non-german speakers — the word is all but inseparable from hitler. in addition to meaning leader, however, it also means guide, appropriate for a spiritual counselor. a sickly child, he was fascinated by the way jesus cared for the abject and the outsiders, and from a young age he knew he wanted to follow his father into the ministry. it was not a monastic life, however, but one of involvement that he sought. pastor führer cited dietrich bonhoeffer, the prominent german protestant theologian who was part of a plot to overthrow hitler, and was eventually executed in a concentration camp, as among his greatest influences. “the church must always be political,” he said, “

added mrs. soybel, ''we had a very traditional berlin childhood and were protected from family business matters.'' the loevy family had a typical success story of late 19th- and early 20th-century berlin. they came to berlin from east prussia and established the foundry in 1855. within two generations the foundry had become one of the top names in the business and was receiving commissions from leading architects like peter behrens, walter gropius and bruno paul. s. a. loevy took on the reichstag commission in 1916 after kaiser wilhelm ii gave his belated approval to dedicating the 22-year-old parliament to the citizens of germany. the concept had been proposed in the early 1890's by paul wallot, the building's architect, but no agreement was reached on the wording. nothing progressed until 1915, when a newspaper article argued that the dedication would reconcile the kaiser with an increasingly disgruntled populace. the inscription (behrens designed its gothic script) was bolted to the frieze above the portico entrance to show the democratic dimension of the german reich. produced from two bronze cannons captured in battle and melted, the dedication was also conceived as a rallying point for the nation in the throes of world war i, in which loevy family members served for germany and one, peter loevy, died. ''the great irony is that the lo

Article 4 - last call for an elegant rail station
bonatz’s most celebrated works, like a system of streamlined locks and bridges built along the rhine in the late 1920s, have a spare elegance reminiscent of the best examples of w.p.a. architecture in america. and even some of his nazi-era work, like the 1936 basel art museum, has an undeniably human dimension. its stone facade, with its low classical arches, remains one of the city’s beloved landmarks. but bonatz is not an easy architect to love. the struggle to keep his practice afloat at the height of the nazi era led him into endless compromises — aesthetic and moral. his studies for a gargantuan round stadium and a munich train station — mercifully never built — represented the kind of grotesquely overblown classicism that hitler adored. at the same time, his criticism of the work of paul troost, one of hitler’s favorite architects, irritated the gestapo. he eventually fled to turkey. bonatz, in other words, was the kind of morally ambiguous opportunist found throughout architectural history, someone who may have ignored uncomfortable political realities when it served his interests and who fine-tuned his aesthetic to suit the values of his clients. yet he also produced works of undeniable beauty. completed several years before hitler took power, the stuttgart terminal may be bonatz’s most masterly architectural balancing act. its imposing front facade, marked by a shallow arcade and towering stone

Article 5 - germany, again, calls on u.s. to answer spying accusations
beginning last year, the government had strengthened counterintelligence measures, the statement said. the latest reports only confirm that the government was fully justified in doing so, mr. seibert added. revelations by the antisecrecy group wikileaks in 2010, and especially by edward j. snowden in 2013, suggesting that the united states spied extensively on its european allies have reverberated in berlin more than in other capitals. in part, that is because the germans well remember how nazi and communist former regimes spied on their citizens. but it is also because germany’s intelligence agencies are subject to parliamentary scrutiny that often results in information leaking to the news media. intelligence officials complain that this hampers them, while other germans argue for even more openness about what germany and its allies are up to. the latest round erupted this week when german and french news outlets published documents made public by wikileaks. the documents included what was said to be a summary of conversation ms. merkel had in october 2011 with an unidentified personal adviser about the debt crisis in greece; a document from the chancellor’s senior adviser on european affairs; and a list of 69 telephone numbers that were said to belong to members of the german government or their aides. if the documents are genuine, they would seem to indicate that american spying on german officials had gone on for decades; some of the phone numbers appeared to date to the days before reunification when the

Article 6 - separate journeys for holocaust survivors
as they make their way from prague through the former yugoslavia to italy, visiting the places mr. wiener hid out from the nazis, he tells a true story of escape that is as gripping as any hollywood action movie. mr. wiener eventually landed in england, where he joined the royal air force as a fighter pilot. the movie opens with a scene of mr. wiener, still imperiously handsome in his late 70's with a nearly full head of white hair and a ted turner mustache, methodically hammering a punching bag at his home in lenox, mass. the two friends meet in washington for an initial planning session. from there the film follows them to prague, where mr. wiener visits the former office of the nazi collaborator who gave him an exit visa but contemptuously predicted he wouldn't live long enough to wear out one pair of shoes. mr. wiener credits his determination to prove that official wrong and return one day to kill him as being a key to his survival. six years later, he recalls, he returned triumphantly to confront the same man. hate had kept him alive. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing

Article 7 - in vineyards, a german ‘dr. strangelove’ secret
started in 1960, a year before the wall went up, the bunker cost $2.5 billion to construct. by the time it was completed in 1972, there were nearly 12 miles of tunnels, 936 bedrooms, 897 offices, and five small hospitals. it had five sections, each with its own electricity and water supply. it was designed to enable 3,000 people to survive for 30 days after an attack. among those, presumably, would be the chancellor, who could get here quickly from bonn, the former west german capital, 18 miles away. ringed with barbed-wire fences and hidden among the leafy vines, it was — with apologies to the shadowy outposts lurking in the countryside around washington, d.c. — the ultimate “undisclosed location.” except that with the end of the cold war, the secrets of this government bunker began leaking out. in the mid-1990s, the chancellor, helmut kohl, came under fire after his ministers requested more than $100 million to upgrade the complex with new furniture, fire-protection equipment and communications technology. the government had already decided to move the capital to berlin from bonn, and opposition leaders in parliament cried foul. just maintaining the bunker cost $14 million a year and required the work of 180 employees. unable to defend its expensive dinosaur, the government decided in 1997 to abandon the complex. photo its first move was to solicit proposals

Article 8 - hitler exhibit explores a wider circle of guilt
correction appended berlin -- as artifacts go, they are mere trinkets -- an old purse, playing cards, a lantern. even the display that caused the crowds to stop and stare is a simple embroidered tapestry, stitched by village women. but the exhibits that opened friday at the german historical museum are intentionally prosaic: they emphasize the everyday way that ordinary germans once accepted, and often celebrated, hitler. the household items had nazi logos and colors. the tapestry, a tribute to the union of church, state and party, was woven by a church congregation at the behest of their priest. ''this is what we call self-mobilization of society,'' said hans-ulrich thamer, one of three curators to assemble the exhibit at the german historical museum. ''as a person, hitler was a very ordinary man. he was nothing without the people.'' this show, ''hitler and the germans: nation and crime,'' opened friday. it was billed as the first in germany since the end of world war ii to focus exclusively on adolf hitler. germany outlaws public displays of some nazi symbols, and the curators took care to avoid showing items that appeared to glorify hitler. his uniforms, for example, remained in storage. instead, the show focuses on the society that nurtured and empowered him. it is not the first time historians have argued that hitler did not corral the germans as much as the germans

Article 9 - berlin mayor to shun holocaust memorial event
mr. diepgen has argued that the memorial is too big and impossible to protect. officials close to him have suggested that it may be unnecessary in a city that already has several smaller monuments commemorating the holocaust. by its position and size, the memorial, by the new york architect peter eisenman, will be a dominant feature of the city. it is to be built at a time when many germans feel that the country has done enough to commemorate, confront and pay compensation for the holocaust. michael-andreas butz, the spokesman for the mayor, who is a christian democrat, did not return several telephone calls seeking comment. in statements to the german press, he has said the mayor is far too busy, may not have been invited, and will in any event be represented by another senior christian democratic politician. mr. naumann said he was sure that the mayor had been invited and that his absence from the ceremony would be unfortunate. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. american officials, already in a conflict with mr. diepgen over security for a new american embassy in berlin, expressed irritation at the mayor

Article 10 - refuse heap is archive for night of hatred
finding it turned out to be as simple as asking one of klandorf’s 180 residents for the whereabouts of the local trash dump. the day after kristallnacht, trains loaded with personal and religious items arrived in the woods outside klandorf. political prisoners from a nearby camp unloaded the material and threw it all in a dump here. “it is no secret in our town that things stolen during kristallnacht are there,” said arno gielsdorf, 49. his family owns a section of the klandorf refuse heap, which is roughly the size of four soccer fields. he said his father told him that the dump was extraordinarily busy right after kristallnacht. the story might have remained a bit of local lore but for a chance encounter last december. werner russ, a retired forester, was gathering mushrooms when he ran into yaron svoray, an israeli writer and former detective who was researching stolen artifacts once stashed in a nearby hunting lodge that belonged to hermann göring, the luftwaffe commander. mr. russ, 73, confirmed to mr. svoray what people of klandorf had always known about the local dump. “we’re away from everything here,” he said. “i thought surely it would not interest anyone.” photo mr. svoray, though, was decidedly interested. he returned in spring, bringing along three friends with shovels and picks. they dug up a green

Content: google maps renames german square after adolf hitler % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) kurt nimmo infowars.com january 10, 2014 oops. google‘s bad. it made the unpardonable mistake of allowing theodor-heuss-platz in berlin to be called by its politically incorrect former name – adolf-hitler-platz. the name appeared ever so briefly on google maps. “we were made aware of a false and inappropriate street name on google maps and corrected it immediately,” lena wagner, a spokeswoman for google‘s german unit, told the afp. “we apologize for this mistake.” afp hinted the mistake may have been the work of hackers. pranksters once made cologne’s famous cathedral disappear from the popular online map website. the berlin city square is presently named after the first federal president of germany, theodor heuss. in 1933, the name was changed from its original name of reichskanzlerplatz to adolf-hitler-platz as dictated by plans for the welthauptstadt germania (or world capital germania) by adolf hitler and albert speer. naming the square after another infamous fascist, italy’s benito mussolini, was also tossed around. germany’s postwar historical revisionism is part of the country’s “constitutional tradition of militant democracy,” which acts “against those who would use their liberties to undermine the democratic order,” according to russell miller, co-editor-in-chief of the german law journal. hitler and speer should have named the square after hitler’s benefactors on wall street, the bush crime family, the industrialist i.g. farben, general electric, standard oil, henry ford, international telephone and telegraph, the rockefeller-controlled vacuum oil company, and other transnationals and banksters who made the nazi nightmare possible. of course, that wouldn’t fit on a sign. this article was posted: friday, january 10, 2014 at 10:25 am related articles < !– this is where we need to show the related articles –> source: infowars source: http://rinf.com/alt-news/breaking-news/google-maps-renames-german-square-after-adolf-hitler/

Historical Figures and Events Continue to Haunt Modern Times

A recent surge in searches for Bitcoin and Blockchain has led some to draw parallels with the past, particularly when it comes to authoritarian regimes. The name of Adolf Hitler, once a symbol of fear and oppression, is being invoked by some as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power.

In 1943, Colonel Freiherr von Gersdorff attempted to assassinate Hitler at the Zeughaus Museum in Berlin, but his plan was foiled when Hitler left early. The would-be assassin had placed bombs in his pockets and intended to detonate them when they were close to Hitler.

Fast forward to today, where some are drawing comparisons between the Nazi regime's treatment of its citizens and modern-day policies on immigration. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced criticism for her handling of migrant policy, with some accusing her of prioritizing the interests of migrants over those of her own people.

In a bizarre twist, it has been revealed that Hitler's Christmas party in 1941 featured a swastika instead of an angel on top of the tree. The Nazi leader had replaced traditional Christmas celebrations with a holiday of the ""winter solstice,"" reflecting his disdain for Christianity.

Meanwhile, researchers have discovered a secret Nazi hideout in the Argentine jungle, which was allegedly used as a last resort in case of defeat during World War II.

As we navigate these complex issues, it's essential to remember that history is not always linear. The

Berlin's Architectural Landscape Under Scrutiny

As Germany continues to grapple with its complex past, the city's architectural landscape is facing renewed scrutiny. A recent design for a new Beijing axis has sparked debate about the influence of the country's tumultuous history on contemporary architecture.

Meanwhile, in Berlin, a prominent minister has been making headlines with his outspoken views on politics and society. The pastor, who was born into a family with a complicated past, has been credited with helping to shape Germany's post-war identity.

In another part of the city, a Jewish company is being recognized for its contributions to Berlin's cultural heritage. The foundry, which dates back to the 19th century, has produced iconic landmarks such as the Reichstag building.

However, not all of Berlin's architectural treasures are without controversy. A former government bunker, built in the 1970s, was recently abandoned due to high maintenance costs and concerns about its secrecy.

A new exhibit at the German Historical Museum is also sparking debate about Germany's role in World War II. The show focuses on the everyday ways that ordinary Germans accepted and celebrated the Nazi regime, rather than glorifying Hitler himself.

As Berlin continues to navigate its complex past, the city's architecture remains a source of fascination and controversy. With new developments and exhibits emerging regularly, it is clear that Germany's architectural landscape will remain a topic of interest for years to come.

In a move aimed at investing in the country's future, the White House has released a proposal to make community college tuition-free for the first two years. The ""America's College Promise"" plan prioritizes public investments in affordable education and could benefit up to 9 million American students enrolled in community colleges.

The plan requires students to attend college part-time, work towards completing a degree program, and maintain a 2.5 GPA. While details on the total cost of the program are not yet available, some critics have expressed concerns about the scope of the proposal.

Meanwhile, austerity measures are being felt across the country, with many colleges facing mass layoffs and reduced funding. This has led to increased waiting lists for students seeking higher education.

In a related development, community college presidents have announced that they will hold tuition increases to $5 or less per credit hour in the upcoming academic year. This decision aims to make education more affordable for students and families across the country.

The proposal also highlights the need for universities to adapt to changing times. Some institutions are embracing innovative approaches, such as eliminating in-state tuition requirements for flagship universities.

As the debate over education continues, it's clear that investing in our future requires bold action. The president's proposal is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address the pressing issues facing our country's students and institutions.","College Costs Soar, Leaving Students and Families Struggling

The cost of higher education in the United States is on the rise, with prices increasing at a rate faster than inflation. According to recent reports, the average price of college has risen by 6.6% at public institutions and 4.6% at private ones over the past few years.

While some colleges are experiencing significant increases in tuition, others are struggling to stay afloat due to declining state funding. In response, many institutions are turning to alternative sources of revenue, such as private donations.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration has proposed a new community college tuition plan, which aims to make higher education more accessible and affordable for students from low-income backgrounds. However, critics argue that the plan may not be effective in addressing the root causes of rising tuition costs.

As the cost of higher education continues to rise, many families are struggling to afford it. In some cases, students are forced to take on significant debt to finance their education. The situation is particularly dire for low-income students, who often rely on federal and state aid to cover the cost of tuition.

In an effort to address these issues, some states are exploring alternative solutions, such as free or reduced-tuition plans. For example, New York has proposed a plan called the Excelsior Scholarship, which would provide full tuition coverage to eligible students from middle-income families.

As the debate over higher education costs continues, one thing is clear: something needs to be done to make college more affordable and accessible for all students.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - investing in our future: president’s proposal promises free community college tuition
investing in our future: president’s proposal promises free community college tuition (before it's news) the white house has released a proposal to allow students to attend community college for free for their first two years if they work hard and keep their grades up. the “america’s college promise” plan prioritizes public investments in more affordable education and could benefit as many as 9 million american students enrolled in community colleges across the country. the plan would save full-time students an average of $$3,800 in tuition each year. “put simply, what i’d like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who’s willing to work for it—that’s right, free for everybody who’s willing to work for it,” explained president obama in a video message. the president and ceo of the american association of community colleges welcomed the announcement, saying, “college costs are a major concern for community college students. though our sector provides the most affordable entry into higher education, our institutions also serve the neediest students… [m]ore students would see college as a viable option as a result of this initiative.” the plan requires that students attend college at least part-time, work toward completion of a degree program, and maintain a 2.5 gpa. the white house hasn’t released any details about the total cost of the program, but that hasn’t stopped some from preemptively criticizing the scope of the proposal. one such critic, rep. diane

another screw the taxpayer scam (before it's news) diogenes middle finger obama to propose two free years of community college as we have learned, when a democrat uses the word free, they actually means bend over and smile taxpayers. and now barack is to propose in his upcoming state of disunion speech, free college tuition for community college students. “what i’d like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who’s willing to work for it.” his proposal would make two years free for students with a c+ average who attend school at least half-time and who are making “steady progress” toward their degree. and what about the free part? federal funding would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college, and obama is asking states to pick up the rest of the tab. (lean forward mr. and mrs. taxpayer). here’s the best part: community colleges must also adopt “promising and evidence-based institutional reforms to improve student outcomes”. reforms and improved student outcomes in the same sentence means just one thing in obama’s america, federal mandated rules and race based outcome. what we will get is is another delusional liberal dream program, our tax money haplessly given away to try and educate ghetto rats while they wile away their free time in weave salons or work on their rap careers while wasting educator’s time and resources better used for responsible students. while a program like this could be helpful for single mothers

austerity sledgehammer: at least half a million college students on waiting lists as loans dry up; colleges face mass layoffs % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) austerity measures, though unpopular and not discussed by government officials and media pundits, are in full effect across a broad spectrum of services and industries. in many parts of the country local governments are being forced to layoff or cut the salaries of thousands of emergency personnel. education spending cuts across debt behemoths like california, illionois and michigan are forcing elementary and high school classrooms to capacities exceeding thirty or forty students at a time and removing subjects like art, music and physical education from school schedules. towns and cities all over america are declaring bankruptcy on an almost weekly basis. government sponsored health care systems are feeling the pressure with major cuts in access to key prescription medications quickly becoming the norm. just two years ago the idea that austerity cuts would hit america like an 8-pound sledgehammer was inconceivable. today it’s become quite apparent, especially for those just entering college or returning to higher education in an effort to learn new skills for a dying or dead jobs market. in addition to nearly $$1 billion in state funding cuts for college students, the progressive state of california and others are now facing massive jobs cuts and salary reductions across the board. this is only going to get worse – it can be no other way: more than 470,000 community college students

Article 5 - who says universities aren’t conservative places?
who says universities aren’t conservative places? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! universities do not embrace change. sometimes they don’t even embrace talking about change. the boulder daily camera has done a short news article on my recent proposal in the chronicle of higher education that the state of colorado eliminate in-state tuition for its flagship university(ies). reached by a reporter my university offered this response: boulder campus spokesman bronson hilliard said that while the idea is interesting, cu officials aren’t considering it. there are too many constraints — such as a state law that requires cu’s freshman class to be made up of 55 percent in-state students, averaged over a three-year period. “if it were as easy to do as he posits in his piece, we probably would have done it years ago,” hilliard said. stymied by the law. of course, it is precisely that legal requirement that i’d like to see changed, so invoking it as an obstacle to change is really to miss the point. and there is no shortage of discussions about colorado by university officials — every year cu officials are complaining about colorado laws that have led to a reduction in state support. i guess those laws are ok to discuss changing. at the same time officials at cu and csu are not shy about the funding incentives that motivate them to look to out-of-state students as cash cows: cu, where the mix of students is 55 percent

Article 6 - new york screwing poor/disabled kids while also demanding free tuition for illegals
liberal values in a nutshell. according to a shocking report from reason magazine, affluent families in comrade bill de blasio’s new york city have successfully been suing the city and forcing it transfer their disabled children from the public school system into private schools at taxpayer expense. this is obviously a big no-no for various reasons, the primary one being that these successful suits are screwing over poor and/or disabled kids, who are forced to remain in the depleted public school system: though it works out well for the minority of parents able to sue, the city simply can’t afford to send every learning disabled kid to private school at an average cost of $55,000 per pupil. “it is draining hundreds of millions of dollars from classrooms that desperately need those resources,” says eric nadelstern, who served as the second-highest ranking education official under former mayor michael bloomberg, an independent whose administration fought back against families suing for private school tuition. though nadelstern acknowledges that the city’s special education offerings are lacking, he says that “diverting resources to a few is not a solution to the problem.” reason rightly notes that an ideal solution to this madness would be to offer all families school vouchers so they can decide whether to enroll their children in public school or a private school. of course, the leftists in nyc hate everything about school choice, so that’ll never happen. and this brings us to an even more appalling report from the new york post revealing that

why college costs so much (before it's news) from nypost.com it’s graduation season across america, a time when our politicos come out to bore us with their commencement orations. if only that’s all they did. unfortunately, they’re also doing their darnedest to ensure that the cost of a college degree is rising much faster than the ability to pay for it. former education secretary william bennett sums up a big part of the problem in a new book titled “is college worth it?” in it, he and his co-author note that since 1990 the cost of attending a four-year college has risen at four times the rate of inflation. over that same period, federally supported student loans have skyrocketed, to the point where student-loan debt now exceeds credit-card debt. continue reading at nypost.com… source: http://financialsurvivalnetwork.com/2013/05/why-college-costs-so-much/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-college-costs-so-much

Article 8 - understanding the illinois dream act (sb 2185)
understanding the illinois dream act (sb 2185) (before it's news) for 10 years, universities, business leaders, community groups, and immigrants have urged congress to pass the dream act. dream would enable undocumented students – brought to the us as children – to earn legal status by continuing their education or serving in the military. roughly 95,000 illinois youths would have benefited from dream. congress fell short of passing dream in december 2010. while the state of illinois cannot offer these students legal status, we can and should take small steps to ensure that everyone in our state has an opportunity to learn. that’s why we are proposing the illinois dream act. note: no new state dollars will be used by this bill. the scholarship is private dollars; drivers certificates funded by fees; volunteer commission will handle educating counselors. here’s what the illinois dream act would do: * good information. dream youths too often get incorrect information from high school counselors and college admissions officers regarding their college options. this bill would encourage these counselors and officers receive regular training regarding educational opportunities for immigrant youths. having accurate information would give dream youths the hope they need to continue their educations and help reduce the rates of high school dropouts. * education access. many qualified dream students do not have the financial resources to pursue college—and as a result their talents are wasted. an estimated 65% of dream youths come from households that earn below 200% of the poverty line

why and how democratic candidates should talk about education in 2012 (before it's news) so the “general election has begun” proclaims the hill, and the exhortations from the punditry are for candidates to either, shore up their base or move to the center. one interesting bit of advice, coming from more than one source, is for the candidates to “talk about education.” recent research results from the college board strongly suggest that advice may not be a bad idea. but if democratic candidates want to take that advice to heart, they need to develop more effective education talking points than what’s currently being conveyed. education is “top tier” in 2012 election according to the college board survey, “education is a top issue for voters in this year’s elections.” interesting data nuggets available in the pdf (link above) include: • 67 percent of the responders say education will be extremely important to them personally in this year’s elections for president and congress. • education ranks behind jobs and the economy (82 percent extremely important) and is on par with government spending (69 percent), health care (67 percent), and the federal budget deficit (64 percent). • three out of four voters say having a post-secondary degree or credential is important to achieving success in the workplace. • those most likely to be “education voters” in the 2012 elections are african americans (91 percent), hispanics (81 percent), democrats (79 percent), and

burlington, vt. – pressed by supporters of u.s. sen. bernie sanders, democratic party platform writers meeting this weekend in orlando, florida, adopted a progressive agenda that underscores the need for bold action on climate change, addresses criminal justice reform and calls for doubling the federal minimum wage.“we have made enormous strides,” sanders said. “thanks to the millions of people across the country who got involved in the political process – many for the first time – we now have the most progressive platform in the history of the democratic party.” the platform committee also adopted an amendment focused on criminal justice reform which calls for an investigation by the department of justice to investigate all shootings involving police officers. the platform that will be submitted at the democratic national convention later this month in philadelphia also would support congress putting a price on carbon and methane to discourage continued use of fossil fuels that are causing severe climate change. the platform also says lawmakers must consider the impact on the climate in all federal decisions and invest heavily in wind and solar power rather than natural gas. delegates allied with hillary clinton’s and sanders’ campaigns also passed amendments to fight for a $$15 federal minimum wage tied to inflation, urged passage of progressive immigration reform and called for the legalization of marijuana. the changes adopted this weekend in orlando improved platform language passed by drafters at a meeting last month in st. louis, missouri. the initial document already included commitments to abolish the death penalty, break up too-big-to

Article 1 - college costs rising at double the inflation rate
“the average price of college is continuing to rise more rapidly than the consumer price index, more rapidly than prices in the economy,” sandy baum, a co-author of the report who is a senior policy analyst for the college board and a professor at skidmore college, told reporters at a news conference this morning. she added that the prices “are probably higher than most of us want them to be.” those price hikes reflect increases in the sticker price that colleges advertise, though, ms. baum said, the average student does not pay that full amount. at public universities, the average student gets about $3,600 in grants and tax benefits, lowering the actual cost to around $2,600. at private institutions, aid totals about $9,300, bringing the cost to $14,400. but even the net price, after taking into account grants and other forms of aid, is rising more quickly than prices of other goods and than family incomes. in recent years, consumer prices have risen by less than 3 percent a year, while net tuition at public colleges has risen by 6.6 percent and at private ones, 4.6 percent. the changes in tuition at public institutions closely track changes in financing they receive from state governments and other public sources, the report found. when state and local support for public colleges declined over the last seven years, tuition and fees rose more quickly, and as state support has grown of late, the pace of increases fell,

Article 2 - parents’ night with the president
will the obamas choose the quaker-run sidwell, established in 1883 and described by some as the harvard of the three schools? (sidwell has already educated children of two sitting presidents, theodore roosevelt and bill clinton.) will they pick georgetown day, which became washington’s first integrated school in 1945 and is known for its informality (students call teachers by their first names) and its emphasis on diversity and social justice? or will they select maret, a smaller, more intimate academy founded in 1911 that would allow the first family to keep both children on one enclosed campus? photo the obamas and their aides declined to discuss the family’s inclinations, and no one knows how their choice may ultimately affect washington’s social landscape. city officials say the obamas have not visited any public schools here, and their daughters, who attend private school in chicago, are not expected to switch course. but those are only details. all across town, parents are already dreamily envisioning casual chats with the president and first lady at soccer practices and pta meetings, while little girls are swooning over the prospect of white house sleepovers with the daughters of the nation’s first black president. “with this particular president, there’s so much excitement,” said natalie wexler, a novelist whose daughter caught a glimpse of mrs. obama at sidwell last monday. “anything or anyone connected to him is going to be exciting

Article 3 - obama, in tennessee, begins selling his community college tuition plan
“you’re always better off letting states mimic each other,” he told reporters before the president’s remarks. even if his plan gains no traction in congress, the president is laying claim to a big idea at a time when lawmakers are planning to renegotiate the higher education act that governs federal financing of college education. democrats believe that tackling the cost of college is an issue that plays to their strengths — one they can run on in 2016. still, not all of them were comfortable with the plan. representative steve cohen, democrat of tennessee, questioned mr. obama’s choice to model his plan after his state’s community college initiative, arguing that the program helps more affluent and lower-achieving students rather than those with the greatest financial need and the best chance of excelling academically. ""he shouldn’t be holding tennessee promise out as a model because it’s not a model; it’s a facade to cover up what is a dying system that hasn’t been funded,"" said mr. cohen, an architect of tennessee’s hope college program, which rewards students for achievement. mr. obama’s plan, which states would have to opt into, would not help students at for-profit colleges, widening the cost advantage that community colleges have over the for-profits. it is the latest in a series of steps the administration has taken that would undermine the for-profit sector, whose students tend to accumulate more debt and have poorer job prospects. some public four

Article 4 - how can community colleges get a piece of the billions that donors give to higher education?
when gail o. mellow became the president of laguardia 13 years ago, there was no mechanism in place for raising private money. “because of who we are and who we serve, the likelihood of one of our students becoming bill gates or the c.e.o. of g.e. is, i’m not going to say zero, but much, much smaller than if you were at williams,” dr. mellow said recently. “we don’t have a tradition of giving to colleges in our communities, even though these colleges are so hugely important to their local economies” — referring to the labor force they supply. the chief impediments to fund-raising at community colleges are the most obvious ones: there is no base of well-off alumni from which to draw, and no accompanying reserve of pride that might be exploited. community colleges are places of departure rather than arrival. a gilded education begets more privilege, and privilege itself has had a long tradition of expression in munificent reciprocal giving. at community colleges, there exists not a legacy culture but whatever might be considered its opposite, given that the ambition of anyone who makes it through the system successfully is to send a child somewhere far beyond it. when students from a community college ascend to the affluent classes, they tend to feel a stronger affinity to the institutions that eventually graduate them than to the places where, often, they had no option but to begin. roosevelt i. northern blvd. long island city queens

Article 5 - administration outlines proposed changes to ‘no child’ law
the obama administration said on monday that it would ask congress to raise education spending by about $3.5 billion, a 7.5 percent increase, for the 2011 fiscal year, even as it sought to limit other categories of domestic spending. in outlining its budget request, the administration also said it would seek an extensive rewrite of the main federal law governing public schools, known as no child left behind , and would seek to replace the law’s much-criticized system for rating schools based on student test scores. the administration proposed replacing that system, known as adequate yearly progress, with a new accountability system that officials said would more fairly characterize schools’ academic progress. “we want accountability reforms that factor in student growth, progress in closing achievement gaps, proficiency towards college and career-ready standards, high school graduation and college enrollment rates,” education secretary arne duncan said in announcing the proposed changes. “we know that’s a lot to track, but if we want to be smarter about accountability, more fair to students and teachers and more effective in the classroom, we need to look at all of these factors.” advertisement continue reading the main story the administration asked for $49.7 billion in discretionary spending increases for the department of education for the 2011 fiscal year, up from $46.2 billion in the current year. those figures do not include mandatory spending on programs that require no annual congressional appropriation, a category that includes pell grants for college students. the administration’s budget

Article 6 - mississippi near settlement in rights case
one of the nation's longest-running civil rights cases neared a settlement today when the state of mississippi agreed to spend $500 million to improve its historically black colleges and speed their integration. the case began in 1975 when jake ayers, a black sharecropper, sued the state on behalf of his son, contending that mississippi's three black universities -- jackson state, alcorn state and mississippi valley state -- were vastly inferior to the colleges that whites attended. a series of federal courts agreed, noting that the black colleges received far less money per student, and in 1992 the united states supreme court said the state would have to do more than simply adopt race-neutral admissions policies. the court ruled that mississippi would also have to reform its discriminatory spending and education policies. the state agreed to spend $246 million over 17 years on academic programs and $75 million over five years for capital improvements and buildings. it would also establish a $70 million endowment to provide a regular income to the colleges and would raise an additional $35 million for the endowment from donors. the balance of the $500 million would pay for other programs, including summer school for high school students. as an incentive to promote diversity, the state would allow the colleges to control the interest from the endowment if they achieved 10 percent nonblack enrollment for three consecutive years. (the colleges are almost entirely black.) the deal was approved by the state, the united states department of

Article 7 - competitive student loans
to the editor: re “helping students, not lenders” (editorial, march 4): while you praise the proposal to eliminate the federal family education loan program, you do not factor in the choice and valuable services offered to student borrowers that are a product of the competition between the federal family education loan program and the government’s direct loan program. the nationalization of student lending would eliminate those benefits and hurt the very students the proposal intends to help. the claim that the direct loan program is “less expensive” is tenuous at best, as originating all loans through the direct loan program during the next five years would require roughly $500 billion in new treasury borrowing. in the end, we’re confident that federal policy makers will closely scrutinize this proposal, as well as potential alternatives, before terminating a successful 40-year-old program with proven results in providing college access and opportunity for millions of students. peter warren president, education finance council washington, march 5, 2009  to the editor: why do you not support free-market principles in student loans with the same tenacity that you support them in other areas? you endorse a proposal by the obama administration to abolish guaranteed loans, thereby eliminating all consumer choice and competition in federal student loans. advertisement continue reading the main story in an editorial about the airline industry in 2007, you wrote that the government “could have gone further and opened up the american market to more competition, and the superior service and lower prices

Article 8 - the limits of educational largess
the college's tuition and finances were put in doubt recently when the county executive, thomas s. gulotta, threatened to cut the college's proposed $135.7 million budget. he rejected a proposed tax increase to pay for increased costs and instead recommended a $95-a-year tuition increase. the county legislature rejected his plan and developed a compromise plan that included a tax increase smaller than the one urged by the college and restored some, but not all of the proposed cuts. tuition was increased by $50. the negotiations raised questions about the college's worth to nassau county, which in theory is supposed to account for a third of the college's budget, with the state and student tuition paying the rest. given the county's budget crisis, should and could it continue to support the school? county legislators responded with a resounding yes when they approved a tax increase of $3.85 a year for the average homeowner, to be devoted solely to the college budget. the measure was approved unanimously and was thus veto-proof. but mr. gulotta said he disagreed with the tax increase because ''i believe very strongly that wherever possible, only the people who utilize services should pay for those services, not the general public.'' legislators argued that sustaining n.c.c., the largest undergraduate college in the state, should be a priority. ''it's one of the county's anchors,'' said judith a. jacobs, the legislature's democratic majority leader. ''long island is very often looking for areas

Article 9 - what's in the new student loan proposal
higher-education experts say the obama administration has proposed the broadest overhaul of federal college aid programs in decades. but for all the focus on the size of the budget, it has been hard to tell just what this means for students and their families. one problem is that whatever the president proposes, congress actually holds the purse strings. so there is no way to know just what aid will really be available down the road. but based on what administration officials have said, here is a summary of how the budget as proposed would affect funds available to help pay for college. the first important thing to understand is that the proposed benefits will not be available until july 1, 2010 — more than a year from now. here are the major administration proposals: pell grants in years past, the size of pell grants, which go to the neediest students, depended on the budget in a particular year. the administration’s proposal would end that. advertisement continue reading the main story also, beginning in the 2010-11 academic year, the maximum pell grant would rise with inflation; the grant would be indexed to the consumer price index plus 1 percent. over all, the maximum pell grant in 2010-11 would be $5,550, up from $4,731 in the current year (note that the size of the grant awarded to an individual student depends on that student’s financial circumstances).

Article 10 - cuomo tuition plan stands to help students make ‘the last mile’
“there’s a significant number of potential students — folks who live in the north country — who just think that college is not for them, and find the thicket of financial aid guidelines daunting,” she added. new york already offers in-state students at its state and city universities, which are attended by 400,000 full-time students, one of the lowest tuition rates in the nation. at four-year state university of new york schools, the tuition for residents is $6,470; at two-year community colleges, it is $4,350. full-time costs for city university of new york schools are similar. for the poorest students, whose families make less than $30,000 a year, federal pell grants, which top out at $5,775 per year, already pay for a large portion of tuition costs. the state also provides nearly $1 billion via its tuition assistance program, which sets an adjusted gross income limit just under $100,000. those awards are capped at $5,165; many grants are smaller. as broadly envisioned, mr. cuomo’s plan, called the excelsior scholarship, would be aimed at students and their families who made an adjusted gross income between $55,000 and $125,000 a year, said jim malatras, the director of state operations. after verifying whether applicants had received federal and state aid or other money, the scholarship program would help eligible families make “the last mile,” mr. malatras said

Title: ‘free’ community college already costs 50 percent more than originally estimated
Content: (before it's news) this week a couple of legislators and secretary of education arne duncan released the draft legislation of the proposed “free community college” plan barack obama introduced in january. probably the most important detail is that the federal government itself now estimates the cost of providing a “free” community college education jumping from $$60 billion to $$90 billion. matthew disler at real clear politics explains some of the latest information here. in addition to subsidizing community college attendance, it also directs some money toward colleges that privately serve minorities. for those who missed the whole thing, here are the basics: president barack obama and several leading democrats want to make community college free for students who would then transfer to four-year colleges for bachelor’s degrees and for those who are in training programs for occupations that the state determines to be part of an “in-demand industry sector.” the federal government will pay two-thirds of the cost, but states will have to chip in one-third to participate. the bill (pdf) would limit annual tuition increases to 3 percent of the total tuition. this will prevent any outrageous increases in order to milk the program, but it also essentially incentivizes an annual increase in tuition in every single state, which presumably would also affect students who don’t qualify for this program. the legislation does restrict states to offering free tuition to “first-time” students only, thus trying to avoid dealing with students dropping out and dropping back in later, which, frankly, is one of the actual beneficial features of community college if you’re poor. it requires students to attend school at least half-time, keep their grades up, and the gravy train cuts off after three years, regardless of whether the student has completed his or her education. note, though, that if a state ends up with leftover money from this program, they can spend it in a number of different listed ways, including expanding who qualifies for money. i have said before that this program is a subsidy for colleges and more specifically college administrators, and nothing in the draft legislation convinces me otherwise. the students will actually never see a cent of this money. it will all be handled with waivers. it is not a loan. if the student drops out or flunks out in a year, the money is lost (to the taxpayers, not to the college the money had been distributed to). this incentivizes colleges keeping students on board and giving them good grades, even if they aren’t learning anything or are ultimately incapable of handling college-level material. it also mandates community college systems provide plans for “institutional reforms and innovative practices to improve student outcomes.” i suppose writing on a slip of paper “grade inflation!” would not qualify. the act doesn’t mandate anything in particular, but it does give a bunch of suggestions, such as more mentoring and student supports services, more accelerated learning opportunities, course redesigns, and strengthening remedial programs to account for the massive failures of our other program that provides “

President Proposes Free Community College Tuition

In a move aimed at investing in the country's future, the White House has released a proposal to make community college tuition-free for the first two years. The ""America's College Promise"" plan prioritizes public investments in affordable education and could benefit up to 9 million American students enrolled in community colleges.

The plan requires students to attend college part-time, work towards completing a degree program, and maintain a 2.5 GPA. While details on the total cost of the program are not yet available, some critics have expressed concerns about the scope of the proposal.

Meanwhile, austerity measures are being felt across the country, with many colleges facing mass layoffs and reduced funding. This has led to increased waiting lists for students seeking higher education.

In a related development, community college presidents have announced that they will hold tuition increases to $5 or less per credit hour in the upcoming academic year. This decision aims to make education more affordable for students and families across the country.

The proposal also highlights the need for universities to adapt to changing times. Some institutions are embracing innovative approaches, such as eliminating in-state tuition requirements for flagship universities.

As the debate over education continues, it's clear that investing in our future requires bold action. The president's proposal is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to address the pressing issues facing our country's students and institutions.

College Costs Soar, Leaving Students and Families Struggling

The cost of higher education in the United States is on the rise, with prices increasing at a rate faster than inflation. According to recent reports, the average price of college has risen by 6.6% at public institutions and 4.6% at private ones over the past few years.

While some colleges are experiencing significant increases in tuition, others are struggling to stay afloat due to declining state funding. In response, many institutions are turning to alternative sources of revenue, such as private donations.

Meanwhile, the Obama administration has proposed a new community college tuition plan, which aims to make higher education more accessible and affordable for students from low-income backgrounds. However, critics argue that the plan may not be effective in addressing the root causes of rising tuition costs.

As the cost of higher education continues to rise, many families are struggling to afford it. In some cases, students are forced to take on significant debt to finance their education. The situation is particularly dire for low-income students, who often rely on federal and state aid to cover the cost of tuition.

In an effort to address these issues, some states are exploring alternative solutions, such as free or reduced-tuition plans. For example, New York has proposed a plan called the Excelsior Scholarship, which would provide full tuition coverage to eligible students from middle-income families.

As the debate over higher education costs continues, one thing is clear: something needs to be done to make

The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE has a more general tone and does not provide specific information about the Yellowstone cutthroat trout or its conservation status.","Conservation Efforts in the Great Lakes Region Gain Momentum

The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has expressed enthusiasm over recent announcements regarding the delisting of wolves in the Great Lakes states. The federal government's decision to remove gray wolf populations from the list of threatened and endangered species is seen as a significant step towards restoring balance between predator and prey species.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has also taken action, ordering the state's Department of Natural Resources to begin implementing its own science-based wolf management plan. This move aims to ensure that wolf populations are managed sustainably, without compromising other species such as elk and deer.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, conservation efforts are underway to protect iconic wildlife habitats. In Virginia, a annual wild pony round-up is taking place at Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, with the goal of maintaining the health of the local ecosystem.

In addition, national parks are offering ranger-led hikes and interpretive programs to educate visitors about the natural and cultural significance of these areas. For example, Yellowstone National Park will open its winter season on December 15th, allowing visitors to explore the park's stunning landscapes by snowmobile or snowcoach.

As the country continues to grapple with issues related to conservation and wildlife management, it is heartening to see efforts underway to protect our natural resources for future generations. By supporting organizations like the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and national parks like Yellowstone, we can help ensure that these incredible ecosystems continue to thrive.","""Wildlife Corridors and the Unseen Forces Shaping Our World""

In the vast expanse of our planet, there exist hidden forces that shape the very fabric of our ecosystems. From the majestic mountains to the dense forests, wildlife corridors weave together disparate habitats, creating a complex tapestry of life.

Take Montana, for instance, where the presence of trout has drawn in humans from far and wide. The state's rugged landscape, dotted with rivers and lakes, has become a haven for anglers and nature enthusiasts alike. But it's not just the trout that have made this place special – it's the unique blend of geography, climate, and human activity that has created an environment teeming with life.

In other parts of the world, such as Madagascar, scientists are working to protect the island's incredible biodiversity. Home to a staggering array of unique species, Madagascar is often referred to as the ""eighth continent."" Efforts to preserve its natural wonders are underway, but challenges abound, including poverty and habitat destruction.

Meanwhile, in the United States, wildlife experts are grappling with the consequences of human activity on native species. In some areas, such as Westchester County, New York, deer populations have grown to alarming levels, causing ecosystem disruptions that can be felt far beyond the local environment.

As we explore these complex ecosystems, it becomes clear that there are unseen forces at play – forces that shape our world in ways both subtle and profound. By understanding these dynamics, we may uncover new insights into the delicate balance of nature and our place within it.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

why the bison are running in yellowstone (before it's news) here is the comment from the person who filmed the running bison: “march 14, 2014 — this herd of yellowstone national park bison dashes from mammoth hot springs eastward along the roadway and deeper into the park. if the herd matriarch gets the urge to run, she will … and the entire herd will run to keep up. sometimes i can tell, i can feel that this running is a celebration of life — running for the sheer joy of being able to.” it is spring. my cow is frolicking around like a kid, too. to bring that video here as some sort of evidence that yellowstone is about to blow is not only ridiculous, it is disinformation. not that anyone seems to mind disinformation around here, as long as the headline gets clicks! folks, if we want an alternative media worth having, we have to stop buying into the nonsense. if you want sensationalism and fearmpongering spin, go back to the msm.

Article 1 - a trout-centric history of montana, with latte
i was thinking about these effects when i took a break from fishing to pick up an iced latte at a drive-through espresso bar, and later when i tasted the bison and chèvre empanadas at the big sky food festival. i also thought about it when i talked to people here and in the nearby town of bozeman who were from new york and minnesota and other parts east, and when i chatted with a recent emigrant from los angeles at the salt lake city airport. what i thought was: look what fishing can do to a place. there are still a few people left in montana who were born here. i even know one or two. eastern montana, far from the rockies and deep in drought, is full of them. but in cities like bozeman, rimmed by mountains and graced with magnificent rivers, my unscientific survey suggests that the alien invaders, with their salsa and their fine cabernets, are spreading like rainbow trout. my theory is that the alien fish species caused the human invasion. i know there are other factors contributing to montana's popularity, like the rocky mountains, glacier national park, yellowstone national park, grizzly bears and wolves, pure mountain lakes, evergreen forests, skiing, hiking, kayaking and a night sky that makes you want to break up into your component atoms and float into the milky way. still, i think it's mostly about the trout. here's

Article 2 - on madagascar, a treasury of fauna and flora
''we hope it might entice people into eco-tourism,'' said dr. steve goodman, an ornithologist and mammalogist who lives in madagascar and works for the field museum in chicago. he was co-editor of the book with dr. jonathan p. benstead, an ecologist at the marine biological laboratory in woods hole. by helping to spur the growth of a still tiny eco-tourism industry (as a similar book did in costa rica early in its conservation efforts), the authors hope to help protect madagascar's remaining forests from slash-and-burn farming and the pressures put on wild areas by the country's overwhelming poverty. scientists are already praising the book as a landmark account of a disappearing biological treasure. ''nowhere has evolution been more richly and uniquely illustrated than on madagascar,'' wrote dr. peter h. raven, director of the missouri botanical garden, calling the book ''an indispensable, encyclopedic account of the world's no. 1 conservation priority.'' madagascar is rife with biological superlatives, as scientists say it is home to the greatest diversity of native, unique species to be found on any island, with every canyon and cliffside and wetland harboring different forms of life. ''it's remarkable,'' dr. goodman said. ''you just go across a river and everything changes. it's basically like they're things from another world.'' evolution on this island, about the size of

Article 3 - old, but unready to be rung out
red-tailed hawks are large, adaptable birds of prey that breed from canada to panama. this one was almost certainly born north of new york city, and she was captured and banded on oct. 15, 1983 — coincidentally, by personnel at dr. soucy’s center. she has almost certainly traveled far since then, but her current acclaim began on nov. 15 when a motorist, worried that the bird would be hit by a car, stopped to pick her up after seeing her feeding on a rabbit carcass in the road. when the bird didn’t fight him and wouldn’t let the rabbit go, he figured there was something wrong with her and put her in the back of his van, where she perched on a mop handle. photo there were a few stops and missteps. she escaped when a worker at sterling forest state park in new york tried to transport her in a banker’s box, but she was picked up the next day on the same highway and taken to the bear mountain zoo, and then to suzie gilbert, a wild-bird rehabilitator in garrison, n.y. ms. gilbert fed her for a few days, realized the hawk had a respiratory problem of some kind that needed extra care and took her to dr. soucy’s raptor center, where the red-tail has been given food, medicine and treatment for a hairline fracture of a wing. the bird will be fed and observed

Article 4 - wyoming rivers produce trophies
golden trout originated in the sierra nevada mountains of california, but they seldom exceed a pound in their native waters. goldens were first introduced to the wind river's barren lakes in the 1940's, carried in crates on the backs of horses and released in select waters. those fish immediately took hold. wyoming's current state record golden, which was taken in the wind rivers at cook lake in 1948, weighed 11 pounds! i was looking for the world-record golden -- a fish weighing 12 to 15 pounds -- during my two-week, 100-mile trek through the winds. i was armed with three flyrods, an assortment of sinking and floating flylines, several hundred fly patterns, enough pasta to satisfy the most staunch italian and a professional photographer to record the historic catch. we began our quest at the northern edge of the mountain range, covering nine miles of nasty trail to reach a lake high above timberline. i felt as if i were on top of the world, but my legs were incredibly shaky, my muscles twitching uncontrollably. unfortunately, the lake held no goldens, although i did catch and release several nice cutthroats, including a 17-inch slab. the following day we climbed four grueling miles to a lake once known to contain big goldens. i fished that lake, which rested at 11,200 feet, for several hours without sighting a fish, let alone garnering a strike. it was

Article 6 - eastern cougar is declared extinct, with an asterisk
seven decades after the last reported sighting of the eastern cougar, the federal fish and wildlife service declared it extinct wednesday and recommended that it be removed from the nation’s endangered species list. there’s one wrinkle, though: it may not be extinct, exactly. scientists are moving toward the conclusion that the eastern cougar was erroneously classified as a separate subspecies in the first place. as a result of a genetic study conducted in 2000, most biologists now believe there is no real difference between the western and eastern branches of the cougar family. either way, the “eastern” cougar as such is no longer with us. any recent sightings in the cougar’s historic range, which stretched from eastern ontario and michigan eastward to maine and southward to georgia, tennessee and missouri, were actually sightings of its relatives, the fish and wildlife service said. “it’s extinct,” said mark mccollough, a wildlife biologist with the agency’s offices in maine, referring to the official determination by his agency. advertisement continue reading the main story “but it’s not?” he was asked. “but it’s not,” he confirmed. “it may well return to part of its range.”

Article 7 - country preserves
barbara brummer recently found herself doing the naturalist's version of checking a house's faucets: she kept turning over rotting logs. dr. brummer, executive director of the nature conservancy in new jersey, was looking for salamanders, particularly the threatened long-tailed variety. if dr. brummer is a giddy new homeowner, then the house under examination is a sprawling tract of land in fredon township, n.j., whose amenities include black bears, threatened northern cricket frogs, bullfrogs, garter snakes, copperheads, black snakes, gray and red foxes, coyotes, barred owls, otters and great blue herons. oh, and the sellers, adam and zena rudzki, haven't quite moved out. the rudzkis, who had owned the property since 1983, sold 86 acres to the nonprofit conservancy this fall to be preserved forever, while they continue to live on the remaining 20 acres, which will remain in the family's hands. the arrangement, though atypical, is not unheard of. the land forms a welcome connection between the nearby muckshaw ponds preserve and the 1,900-acre whittingham wildlife management area. sussex county, fredon township, the open space trust fund, the state green acres program and private foundations also contributed to the $430,000 purchase -- a bargain sale. advertisement continue reading the main story mrs. rudzki, 

Article 8 - at berryessa national monument, wildflowers and rebirth
what do we want from our wildlife areas? something so remote we’ll never see it? or something close enough, braided into our tangle of civilization, to remind us of all that exists alongside us in this world? when theodore roosevelt signed the 1906 antiquities act into law, he gave presidents the power to protect cultural, historic and natural resources under threat with the national monument designation. more than a century later, millions of acres of public lands have been protected, many across the american west. they include the pacific remote islands, the largest marine reserve in the world, which was proclaimed by george w. bush and expanded by barack obama, and the grand staircase-escalante in utah, an astounding, alien landscape of plateaus and cliff faces created by sedimentary erosion, chock-full of fossils. this year, 27 national monuments were made newly vulnerable to oil, gas and other resource extraction, placed under review by president trump for what he deems as presidential overreach amounting to a “massive federal land grab.” but it’s important to note that these places were never meant to be walled off or untouchable. they’re meant to be explored. designated by mr. obama two years ago, berryessa snow mountain was a complicated puzzle of orphaned lands managed by a host of government agencies. but looking at the pieces together now, you’ll see they make up a rich wildlife corridor amounting to a third

Article 9 - brazil's wildlife, right outside your lodge room
the transpantaneira highway, despite its grand name, is an unfinished dirt road running 90 or so miles from the brazilian town of pocone into the pantanal, a vast wetlands many consider south america's finest destination for animal viewing. but it's not just a road: it's a crocodilian slalom course. as i jolted along in a rented fiat uno on a late august night, my headlights caught the glare of dozens of red eyes staring in the near pitch-black far ahead. they belonged to yacare caimans, alligator cousins that had decided the road was a comfortable resting spot. there are literally millions of caimans in the pantanal, and they don't make way for anyone. so i weaved around them, remembering the story that the car rental agent had told me just a few hours earlier about the time he had to sleep in his truck because the road was so caiman-covered he couldn't get by. i was luckier: minutes later, i was turning onto the road to pousada rio clarinho, the first of two lodges i would stay at during my pantanal trip. there were no more caimans, but the road through dense woods was winding and deeply rutted, slowing me to a bumpy crawl. i flipped on my high beams as i rounded a curve, slammed on the brakes and uttered a very loud, very profane expression of surprise. just 10 feet ahead

Article 10 - in the wild, wild backyard
take deer, for example. they are around every bend, eating plantings in yards, running into cars and, in woodsy areas, wiping out the understory of plant life that is home to birds and other smaller animals. but rather than blaming the animals, dr. klemens uses a new umbrella term to embrace the species that are thriving on humans' turf. subsidized species, he calls them. ''canada geese, deer, purple loosestrife, skunks, opossum, snapping turtles, bullfrogs -- they're all here because we subsidize them,'' he said. no one knows how many deer are in westchester. the new york state department of environmental conservation uses an arcane formula involving hunting statistics to arrive at a statewide guesstimate. that number was 750,000 in 1989. but it has grown to more than 1,100,000 today, of which about 2 percent, or 20,000, call westchester home, according to a department spokeswoman, maureen wren, who added that the deer population in new york has stabilized in recent years, a trend typical of the entire northeast. stabilized? westchester residents might argue. ''we have a large deer population, which is having very severe ecosystem perturbations,'' dr. klemens said. ''the disturbance from deer is more than just the annoyance of running into cars and eating your ornamentals. the deer are altering irreparably the

Title: yellowstone cutthroat faces troubled waters
Content: if location is paramount, in wilderness experiences as in real estate, the cutthroat trout can lay claim to the most beautiful location in the world: yellowstone national park. although this native salmonid is not credited with the wits and wiliness of the brown trout or blessed with the acrobatic prowess of the rainbow, the cutthroat has considerable virtues, among them the most thrilling head-to-tail rise. casting to these creatures in the primordial surroundings of the park's buffalo ford when jewel-like pale morning duns are hatching and cutthroat roil the slick surface of the stream with their gluttonous riseforms is as close as most of us will get to an encounter with virgin america. but, alarmingly, all is not well in paradise. ""the yellowstone cutthroat as well as the park's population of grayling"" -- a distant cousin of the brook trout -- ""are at the threshold of endangered,"" said dr. todd koel, a fisheries biologist who has led yellowstone park cutthroat studies since 2001. koel made that observation when he visited with concerned anglers in manhattan last month in hopes of opening minds, and perhaps wallets, to the plight of the cutthroat. before the introduction of the laker, the yellowstone cutthroat lived in a pristine ecosystem kept inviolate by the great falls of the yellowstone, whose 417 feet of cataracts proved impassable to non-native species like the rainbow. this close relative of the cutthroat has swamped the gene pool in the lower yellowstone. the upper yellowstone system, though, remains the uncontested domain of the saving remnant of the cutthroat. advertisement continue reading the main story in addition to the predatory lake trout (each of which consumes an average of 41 cutthroat a year), the assault of whirling disease has wreaked nearly 100 percent mortality in such prime spawning habitat as pelican creek, where an annual run of 30,000 fish has effectively disappeared.

Conservation Efforts in the Great Lakes Region Gain Momentum

The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has expressed enthusiasm over recent announcements regarding the delisting of wolves in the Great Lakes states. The federal government's decision to remove gray wolf populations from the list of threatened and endangered species is seen as a significant step towards restoring balance between predator and prey species.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has also taken action, ordering the state's Department of Natural Resources to begin implementing its own science-based wolf management plan. This move aims to ensure that wolf populations are managed sustainably, without compromising other species such as elk and deer.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, conservation efforts are underway to protect iconic wildlife habitats. In Virginia, a annual wild pony round-up is taking place at Mount Rogers National Recreation Area, with the goal of maintaining the health of the local ecosystem.

In addition, national parks are offering ranger-led hikes and interpretive programs to educate visitors about the natural and cultural significance of these areas. For example, Yellowstone National Park will open its winter season on December 15th, allowing visitors to explore the park's stunning landscapes by snowmobile or snowcoach.

As the country continues to grapple with issues related to conservation and wildlife management, it is heartening to see efforts underway to protect our natural resources for future generations. By supporting organizations like the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and national parks like Yellowstone, we can help ensure that these incredible ecosystems continue to thrive.

""Wildlife Corridors and the Unseen Forces Shaping Our World""

In the vast expanse of our planet, there exist hidden forces that shape the very fabric of our ecosystems. From the majestic mountains to the dense forests, wildlife corridors weave together disparate habitats, creating a complex tapestry of life.

Take Montana, for instance, where the presence of trout has drawn in humans from far and wide. The state's rugged landscape, dotted with rivers and lakes, has become a haven for anglers and nature enthusiasts alike. But it's not just the trout that have made this place special – it's the unique blend of geography, climate, and human activity that has created an environment teeming with life.

In other parts of the world, such as Madagascar, scientists are working to protect the island's incredible biodiversity. Home to a staggering array of unique species, Madagascar is often referred to as the ""eighth continent."" Efforts to preserve its natural wonders are underway, but challenges abound, including poverty and habitat destruction.

Meanwhile, in the United States, wildlife experts are grappling with the consequences of human activity on native species. In some areas, such as Westchester County, New York, deer populations have grown to alarming levels, causing ecosystem disruptions that can be felt far beyond the local environment.

As we explore these complex ecosystems, it becomes clear that there are unseen forces at play – forces that shape our world in ways both subtle and profound. By understanding these dynamics, we may uncover new

For beer enthusiasts, a trip to Vermont is a must-visit destination. Waterbury, in particular, has earned the title of ""best beer town in New England."" With its wide array of pubs serving hard-to-find brews, it's no wonder that visitors flock to this charming town.

But what about those looking for a unique wine experience? In Germany, a four-star hotel in Göstling an der Ybbs offers a special ""Genießerzimmer"" – a room designed to make guests feel at home with local touches. This concept is not limited to hotels; many wine shops are now incorporating similar designs into their stores.

For those who prefer beer over wine, Belgium is the ultimate destination. From Saison Dupont's farmhouse-style ale to Piraat Ale's boisterous golden IPA, there's a brew for every palate. And with its rich history and unique brewing techniques, it's no wonder that Belgian beers are consistently ranked among the best in the world.

But beer isn't the only drink worth exploring. In South Africa, a self-guided safari to Kruger National Park offers breathtaking views of the African bush.

The craft beer scene has also inspired new events, such as the ""Birds on Tap Roadtrip"" tour, which combines birdwatching with beer tasting. This phenomenon is not unique to the United States, with similar tours taking place in Maine and other locations.

cheers! lager yeast origins discovered in patagonia % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) yuengling, pilsner, bock—these beers represent a large spread of malted barley beers commonly drunk in bars all around the world. as far as scientists and beer experts have been able to track, lagers were originally crafted in bavaria, a state in germany. however, the origins of one particular strain of yeast used to first make lager was only unearthed recently. lagers today are made with a hybrid yeast, a hybrid that formed from saccharomyces cerevisiae and a mysterious parent recently discovered in patagonia, south america: s.eubayanus. it was discovered by josé paul sampaio, a microbiologist working at the universidade nova de lisboa in portugal, while cataloging yeast species in the mountains of patagonia. sampaio and his team were classifying the yeasts they collected by their gene sequences, and they recognized that eubayanus was similar to known beer yeasts, especially s. carlsbergensis. eubayanus was an important parent in today’s lager hybrid because it prefers cool temperatures, allowing beer to be made in cooler climes. the eubayanus strain grows in galls—hard, sugar-rich lumps formed by insects laying their eggs on leaves—on birch trees.

Article 9 - the great canned vs bottled beer debate 2.0: craft brewing weighs in
the great canned vs bottled beer debate 2.0: craft brewing weighs in headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! in the early part of the 20th century, beer drinkers had only two choices when it came to quenching their thirst for a delicious frothy beverage: draught beer or bottles. it wasn’t until the 1930s that canned beer arrived on the scene. initially, tin cans could not withstand the carbonated pressure and burst. eventually, technological developments and the introduction of a vinyl liner proved successful in containing the pressure. then in 1935, kruger’s brewery of new jersey introduced the first canned beer–kruger’s finest beer–to the market, revolutionizing the beer industry. the canned versus bottled beer debate has raged ever since, and now the emerging mircrobrew trend is putting a new spin on the topic. the traditional debate has centered on factors including taste, convenience, and cost. beer is a sensitive beverage and exposure to both light and oxygen results in off-flavors. the caps on bottles are not completely airtight, creating a chemical reaction between oxygen and the hops, whereas cans are impervious to both light and oxygen, protecting the flavor, reducing chances of creating a “skunky” amora, and extending the shelf life. although proponents of bottles have remained steadfast in the claim that cans produce a metallic taste, there has been little empirical evidence to support the claim. additionally

from my window, i could see the jagged spires of the city’s most imposing church, the cathedral of ss. peter and paul, rising behind the baroque buildings on the other side of the square, while the tall, ornate parnas fountain, built in 1695, looked almost within reach. the three spurting gargoyle spouts at the base of the fountain reminded me of my growing thirst. i decided to try one of the new craft bars i’d heard about. but before i did, i made an impromptu stop for a half-liter of traditional czech svetly lezak, or pale lager, at u richarda, a taproom and restaurant for the u richarda microbrewery on the city’s outskirts. i had visited the brewery a decade earlier, and while coming across the new location was a surprise, the familiar bready taste of u richarda’s excellent unfiltered lager was just as i’d remembered it. photo but now it was time to try something new: a bar called jbm brew lab. i turned down a narrow residential street featuring some great examples of brno’s celebrated functionalist architecture, and found the pub in the middle of the block. taking its name from the owners’ initials, jbm was narrow, warm, boisterous and blissfully smoke-free, unlike many of the country’s traditional pubs. the beer list, too, was up to date, as well as international,

photo craft beer is usually not what comes to mind when thinking about orlando. walt disney world, universal studios or another splashy theme park, yes, but not beer. today, however, this landlocked central florida city is getting a reputation for its growing craft beer scene. in the past few years, locals in the orlando area have opened bars offering a wide selection of beers from small producers, and some are even opening spots that serve ales brewed in house. the florida brewers guild, a nonprofit association, said there are now 20 to 25 breweries and craft beer bars in the orlando area compared with five years ago when there were fewer than 10. photo the roots of the growing culture date to the opening of beer-centric bars like redlight redlight beer parlour (2810 corrine drive, orlando; 407-893-9832; redlightredlightbeerparlour.com). this casual and large bar, housed in an industrial-looking space, was a novelty when it opened in 2005. it has a menu of 26 rotating drafts, as well as 300 bottles from small producers around the world. it also has more than 50 varieties of sour wild beers from countries including switzerland, italy and belgium, offering a flavor profile that can taste at times like sour candy. another spot spearheading the movement is milk bar (2424 east robinson street, orlando; 407-715-2138

Article 5 - the remote oregon town to try next
hours in any direction from the nearest decent-size city, wallowa county, ore., is remote even by the standards of the rural northwest. to get there, my husband, our daughter and i drove along the straw-colored cliffs of the columbia river, through pendleton, home of the sturdy woolen blanket, and la grande, a college town with a quiet core, before climbing onto dry high desert plateaus, winding along wild rivers, passing through pine forests and descending again into a valley of cattle and wheat. we were passing through far east oregon on a late-summer road trip between california and montana. the wallowa valley, at the tristate border with idaho and washington, was out of the way. but i’d heard about joseph — a town of just over 1,000 people with an outsize reputation for bronze sculptures and unrestrained natural beauty — from a photographer friend in portland. despite its remote location, the region had been attracting young portlanders, who brought the city’s design sensibility to tiny joseph, which is named for the nez percé chief who fought his tribe’s relocation from their ancestral home in the 1870s. photo until recently, the town’s biggest claim to fame — beyond its significant native american history — was a swiss-made tram that is said to have the steepest vertical lift for a four-passenger gondola in north america. but the wallowa valley is now also home to

the former has a better view and generally a better scene than the latter, where the service can be trying, and the food menu could be classified as “not-much-of-an-effort italian.” but neither is a place for foodies: they're for breezies, or whatever you call people who can easily suppress culinary criticism if their dinner or cocktail is served with a side of fresh air. the private park at the hudson hotel is also quite cool, a bustling scene off the elevated lobby where a new york crowd mixes with a few out-of-place hotel guests. the courtyard spot has a vague hint of alice in wonderland in that the décor is oversize: the ivy-covered a-frame trellis/roof, the colossal watering can with flowers creeping out of it and, alas, the line for the bar. things close down early (before midnight) for the benefit of the guest rooms that overlook the area, but the hotel has plenty of other bars to move into. for a scene that goes deeper into the night, try the park, the chelsea clubland standard whose name comes from its former incarnation as a parking garage but is also a nod to its tree-dotted garden. the cocktail list (and this is a cocktail place) ranges from standards like litchi martinis to a “caipirinha roja,” in which mango purée and merlot join the standard cachaça, sugar and lime combo.

Article 7 - loons and lager, ducks on draft: birders, brewers form flock
sabattus, maine (ap) — in the worlds of birders and craft beer lovers, there's a new paradigm, and it involves searching for ales along with the eagles, pairing stouts with swans and enjoying some bocks in tandem with buntings. tours and events aimed at attracting both beer nerds and bird enthusiasts are popping up all over the country, attracting bearded microbrew lovers, field-guide-wielding bird buffs and folks with a passion for both suds and sparrows. bird-and-beer happenings are taking place from los angeles to minneapolis to hampton, new hampshire. beer and bird hobbyists say they are united by their mutual love of minutiae, rarity and variety, whether searching for an indian peafowl or a limited release of india pale ale. typically, the trips begin with a hike and end at a brewery. one of the more successful tours is ""birds on tap roadtrip,"" located in beer-loving, bird-rich maine and now in its second year.

Article 8 - the capitalist cell
of course, the rapid-fire growth of the groups, as well as the magazine's own rise in circulation (this year's projection: 500,000, up from 100,000 just a few years ago), says much about the appeal of fast company's vision of ''democratic capitalism.'' the cells would seem the vanguard of that revolution, a spontaneous cult of fast company ideologues. ''the company of friends is the grateful dead of the new economy,'' says daniel pink, a fast company contributing editor. ''i'm expecting local cells to start selling bootleg tapes of their meetings to one another.'' but is all the excitement of the cells really about social change? or are they merely the new economy's version of the old-boy network, threatening at any moment to sink into self-parody? from the beginning, fast company billed itself as more movement than magazine, which probably helps explain why it -- and not wired, business 2.0 or the industry standard -- has been able to mobilize such a sizable off-page community of readers with comparatively little effort or money in such a short time. while most business magazines were busy charting the convulsions of the new economy in terms of mergers, pinstriped protagonists and economic indicators, the founders of fast company, alan weber and william taylor, understood that new technologies would create a new business culture, which would in turn require a new magazine. fast company billed itself as a ''workstyle

Article 10 - spirits of the south pole
why was the whisky found under the hut and not inside with the other rations? one theory is that shackleton himself put it there in the fall of 1908, before setting off for the pole, in anticipation of a victory celebration when he returned. but the fact that one case was found pried open, with a bottle missing, suggests that the whisky there may have been someone’s secret stash. wild, who was known to have a drinking problem, is a possible candidate. whisky lovers also like to imagine that the occasional bracing, restorative tot helped shackleton and his three companions — wild, eric marshall and jameson adams — withstand the hardship of their 1,700-mile trek south and back. on christmas day, we know, they celebrated with crème de menthe. it’s unlikely, though, especially on the return leg, when exhausted and malnourished and racing to get back before the nimrod left, that they would have wanted the burden of whisky bottles. what really got them through was cocaine — in the form of pills called forced march, which at one point marshall fed the group every hour or so. shackleton thought that the trip to the south pole and back would take about 90 days, but in the end he was gone for 122, most of them miserable. they left in late october, and by january it was clear that though they might reach the pole, it was very unlikely they would return

A Brewing Revolution: Craft Beer Trails and Beyond

In the United States, a new era of craft beer has emerged, with cities like New York and Orlando embracing the movement. The creation of brewery trails, such as New York's first trail, is a significant development in this industry.

New York's trail will feature over 20 breweries, offering a diverse range of beers from small producers. This growth is driven by younger drinkers who are seeking unique experiences. In contrast, traditional pubs like JBM Brew Lab in Brno, Czech Republic, offer a more laid-back atmosphere and an extensive beer list.

The craft beer scene has also inspired new events, such as the ""Birds on Tap Roadtrip"" tour, which combines birdwatching with beer tasting. This phenomenon is not unique to the United States, with similar tours taking place in Maine and other locations.

As the industry continues to grow, it's clear that there's more to craft beer than just a good pint. It's about community, exploration, and discovery – and the possibilities are endless.

Both articles discuss the challenges faced by the nonprofit sector, including declining donations and budget crises. However, the Reliable News Article provides more specific examples and data, such as the Connecticut Radio Information System's $50,000 deficit, which adds credibility to its claims.  The Reliable News Article also presents a balanced view of the issue, mentioning both the challenges faced by nonprofits and some organizations finding innovative ways to adapt and thrive. In contrast, the Fake News Article focuses on perceived problems with the nonprofit sector, such as inefficient use of funds and lack of business acumen, without providing concrete evidence or examples.  Overall, while there may be some minor discrepancies between the Reliable News Article and the given article, its overall tone and content are more in line with factual reporting.","Nonprofit Sector Faces Challenges Amid Growing Demand

The nonprofit sector, which has seen a surge in growth and demand for services, is facing significant challenges. With over 1.5 million organizations operating in the US alone, many are struggling to compete for limited resources.

One major issue is the lack of business acumen among some nonprofits, leading to inefficient use of funds. According to recent reports, a significant portion of donations go towards advertising and collecting donations, leaving little room for operational costs.

Meanwhile, welfare recipients are facing a different kind of challenge. With taxpayer subsidies providing a steady income, many have learned that they don't need to work, perpetuating a cycle of dependency.

In the private charity sector, experts warn that relying solely on donations is not enough to address national poverty and other social issues. ""The poor will always be with you,"" says one expert, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach.

Nonprofits are also facing cutthroat competition for scarce funds, leading to tensions between organizations advocating for different causes. The situation has become so dire that some experts are calling for greater collaboration and cooperation among nonprofits.

In addition, individuals affected by cancer are struggling with significant medical bills and financial burdens. A recent report highlights the need for more support and resources to help those navigating this challenging time.

As the nonprofit sector continues to grow and evolve, it's clear that addressing these challenges will require innovative solutions and a commitment to collaboration and cooperation.","Nonprofit Sector Faces Challenges Amid Economic Downturn

The nonprofit sector is facing unprecedented challenges as the economic downturn continues to impact fundraising efforts. Despite this, many organizations are finding ways to adapt and thrive.

According to recent data, total giving in the United States has grown every year since 1969, even during recessions. However, nonprofits are struggling to keep up with declining donations from companies and government grants.

One radio station for the blind is operating over budget and fears it will have to close by next summer due to a severe budget crisis. The Connecticut Radio Information System (CRIS) has seen a decline in funding from companies and government grants, leaving it with a $50,000 deficit.

In contrast, some organizations are finding innovative ways to raise funds. A new initiative by Bain, known as the Bridge Group, is providing strategic consulting services to nonprofits for a fee. This approach aims to complement the piecemeal, pro bono advice that many consultants have long provided.

Meanwhile, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has called for tax incentives and other measures to support nonprofit groups, which have faced government pressure in recent years. The country's tradition of philanthropy is limited, and the government has sought to establish more control over nonprofit organizations.

As nonprofits navigate these challenges, some are turning to creative solutions. A local initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is providing one-stop-shop simplicity for residents, businesses, and institutions to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, tax exemptions for charities face new challenges. The Senate Finance Committee has raised questions about whether some tax-exempt nonprofits have accumulated too much wealth, and legislators are considering imposing assessments on universities with endowments over $1 billion.

Despite these challenges, many nonprofits remain committed to their mission of providing public services and reducing government burdens.

Article 1 - why it takes a business brain to rule in the nonprofit space
why it takes a business brain to rule in the nonprofit space (before it's news) nonprofits are booming right now. in the us alone, there are something like 1.5 million organizations under that title. and the number is only continuing to grow. but at the moment, a good chunk of the nonprofit space is populated by those without business acumen. sure, they’ve got a lot of desire and the will to help people. but without business skills, it is difficult for nonprofits to succeed. remember, nonprofits still have to compete. it’s just that the competition takes a different form. in the business world, companies compete for profits. but in the nonprofit world, organizations compete for donor cash. and, no matter what you think, there’s only a limited supply of that. let’s take a look at some of the business skills that really help people rule in the nonprofit space. financially savvy ideas to get money to go further businesspeople tend to understand the value of things and money. and, as a result, they’re programmed, almost unconsciously, to maximize bang for the buck. at the moment, about 83 percent of the money charities receive goes back into the projects they do. another big chunk is spent on advertising and collecting donations. that leaves just a fraction left over to spend on the day to day running of the organization. thus, it’s super important to save money on operating costs wherever possible. so what can the average nonprofit do? one idea is

(before it's news) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_r_v9cybpy while millions of americans spend half their lives or more toiling for a paycheck, millions more are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the government to issue them their next monthly distribution. you’d think that emergency funds or government subsidization through programs like welfare would be used to help recipients purchase the things that they need to get by and help them get back on their feet so that they can find meaningful labor and contribute to society, but in a system without cross-checks and billions being dished out year-after-year, many have learned that they don’t need to work. and why should they? you’re doing the work for them in the form of taxpayer subsidies that are deducted from your earnings on a weekly basis. in america, those who work get punished. those who don’t, get a free ride, courtesy of a nationwide policy of spreading the wealth around through confiscation and redistribution. case in point: a welfare recipient in austin recently contacted a morning radio show and explained that she gets a lot of money from the program. what she does with it may (or may not) surprise you. here’s how your hard earned money is being used to help the less fortunate: more… source: http://

no more power, no more money. slush fund “charity” clinton global(ist) initiative laying off employees % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) from duran the clinton foundation has announced that it is laying off 22 staffers on the clinton global initiative. the round of layoffs is said to keep in line with earlier plans to deal with the negative effects placed on the foundation, due to hillary clinton’s presidential campaign. the clinton foundation, in a filing with the new york department of labor on thursday, said that the layoffs will take effect april 15, citing the discontinuation of the clinton global initiative. the real reason for the layoffs is simple. the clinton foundation has no more services to offer “donors” now that it has been locked out of government. since hillary’s election loss to trump, various state actors have cut back or completely stopped their donations towards the foundation. australia has cut its donations to $$0. norway cut its donations by 87%.

about doing more for my angels (before it's news) i have been told that i really need to discuss what i claim is from my angels and to publish as much as i can about both the experience and the theology of my angels. i only need to say that if indeed it is important to god for me to “get the message out there,” i will. i have to do it all within the context of god’s timing. the question then that most anyone would have for me, is how i would know when to do this. i can only say that i will just know. i don’t believe that right now is the time for me to do more for my angels than i am presently doing. i have told god that i will not make a penny from my angels. all i can say right now is that the articles and books have been written. but…and this is a big “but,” i don’t believe the time has yet come for me to do more for my angels than i am presently doing. in my thinking, i only have one shot at doing what i plan on doing for my angels. and if indeed i begin too soon, there will be a kind of “tiredness” in regard to what it is i do. it is my desire to keep the message as fresh as i can. if one were to visit my brother ralphie website, one will observe that i accept no money for advertising nor do i have any products i am selling.

Article 6 - private charity isn’t enough
private charity isn’t enough headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! “the idea that churches can tackle national poverty, take care of those who are ill, and rebuild communities after natural disasters requires a spoonful of bad moral theology and a cup of dishonesty.” – robert parham in a recent blog post, ethicsdaily.com editor and executive director of baptist center for ethics robert parham claimed that churches and charities could never do enough to alleviate poverty. i agree. poverty will never be “tackled” because it is a relative term; a moving target. if you could describe the plight of america’s poor today to a poor person in another country, or an american 100 years ago, they would conclude that poverty had been eliminated. the standard of living among the poorest americans today is incredible by world and historical standards. yet we still wage the war on poverty, even in america. this is not a bad thing – helping the down and out can be wonderful and is something christians are called to. but when we aim at targets like the “end” of poverty, there is no end to what we can justify in order to reach this impossible goal. “the poor will always be with you.” the question for christians is how best to reach them, spiritually and materially. the second reason i agree with parham’s claim is that, to the extent that poverty can be reduced, the church and private charity alone are simply too small to

non-profits at each other’s throats: feuding over scarce funds (before it's news) federal and state government officials aren’t the only ones sparring with each other over impending budget cuts: non-profit organizations are also getting into the ring. do-gooder organizations like the meals on wheels association of america, which are funded through a mix of public and private donations and government grants to provide services the government can’t or won’t, are contending with a shrinking pot of money from both sources. the funding crunch is making for ever-testier relations between nonprofit groups which advocate for different causes but compete for the same resources, which are all but sure to dwindle more as the federal government grapples with a $$1.3 trillion deficit. “this biggest problem facing the nonprofit business today is that we are all competing against each other like never before and it’s crazy,” meals on wheels’ ceo enid borden told the fiscal times. thoughts of how budget cuts could cost many vulnerable populations, including seniors, their livelihood keep borden up at night, but so does the idea that the nonprofit sector is becoming so cutthroat. “we are at war with ourselves, and we ought not to be…these are american problems we are all trying to address. why not sit down with likeminded nonprofits and devise better ways to do things together?” more

Article 8 - the costs of cancer
the costs of cancer (before it's news) so you get diagnosed with cancer and all of a sudden you put your entire life on hold and you grapple with side effects, hair loss, constant aches and pains, surgical recovery, and giant medical bills. you rob peter to pay paul so to speak every month as you juggle your bills. you take time off work to cope with treatment and you income tanks and money is even tighter. you try to save for retirement as you wonder if you will be there for retirement. but picture this if you were in college or just out and didn’t really have a job. you are dependent on your parents for money. you alternate between your dorm room, your parent’s sofa, and the infusion room. you try to figure out how you are ever going to have a career, if you are going to have a career. you hope you do not have to declare bankruptcy before 30 just to stay solvent because you have student loans and medical bills. at the same time you wonder if you will be around to turn 30. i have been in both situations. at 19, i was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, but was still on my parent’s health insurance and it took a summer to deal with the bulk of treatment, but have had follow up’s every year or more often since. medical bills and student loans were not as sky high back then but i did go through a lot of angst as a result of my diagnosis. then at

to the editor: re ''charities face needs of their own,'' nov. 23: while most nonprofits anticipate dismal fund-raising in this year's fourth quarter and beyond, according to the latest giving usa, since 1969 total giving in the united states has grown every year in current dollars, even during recessions (albeit more slowly). so there is money to be raised. the most important things nonprofits should do right now are: monitor their expenses and revenues weekly; assess donor bases to determine weak spots; attempt to distribute contributions over as large a number of donors as possible (should one large donor cease giving); emphasize good stewardship practices; get boards more involved in fund-raising than ever before; rethink or possibly reschedule special events; do all the groundwork for capital campaigns for when the economy improves; and try new strategies like joint fund-raising events with like-minded organizations. marian z. stern livingston, n.j., nov. 24, 2008 the author is a consultant to nonprofit organizations and an adjunct assistant professor at new york university in the george heyman jr. center for philanthropy and fundraising. readers are invited to submit letters to regionalmail@nytimes.com. letters are subject to editing. please include your name, address and contact information.

Article 2 - budget problems for a radio station helping the blind
a radio station for the blind is operating way over budget and fears it will have to close by next summer. the connecticut radio information system, or cris, is suffering from the worst budget crisis in its 25-year history, said james d. battaglio, a board member. cris can be accessed 24 hours a day through a special cable hookup, a specialty radio, the spanish language channel (sap) or on a toll-free phone number. the station broadcasts out of windsor and has satellite studios in trumbull, danbury norwich, and west haven. at the station, volunteers read printed material - primarily newspapers - over the air. there are four full-time employees and more than 400 volunteers. the service is free for the blind or those who can't easily read, as well as people with learning disabilities and mental handicaps. about 4,000 people used the service last year, said andrea pasquale, the executive director. advertisement continue reading the main story but in this fiscal year, which began july 1, the state granted the organization less than in the past and companies haven't given as much as usual. grants the private nonprofit station was expecting to get have also fallen through.

Article 3 - brandeis halts retirement payments
buffeted earlier this year by the outcry over its plans to raise money by closing its art museum and selling the collection, brandeis university said this week that it would suspend payments to the retirement accounts of faculty and staff members starting in july. while universities across the country have taken a wide range of actions to confront their financial problems, including layoffs and the suspension of capital projects, freezing contributions to retirement accounts is rare. financially troubled corporations have been taking such action, but faculty and staff members at colleges and universities have traditionally enjoyed stable, and generous, benefits — and expect no less. “there is this perception that the nonprofit world is maybe a gentler, kinder world than corporate,” said roland king, vice president for public affairs at the national association of independent colleges and universities. “so some people seem to perceive this as a breach of faith, especially since many people go into nonprofit work at less salary, because the benefits are so good. but we are absolutely at a point in this economy where these sort of things have to be on the table.” suspending brandeis’s contribution to retirement plans from july 1, 2009, through june 30, 2010, will cover $7.4 million of its projected $8.9 million deficit, the university’s president, jehuda reinharz, said in an e-mail message to the faculty and staff. in the message, mr. reinharz said he had planned to share

Article 4 - management; creating waves in nonprofit sea
but now, because of a project that was nine years in the making and that was officially started four weeks ago, such sophisticated advice forms the backbone of a new initiative by bain. the initiative, the bridge group, has close ties to bain but is a legally separate nonprofit organization. it has a staff of 12 of the best and brightest consultants from bain's ranks who have committed themselves to stints at bridge of six months to a year, even though they have to take pay cuts ranging from 80 percent for million-dollar-a-year bain executives to 20 percent for junior consultants. the bridge group is something entirely new in the world of big league business consulting -- a general-purpose strategic consulting firm that will help other nonprofit organizations for a fee. its aim is to complement the piecemeal, pro bono approach that bain and others have long taken toward helping nonprofits solve management and logistical woes. the group will offer the consistent, sustained advice that has helped big business wring more profit out of each invested dollar. it will also enhance the quality of help now provided by a plethora of nonprofit consultants, ranging from one-person shops to niche agencies, mostly focused on fund-raising or management. it is, bain consultants believe, a long overdue step. after all, the united states has about 770,000 nonprofits, not counting religious organizations, which last year took in an estimated $750 billion in fees, grants, donations and investment earnings. but despite accounting for

Article 5 - russian leader expresses support for nonprofits
moscow — president dmitri a. medvedev called monday for tax incentives and other measures to assist russia’s beleaguered nonprofit groups, which have come under government pressure in recent years. mr. medvedev, promoting policies that he hopes will modernize the country, said in a meeting with human rights advocates that new laws would not alleviate all the problems the groups faced, but that they would certainly help. “our main goal is the support of the authority of nonprofit groups in society, and the attraction to this sector of more talented people and philanthropic resources,” mr. medvedev said. “we need to stimulate philanthropy and create a stimulus or a motivation for volunteers who toil for such organizations.” the government has sought in recent years to establish more control over nonprofit groups, especially those that receive foreign assistance. mr. medvedev’s mentor, prime minister vladimir v. putin, the former president, has at times portrayed the groups as little more than tools that the west uses to meddle in russia’s affairs. photo under mr. putin, the groups were subjected to new regulations, as well as increased scrutiny that they have sometimes characterized as harassment. advertisement continue reading the main story charities and other nonprofit groups have also not prospered in russia because there is less of a tradition of giving here. in soviet times, the communist party was supposed to take care of societal needs, so a philanthropic sector barely existed.

Article 7 - tax exemptions of charities face new challenges
“we were shocked,” said michelle finholdt, who founded the center in 1994 and scraped together the money to buy a building in 2002. “there are a lot of other organizations in our area that we’re similar to, and they are exempt from property taxes.” the tax-exempt status of charities costs local governments $8 billion to $13 billion annually, according to various rough estimates. and local assessors are not the only government officials scratching their heads over which groups deserve privileged tax status. congress has threatened to impose a requirement that wealthy universities make minimum payouts from their endowments and raised questions about whether nonprofit hospitals are really all that different from their for-profit — and tax-paying — competitors. and, concerned about the way some churches are spending money, the senate finance committee has asked for detailed financial information from six evangelical ministries asking them to justify their tax exemptions. others are questioning whether some tax-exempt nonprofits, primarily universities and hospitals, have accumulated so much wealth that they should no longer be considered charities. in massachusetts, where harvard’s endowment has reached $35 billion in assets, legislators are weighing whether to impose a 2.5 percent annual assessment on universities with endowments of more than $1 billion. the idea behind tax exemptions is that the organizations provide a public service or substantially reduce the burdens of government. standards from property-tax exemptions are set by the states, while the federal exemption means charities are not taxed on their income. almost

“at some point, it all becomes static,” said adam jones, americans for prosperity’s nevada director, spreading a messy stack of glossy campaign mailers across his desk. the senate race in nevada is among a handful of contests that could determine control of congress. conservative and liberal organizations — many backed by well-known, deep-pocketed benefactors like the kochs, tom steyer and george soros — have already sunk more than $54 million into the nevada race, according to the center for responsive politics. more than 85 percent of nevada voters live in the las vegas area, a sprawling city still recovering from the 2008 housing crisis that has left a transient population. voter rolls, particularly for latinos, who could make up 20 percent of the state’s voters, have been rendered relatively unreliable. that has not stopped the legions of canvassers, who this weekend will begin urging voters to cast their ballots early at trailers in the parking lot of their local home depot or albertsons, among other locations. much of the attention is focused on the senate race. republicans are hoping that representative joe heck will win the seat held by senator harry reid, the retiring democratic leader. but mr. reid fervently wants democrats to keep the seat he has held for 30 years and strongly supports catherine cortez masto, a former nevada attorney general. photo there are some signs that

Article 9 - philanthropists start requiring management courses to keep nonprofits productive
the omidyar network, through which mr. omidyar supports both commercial and nonprofit ventures, found that charities set goals that often did not match their employees’ skill sets, lacked succession planning and were led by executives stretched too thin. in 2006, mr. lewis set up a nonprofit called the management center to provide human resources and other consulting services to groups to which he and others donated. he has tangled with prominent organizations like case western reserve university and the guggenheim museum over what he considers bad management, but he said he had intended the management center to work primarily with the fledgling progressive groups he was underwriting then. “they weren’t so interested, so i finally had to say, ‘i won’t give you any more money until you learn this stuff,’ ” mr. lewis said. “i don’t have that kind of leverage with the guggenheim and those big organizations.” nonprofit leaders are notoriously prickly about allowing major donors to get involved in how they manage their organizations, but officials of groups that have used the services provided by mr. lewis and mr. omidyar say they were enormously beneficial. “many donors say they provide value beyond financial resources, but in reality that’s quite rare,” said tim hanstad, chief executive of landesa, which works to ensure land rights to the rural poor. “but frankly, i could easily make the case that the nonfinancial resources we got from omidyar were as equally beneficial as

Content: the profit motive is intrinsic to american life, but we have seen how greed and stupidity can make it run amok. at a time like this, the not-for-profit model looks a lot more sensible. maybe some of these enterprises will serve as a kind of economic balm as for-profit excesses play out painfully in the marketplace. photo amid legions of layoffs, it is comforting to consider that nonprofit companies — including hospitals, clinics and civic organizations — are a robust source of employment. another nonprofit sector, education, is likely to flourish now as the newly unemployed seek temporary shelter from the economic storm. the jobs in these areas usually pay less than their for-profit equivalents, but these days the for-profit equivalents may not even exist anymore. nonprofit businesses are hardly immune to economic motives and realities — and to layoffs, for that matter — but if they are out of the direct line of fire, they are likely to provide pockets of hope in a dismal economic picture.

Nonprofit Sector Faces Challenges Amid Economic Downturn

The nonprofit sector is facing unprecedented challenges as the economic downturn continues to impact fundraising efforts. Despite this, many organizations are finding ways to adapt and thrive.

According to recent data, total giving in the United States has grown every year since 1969, even during recessions. However, nonprofits are struggling to keep up with declining donations from companies and government grants.

One radio station for the blind is operating over budget and fears it will have to close by next summer due to a severe budget crisis. The Connecticut Radio Information System (CRIS) has seen a decline in funding from companies and government grants, leaving it with a $50,000 deficit.

In contrast, some organizations are finding innovative ways to raise funds. A new initiative by Bain, known as the Bridge Group, is providing strategic consulting services to nonprofits for a fee. This approach aims to complement the piecemeal, pro bono advice that many consultants have long provided.

Meanwhile, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has called for tax incentives and other measures to support nonprofit groups, which have faced government pressure in recent years. The country's tradition of philanthropy is limited, and the government has sought to establish more control over nonprofit organizations.

As nonprofits navigate these challenges, some are turning to creative solutions. A local initiative in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is providing one-stop-shop simplicity for residents, businesses, and institutions to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Nonprofit Sector Faces Challenges Amid Growing Demand

The nonprofit sector, which has seen a surge in growth and demand for services, is facing significant challenges. With over 1.5 million organizations operating in the US alone, many are struggling to compete for limited resources.

One major issue is the lack of business acumen among some nonprofits, leading to inefficient use of funds. According to recent reports, a significant portion of donations go towards advertising and collecting donations, leaving little room for operational costs.

Meanwhile, welfare recipients are facing a different kind of challenge. With taxpayer subsidies providing a steady income, many have learned that they don't need to work, perpetuating a cycle of dependency.

In the private charity sector, experts warn that relying solely on donations is not enough to address national poverty and other social issues. ""The poor will always be with you,"" says one expert, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach.

Nonprofits are also facing cutthroat competition for scarce funds, leading to tensions between organizations advocating for different causes. The situation has become so dire that some experts are calling for greater collaboration and cooperation among nonprofits.

In addition, individuals affected by cancer are struggling with significant medical bills and financial burdens. A recent report highlights the need for more support and resources to help those navigating this challenging time.

As the nonprofit sector continues to grow and evolve, it's clear that addressing these challenges will require innovative solutions and a commitment to collaboration and cooperation.

The San Diego Chargers are facing an uncertain future after a recent ballot measure to fund a new stadium failed. The team's owner, Dean Spanos, has notified the NFL and several team owners that he plans to relocate the team to Los Angeles.

This decision comes after years of attempts to secure funding for a new stadium in San Diego. Despite efforts by local officials and business leaders, the proposal was ultimately rejected by voters. The Chargers had teamed up with the Oakland Raiders to make a bid to move to the Los Angeles area, but were rebuffed.

The team's struggles on the field have also contributed to their decision. After two losses in as many games, Chargers coach Eric Mangini acknowledged that the team is ""close"" to being 2-0, highlighting the small margin between winning and losing in the NFL.

While some speculate that a majority vote may not be enough to keep the Chargers in San Diego, team owner Dean Spanos has expressed confidence in his decision. The deadline for relocation to Los Angeles is January 15, giving the team time to finalize plans.

The move would mark the second major relocation of an NFL team in recent years, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles from St. Louis.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

miami dolphins 2012 nfl draft rumors: did owner stephen ross tip draft strategy in phone call? (before it's news) by bob evans senior writer things haven’t been going according to plan for miami dolphins’ fans this offseason. after expecting their team to make some sort of splash in free agency—either for a quarterback or another big-name player—fans have instead had to watch their no. 1 receiver traded away for two third-round picks, and every one of their free agency desires sign elsewhere. while the majority of the fan base grows restless over the recent inactivity of the team, dolphins owner stephen ross is attempting to calm their concerns—one season-ticket holder at a time. in a recent phone call with jason lawrence, a long-time season ticket holder, ross discussed some of the moves/non-moves he and general manager jeff ireland are being called out by the fans for. during this phone call, ross stated the team never had a desire to sign/pay new seattle seahawks quarterback matt flynn $$8 million a year, and that the team was going to cut brandon marshall if they did not receive a trade offer. while both of these are interesting items from the phone conversation, it is what he said while talking about flynn that may have tipped the team’s draft strategy. ross said, “if my coach said, ‘i want matt flynn as our starting quarterback next year,’ he

after the meeting, according to the person with knowledge of the matter, spanos notified commissioner roger goodell and several team owners that he would be moving the chargers to los angeles, something that had appeared all but inevitable since november, when voters in san diego shot down a proposal to use hotel taxes to help the team build a new stadium. an n.f.l. spokesman declined to comment. a chargers spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the chargers for years were unable to forge a deal with a succession of mayors to build a jointly financed replacement for qualcomm stadium, one of the oldest stadiums in the league. the city also lacked the concentration of big corporations that the league and teams often consider critical to supporting a team. the chargers’ decision to leave comes almost exactly a year after the team owners decided to allow the rams to leave st. louis and return to los angeles. the chargers, who had teamed up with the oakland raiders to make a separate bid to move to the los angeles area, were rebuffed. but the chargers were given one year to decide whether they wanted to move in with the rams in inglewood. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's

Title: what the lopsided chargers stadium-vote loss means for nfl relocation in l.a., las vegas
Content: chairman dean spanos will have to figure out what’s next for the chargers. (pat sullivan/ap photo) a resounding defeat tuesday of a stadium-financing measure by voters in san diego has those within the nfl wondering if the chargers will exercise their option to join the rams in los angeles. it had been widely expected that measure c would fail to achieve the two-thirds supermajority needed for approval. but after the ballot initiative fell significantly short of reaching even a simple majority, confidence within the league appears to have dimmed that any ongoing attempt by the chargers to make things work in san diego would be successful. “you’d have to think this brings l.a. back into the picture,” one person familiar with the league’s inner workings said wednesday morning. “that wasn’t even close. is there a future from them there [in san diego]? dean [spanos, the chairman of the chargers] will have to figure out what he wants to do. i’m sure that will take a little time.” [ the chargers’ stadium vote failed miserably ] the ballot measure reportedly was being supported by about 43 percent of voters, with not all ballots yet counted. it would have raised $1.15 billion in public funding, via an increase in the hotel tax, for a stadium estimated to cost around $1.8 billion. spanos, in a letter to fans , said it was unclear at this point what the franchise’s next move will be. “in terms of what comes next for the chargers, it’s just too early to give you an answer,” spanos wrote. “we are going to diligently explore and weigh our options, and do what is needed to maintain our options, but no decision will be announced until after the football season concludes and no decision will be made in haste.” the chargers have until jan. 15 to exercise their option to join the rams in los angeles. the rams moved from st. louis to l.a. for this season and are playing at the los angeles memorial coliseum while their new stadium in inglewood is under construction. the option to join the rams in l.a. would pass to the oakland raiders if the chargers decline it. however, raiders owner mark davis has said he intends to move his franchise to las vegas. the raiders’ relocation would have to be ratified by at least 24 of the 32 nfl owners. the team can apply after the season for relocation. so there will be much for the owners to contemplate in the coming offseason. [ nfl owners’ approval of a raiders’ move to las vegas would not be automatic ] “there are some moving parts to this,” the person with knowledge of the situation said. there is also the possibility that the chargers could postpone a decision on l.a. the los angeles option given to them by the nfl owners contains a

San Diego Chargers on Brink of Relocation

The San Diego Chargers are facing an uncertain future after a recent ballot measure to fund a new stadium failed. The team's owner, Dean Spanos, has notified the NFL and several team owners that he plans to relocate the team to Los Angeles.

This decision comes after years of attempts to secure funding for a new stadium in San Diego. Despite efforts by local officials and business leaders, the proposal was ultimately rejected by voters. The Chargers had teamed up with the Oakland Raiders to make a bid to move to the Los Angeles area, but were rebuffed.

The team's struggles on the field have also contributed to their decision. After two losses in as many games, Chargers coach Eric Mangini acknowledged that the team is ""close"" to being 2-0, highlighting the small margin between winning and losing in the NFL.

While some speculate that a majority vote may not be enough to keep the Chargers in San Diego, team owner Dean Spanos has expressed confidence in his decision. The deadline for relocation to Los Angeles is January 15, giving the team time to finalize plans.

The move would mark the second major relocation of an NFL team in recent years, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles from St. Louis.

The article's content is focused on the author's negative experience with the restaurant, specifically the waiter's behavior and the chef's attitude.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Exploring the Uncharted: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Adventure"" has no connection to the original article's topic or style. It appears to be a generic travelogue about exploring America's diverse landscapes and discussing personal growth and change.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE ""A City's Evolution: From Nightlife to Family-Friendly Resorts"" is more similar in style and content to the original article, as it also discusses a specific dining experience at a restaurant (Peter Luger's) in New York City. However, its focus on the evolution of Albany's nightlife and the shift towards family-friendly resorts makes it less relevant to the original article.  Given these similarities and differences, I am more confident that the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is the most similar to the original article.","""Exploring the Uncharted: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Adventure""

As I embarked on a cross-country road trip, I found myself immersed in the beauty of America's diverse landscapes. From the quaint town of Cambridge, Maryland, to the bustling streets of New York City, each stop revealed a unique aspect of this great nation.

During my visit to New York City, I had the opportunity to reflect on the importance of personal growth and change. A conversation with a friend about the nature of people's potential for transformation sparked a thought-provoking discussion about the human condition.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, individuals were embracing their passions and exploring new horizons. A group of friends gathered for a potluck party, sharing classic American dishes and laughter, while another family embarked on a road trip to South Carolina and Georgia, enjoying the scenic beauty of Savannah.

In the midst of these adventures, I also discovered the joy of simple pleasures – like reading and ice cream evenings with loved ones. A father's initiative to create a special bonding experience for his children brought smiles to their faces and created lasting memories.

As I continued on my journey, I encountered individuals who were redefining what it means to live a fulfilling life. Preppers and survivalists had shed their old identities and adopted a new approach, one that prioritized self-sufficiency and community building.

Through these encounters, I realized that the true essence of America lies not in its grandeur or iconic landmarks but in the everyday moments of connection, growth, and joy that make life worth living.","A City's Evolution: From Nightlife to Family-Friendly Resorts

Albany, once known for its vibrant nightlife, has undergone a significant transformation. The city's lawmakers, who would often gather at bars and restaurants near the capitol, began to shift their habits in the 1990s as politics became more partisan. This change led to accusations of harassment and assault, resulting in stricter rules and a less fraternizing atmosphere.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, cities like New York are experiencing a resurgence in fine dining. Restaurants like Peter Luger's and Keens have become popular destinations, offering a unique blend of traditional cuisine with modern touches. These establishments have become hubs for locals and visitors alike, showcasing the city's rich culinary scene.

In contrast, some families are seeking out more relaxed and family-friendly environments. A resort in upstate New York has become a haven for parents and children, offering activities like swimming, fishing, and scavenger hunts. The resort's focus on providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all ages has made it a popular destination for families.

As cities continue to evolve, it's clear that the needs of their residents are changing. From nightlife to family-friendly resorts, New York is proving that there's something for everyone. Whether you're looking for fine dining or a relaxing getaway, the city has something to offer.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - road trip u.s.a. – days 16 – 21
road trip u.s.a. – days 16 – 21 (before it's news) day sixteen we departed early in the morning and drove to norfolk, virginia. we crossed over the chesapeake bay bridge/tunnel (blog post here). we stopped for the day in cambridge, maryland. a very quaint town, just a pity the weather was a bit overcast. but the weather did not stop us walking to the high spot for a couple of beers before heading to jimmie and sook’s for dinner. dinner was good. laura had crab, i had steak and oysters. day seventeen now close to our final goal of new york city, we took it easy. we paid a visit to st. michael, another quaint little village. i had planned to visit the winery there, but it did not open until 12noon. it was not a wasted journey, because we popped into the ? and picked up ? the weather was not getting any better so we decided to carry on to annapolis, which was our base for the night. a charming city even in the drab weather. famished we had lunch at mcgravey’s oyster bar and saloon. we both ordered the same, a seafood club sandwich type thing, i can’t remember exactly, but it was a brioche roll with prawns, crab etc. after lunch we had a quick look round the harbour, and a little more sightseeing before checked

24 hours in new york city % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) a story about a band of brothers recently i was driving around town listening to the beatles channel on sirius/xm radio. it’s a great channel for fab four fans like me, but every now and then they will play a cover of a beatles song that makes me want to puncture my ear drums with a skewer. it’s right about then that i switch over to 105.7 the fan. on this particular occasion, 10am-2pm talking head vinny cerrato discussed troubled players with poor work ethics. i thought of that skewer again. cerrato summarily dismissed all such players, and insinuated that they are who they are and they aren’t capable of change. to put a bow on his argument, cerrato went metaphorical on his listeners concluding, “a leopard can’t change his spots.” that may be true of a leopard, but i detest the notion that people can’t change. it undermines the greatest of innate human qualities. sometimes they just need to be enabled by the right people, with proper guidance. you only need to want to change. let that resonate for a moment… two weekends ago i journeyed up to new york city to visit an old high school friend with a couple of high school buddies, joe stumbroski and craig wehr. we all spent our form

(before it's news) it was the first time my kind-hearted boss shook his head in disappointment at me in front of everyone. the embarrassment and shame when he said i had forgotten where i came from. i felt all eyes on me, in disbelief, as if i had done something beyond terrible. as blood rushed to turn my face red, i wanted to just close my eyes and magically disappear from the room. huh?” when asked about how my mid-autumn festival was spent earlier this week. i had forgotten all about it despite seeing all my foodie friends eating/baking mooncakes since last week. actually, i didn’t forget but just my brain does not function at its normal capacity on days when i do not have breakfast – which was the case for that fateful day. so what crime did i commit? well, one early morning, i groggily responded with a confused “” when asked about how mywas spent earlier this week.i had forgotten all about it despite seeing all my foodie friends eating/baking mooncakes since last week. actually, i didn’t forget but just my brain does not function at its normal capacity on days when i do not have breakfast – which was the case for that fateful day. so i’ve learnt my lesson and the next morning, i made sure i woke up early for a hearty meal before leaving the house. creamy avocado egg salad. for

Article 4 - the new renaissance
the new renaissance (before it's news) we have been preppers/survivalist for a very long time. so long, in fact, that we no longer think of ourselves in terms of being preppers or surivalists. instead, over the years we have shed our former lives and embraced a new renaissance. we don’t garden for the sake of preparedness, but for the sake of a better lifestyle. we don’t make cheese, preserve food, hunt or keep bees so that we can survive the end of the world – what fun would that be? we do all of those things so that we can live a more fulfilling life today. twenty-five years ago, sir knight and i were a typical suburban family (well, perhaps not typical, but close anyway). we window shopped in crowded shopping malls, ate late breakfasts at trendy, upscale restaurants and hiked on the weekends because it was part of the pacific northwest lifestyle. we ate out three days a week, paid other people to care for our daughter and spent more time in traffic than we did at home. ours was a “normal” middle class existence. we didn’t think farther ahead than what we would eat for dinner and we actually thought that the model of vehicle we drove was important. and then we had a huge seattle-style wind storm, complete with pouring rain (what else was new), lightening (hitting the man-hole cover in front of our house) and a plugged gutter

workin’ weekend % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! this weekend was our project weekend. you know the ones….you’ve gotta get caught up on all the things that you’ve been kinda slacking on? yep… one of those. caleb and i were so ready for the weekend! he always asks if it’s a “you and me” day (my off day from work). i had some requests last week about those jalapeno hamburgers. they were soooo fabulous! they weren’t overly spicy once they were cooked, just had really good flavor. we literally just added a few spoonfulls of diced jalapenos to our hamburger meat before making them into patties. just kinda eyeball it and adjust to how you like it. friday night we visited with caleb’s great-grandpa. they enjoy each other’s company so much. it’s really sweet when they spend one on one time together. caleb discovered his love of marking his mama with highlighters. the only problem? i’m literally one handed right now after surgery and i couldn’t steal it away or stop him very well. he obviously thought this was hilarious… i’ve been working on toning and only have 11 pounds to go until goal weight! so stinkin’ excited! one of my problem areas is my tummy after having the c-section. it is finally starting

Article 6 - family trip with kid to south carolina and georgia – part 2
family trip with kid to south carolina and georgia – part 2 % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) family combo trip with flight and road trip savannah in savannah, we stayed at kimpton hotel. it is an eclectic yet pleasant hotel with modern decor with antique overlays. when we got there, there was a surprise waiting for us in the room: champagne bottle and cake to celebrate our anniversary. the is no on-site parking at the hotel, but it does have a fun and interesting valet/concierge. in morning we returned the car. quite an unpleasant experience with enterprise. their training program works too well, they become drones of the company treating customers as just numbers and nothing else. went to forsyth park walked around the victorian district with victorian style houses. walked back up parallel to the park through many different squares. which broke up the walk nicely with some great and much need shades and greenery. made our way past the synagogue and then the cathedral. and then had an awesome cooldown break at leopold’s ice cream parlor where we had chocolate ice cream, cream and chew ice cream, and a freshly squeezed fruit fizzy. there we hopped on for a carriage ride through the town. it ended up being a private tour as there was no one else for the ride at the time. next stop was the bee company. we sampled a whole lot of honey and played with

Article 7 - that special date
that special date (before it's news) last night in bed, my husband and i discussed what we should do for our anniversary. culture tells us that anniv celebrations are big stuff. gotta keep the flame alive! be playful! take a break from routine! say nice things! have heart-to-heart conversation! reminisce! dream! hold hands! so, “what about going out to eat?” i suggested. but eating in public—doing anything in public, really—brings out the awkward in my husband, and it’s not fun to spend money on someone else’s cooking while feeling awkward. next suggestion: we could see a movie? but then we’d have to arrange child care. and get there. and spend a couple hours sitting in the dark smelling chemical-drenched popcorn and staring at a crazy-huge flickering screen. so nah. him: did you buy me a gift? me: no. did you buy me a gift? him: no. we laughed at our pathetically predictable selves, said goodnight, and flipped away from each other into our respective sleep positions—me: face-down to the left; him: face-down to the right. this morning we ran the loop together. which was actually a perfect anniversary-type activity since we first got to know each other during sweaty, early-morning runs through various san antonio missions. this morning—eighteen years, four children, and many adventures later—our younger son was up and begging to come

Article 8 - feeding our people
feeding our people (before it's news) short version: we’re inviting people across the country to have potluck parties in honor of american classics reinvented, to gather the people you love together to share food everyone can have together. have a pie party. a midwest celebration! a long southern afternoon of eating hush puppies and gumbo with your friends and family. read on for more details. years ago now, my friend sharon, our roommate william, and her boyfriend ed rented a car, negotiated the streets of midtown new york, made it to the 9w up the west side of manhattan, and drove up to the catskills for the weekend. there were snacks in the car — every good road trip needs snacks — and much laughter. sharon is the single funniest person i’ve ever known, and i’ve known her for 33 years now. william still makes me laugh after only 2 minutes on the phone. and ed’s full name is ed helms. this was in the year 2000, before the office or anything after it. in fact, i sat in the audience with about 8 other people at the open mic where all three of my friends did their first-ever stand-up routines. (i’ve always been better at the supportive laughing part than the performing part.) so with a car full of three hilarious people and one laughing while driving, this was a good trip. we stayed at a strange little bed and breakfast

Article 9 - reading and ice cream evenings
reading and ice cream evenings (before it's news) about a month ago i got this email from my father: sometimes i find material which i think the four kids would enjoy, but waiting for the spontaneous moment to read to them has proven elusive. therefore, i propose a “reading and ice cream evening out.” the setup could go something like this: parent(s) bring progeny about 7:00 then may go on home or stay. i read for up to 60 minutes, during which time shirley serves ice cream, followed by discussion/lounging for another 10 to 15 minutes. unless parent(s) has stayed, i drive the kids home about 8:30. of course i said yes. i’d have been a fool not to. and now thursday evenings are reserved for stories and ice cream with the grands. so far they have read “nature man” from cruise of the snark by jack london, ransom of red chief by o’henry, to build a fire by jack london (out by the fire pit, naturally), a boy named sue, by shel silverstein, and “wully, the story of a yaller dog” from wild animals i have known by ernest thompson seton. last thursday when i dropped them off, i lingered. the kids immediately made a beeline for their seats (all except for my younger daughter who made a stop by the fridge, to check out the ice cream

Article 10 - saturday’s top 5 laughs
(before it's news) so i have been going nuts all week trying to find five funny things to post today…i have not had the most amusing week at all. my son had another bullying issue and we had to involve the principal and the school resource officer aka county police officer this time. this has consumed a lot of my time and energy this week. the thing that irks me is that this is one of the same kids who has been terrorizing my son for years. come to find out, both of the kid’s parents are correctional officers. but they can’t correct their own kid? what?! then my anniversary was thursday and the day was completely ruined. my hubby surprised me by taking the day off. i woke up and he had scrubbed the kitchen from top to bottom. then our phone, internet, and cable went out due to a local outage and remained out for almost 24 hours. (i hate you, fios!) this wouldn’t have mattered except for the fact that without a working phone, we couldn’t find a sitter. we also couldn’t order take-out because again, no phone, and no internet to view menus. i got stuck with taco bell and a lot of apologies. fun times. anyway, here’s my lame attempt at 5 cute or funny things this week. when you’re done here, click the cute little picture at the head of the post to read other submissions or add your own! happy easter, everyone

Article 1 - a breather for parents and kids
to my astonishment, the food was divine. i would have gladly eaten spaghettio's as long as i could consume them peacefully, and yet here we were being offered a choice of prime rib au jus with a reduction demiglaze, or grilled salmon, roasted fingerling potatoes, pencil-thin asparagus, and a glorious tossed salad with baby spinach. and there were two kinds of pie, chocolate cake and ben & jerry's ice cream -- all served buffet style in a spacious dining room with candles and a vase of fresh flowers on every table. although many guests had either renewed or struck up friendships during the cocktail party and ate together, ken and i requested a table for two. there we sat, a bottle of chardonnay between us, blinking wordlessly across a white linen tablecloth, praying the beeper wouldn't go off. it didn't. even the fact that both children shrieked through most of that night, undoubtedly disturbing the residents of ferncroft a through d, did not dissipate the wondrous first impression the tyler place had made on us. and it's an impression that hasn't really changed, although our daughters are now 5 and 7 and wear backpacks to their programs (this year they were in senior midgets and juniors respectively). instead of parent helpers they have counselors, who take them swimming in the resort's two pools, fishing in the lake or on scavenger hunts in the woods. or the

Article 2 - what does this city need? o.k., you asked
hardly anyone talks that way now, and mr. garvin is the public face on the new, more ambitious view. he made his name in part with his 1996 book, ''the american city,'' which lays out in 477 weighty pages his critique of how dozens of cities have succeeded, but more often failed, to plan their futures. a central argument of mr. garvin's book is that every urban planning project must start a market reaction -- a business response outside of the site itself -- or it is doomed to failure. thinking about ground zero, by that measure, means thinking about everything from the street grid of lower manhattan to mass transit's connections out into the suburbs and the restaurants of broad street. and his cornerstone thought, mr. garvin said, is to think big. his inspiration is the early 20th century planner, daniel burnham, who laid out much of chicago and lived by the dictum that small ideas always fail. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters.

Article 3 - in albany, life has seeped out of night life
but albany was never known for its coffee shops. lawmakers once flocked to the bars and restaurants near the capitol for dinner, or drinks, or tomfoolery. occasionally, they would meet for all three, and some still do. in april, an assemblyman was charged with drunken driving and speeding after, according to the albany police, he was caught driving 65 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone. but most tales of the old days never made the papers. the young woman who plucked the spectacles off a bookish assemblyman and said he could stay the night at her place if he could find his way there without them. the sumptuous dinners with a colleague from across the aisle or across the state. the booze. the late nights. the booze. those habits began to die out in the 1990s, many lawmakers say, when politics became more partisan. the nonpartisan hangouts downtown, like the plaza grill a few blocks from the capitol, were replaced by new spots where people gathered with their own political kind. but more significant, all agree, were the accusations of harassment and even assault made by staff members or interns, mostly younger and female, against older, more powerful men. they culminated in the 2004 conviction of a senior aide to assembly speaker sheldon silver for sexual misconduct. stringent new rules enjoining lawmakers from fraternizing with interns followed, and with them came a far less

Article 4 - paid notice: deaths brody, jerome
brody-jerome. successful businessman, restaurateur, thoroughbred horse breeder & owner, political activist and devoted husband and father, died yesterday in miami, florida at the age of 78. mr. brody is perhaps best known for his successful restaurants, gallagher's steak house and the grand central oyster bar. however, he was equally successful as a breeder of thoroughbred race horses and champion angus cattle. he was also very active in politics, supporting and working for john f. kennedy, edward i. koch, and mario m. cuomo, among others. mr. brody developed restaurant associates from a loose string of coffee houses into a powerful and profitable business. he conceived and initiated the movement to create high quality destination restaurants in new york city, beginning with the development of the four seasons. with architect philip johnson, brody also transformed the rainbow room, atop the then rca building, from a failing eatery into a world-class restaurant and night spot. one of mr. brody's greatest insights was the intersection between the public and private sectors. he turned restaurant associates around by recognizing the need for quality food service at public locations. he worked with the port authority and the new york thruway authority to meet their needs and requirments, providing a quality service to the traveling pubic and also making a profit. the grand central oyster bar became a success because brody understood the limitations and opportunity of a

Article 5 - the great escape, at vintage tables
the city has dozens of restaurants with an extended back story. there's bayard's, just blocks from the smoldering world trade center wreckage, where you can't help feeling a chill on being reminded that the building was erected 150 years ago. there's delmonico's, from 1835, and p. j. clarke's, from 1904, and peter luger, from 1887. and every one of them looks more valuable today, when the city seems so vulnerable. the five i ate in during the last week are not musty old relics serving tired food in smoke-scarred rooms. for the most part, they wear their decades proudly. the service staffs generally have a tag-team smoothness that is rare in so many restaurants where service is a way station, not a profession. the chefs know how to dress a salad, not with some austere drizzle but with rich, creamy vinaigrettes, almost thick enough to stand a spoon in. these are places that could pass for theme restaurants, but they cater to new yorkers. no wonder all of them are bustling. some of them, like peter luger, studiously ignore every trend of the last 30 or 40 years. others, like keens, blend just enough up-to-date touches into the menu to make it seem almost sprightly. but most are like the oyster bar, where the pepper on the counter is ground mccormick but

Article 6 - hooked on a single place
these women are not dispossessed natives or roots-seekers; none has ethnic ties to the country of her obsession, though such connections drive many travelers. they all seem to have caught their passion by intellectual accident: a book, a course, a trip taken at a moment of vulnerability or openness. i know the feeling. i spent a bone-chilling march week hitchhiking around ireland in 1971, and somewhere between negotiating the dark confusion of pre-celtic tiger dublin and biking along the serene lakes of killarney, i got hooked. though i love many places and make it a point to travel to new ones, i live and breathe ireland and mark my life by which trip i'm planning or remembering. in 2001, i had a very happy year because between business and pleasure, i went to ireland four times for a spirits-lifting total of seven weeks. on my last trip, the usually dour immigration officer at dublin airport said ''hello again'' with a grin as he leafed through my passport in search of a page not already stamped ireland. last summer, breaking a five-year tradition, i tried to go cold turkey and passed on an august trip, but nothing in my life seemed quite right until i broke down and booked a flight to shannon departing aug. 2. familiarity amid strangeness casts an addicting spell. it feels good to be known and to know your way around, especially in a place where

Article 7 - keeping it kosher
he left after perhaps seven minutes. her agitation lasted longer than that, as she questioned what right and what cause he had to imply that the couples at the bar, who had behaved unremarkably and kept to themselves, were somehow morally wanting. “what’s godly about that?” she said. “it’s not nice.” perez, who is roman catholic, was at this point talking with the restaurant’s sous chef, adam sanogueira, who is an observant jew but not hasidic. he watched the whole scene from the restaurant’s kitchen, which is open to the dining room. and he, too, was displeased by the rabbi’s behavior. “it’s embarrassing,” he said in an angry voice. “it feeds the notion that orthodox jews want to control and repress.” he shook his head, lowered his eyes and fell silent for a while. both perez and sanogueira seemed more disturbed — and sadder — than people dealing with a workplace annoyance typically would be. but i had come to know them well enough, and had spent enough time in and around basil, to understand why. for them and for so many others who work there daily or eat there frequently, it isn’t just a restaurant. it’s also a cross-cultural experiment, trying to promote better integration of, and communication between, groups in crown heights that haven’t always mingled much or seen eye to eye. although its food and wine are strictly kosher, basil isn

Article 8 - so who’s the help?
not too college-coy i am going through the college-selection process (a k a looking at too many schools to remember). but when friends and their parents ask which schools i am interested in, i feel as if they’re fishing for my sat scores. how do i respond to their questions, but keep my grades to myself? arielle schacter, new york city let’s assume you are correct, though i suspect your classmates already have a sense of your place in the pecking order. and we older folks are so exquisitely aware of how much harder it is to get into college these days that we’re too busy being grateful for our diplomas to worry much about your scores. photo since you made the grand tour, why not offer a range of schools to people who ask which ones you like — from the tippity-top of your “reach” list to the lowest you’d stoop. (harvard, maybe?) no sense being too coy, though. you are going to end up at a college eventually, and folks will find out. and though i would have kicked the person who had suggested as much to me at your age, try not to worry: it all works out in the end. really. try the home brew i am a reasonably successful woman in my late 30s. i have a nice boyfriend (my first in many years), and we’ve settled into a pleasant-enough domestic routine. so why do i want to run off

Article 9 - ‘american pie’ still homemade, but with a new twist
in the 1960s, mr. mclean regularly performed at caffè lena, which nurtured the early careers of folk artists like bob dylan and arlo guthrie. photo this much is true. the rest of the story holds that one evening in 1970, after a late performance at the cafe, mr. mclean retired to the tin & lint and set to work writing “american pie.” in some versions, it was in a notebook; in others, on bar napkins. all end with mr. mclean’s leaving the notes behind. jim stanley, the tin & lint’s current owner, was the bar’s doorman in 1970. mr. stanley, 63, said he believed that another employee, a skidmore college student known as sloth, grabbed the notes and followed mr. mclean to the street to return them. “i agree — he didn’t write it all here,” mr. stanley said. “but i do believe he started it here and maybe finished it someplace else.” mr. mclean has heard the saratoga story for years, and while he has tried to correct it — he said he wrote the song in cold spring, n.y., and in philadelphia — people hang on to their version. on monday night, patrons at the tin & lint insisted that the beginnings lay at the booth across the room. mr. mclean said the stories did not bother him.

Article 10 - gingrich is soldiering on, despite dearth of victories
“i have no incentive to get out of the race,” mr. gingrich said before finishing a distant third in louisiana, with 16 percent of the vote, despite campaigning there most of last week. “i have every incentive to talk about big ideas and watch obama dance on energy. where was the energy issue three weeks ago before i started talking about it?” but mr. gingrich’s increasingly quirky campaign is in danger of descending into irrelevancy, at least as far as the republican nomination is concerned. he harbors a vision in which there is a floor fight at the nominating convention in august and he emerges the choice of the conservative base. he has taken to citing as a precedent the 1920 convention that chose warren g. harding on the 10th ballot — a far-fetched set of circumstances for a modern political party. on friday, mr. gingrich drove two hours south of new orleans along bayous and down lonely causeways to a major oil port, where only 25 voters turned out to hear him speak. his main reason for going, he acknowledged, was to use the national news media to paint the president as an obstacle to offshore drilling. and that may explain mr. gingrich’s true reason for remaining in the race: it keeps him in the spotlight. he clearly relishes the appearances on cnn with piers morgan and on fox news with sean hannity. when he travels, a 10-car motorcade con

Content: i recently celebrated the first anniversary of my grudge against caf?ray. all new yorkers hold restaurant grudges. when something goes really wrong, you say, ''hold it! do i live in sioux city or new york city? there are too many other places that seat me on time or actually serve the entree within an hour of the appetizer or where the noise isn't deafening. forget this place.'' the odds of encountering grudge-inducing disaster are always highest when a restaurant first opens. restaurants, it seems, are all born at age 12: socially awkward with some parts clearly better developed than others. caf?ray was four months on by the time we got there. still a preteen. here's what happened. last winter, my husband and i arranged to meet another couple at 7:30 on a tuesday night. we had eaten at lespinasse, the chef gray kunz's previous temple of cuisine, and looked forward to his great food in less stuffy surroundings. we reserved weeks in advance, but that day, as it happened, the man in the other couple, a corporate executive, had gotten up at 5 a.m., flown to washington and had only just returned. his wife, despite impending snow, had gamely driven in from the suburbs. so our broadly festive aims for the evening had narrowed somewhat to a hot meal, some good wine and home to bed. not so fast. ''the chef would like to offer you a tasting menu,'' the waiter announced, anticipating a round of heartfelt applause. after all, mr. kunz is a big deal. by all rights we should have fallen to our knees in gratitude. never mind that tasting menus take hours to endure. i still have flashbacks of the one i had at bouley more than 10 years ago that featured seven fish courses before the meat kicked in at 11 p.m. but this chef -- this artist -- was offering the opportunity to personally dazzle us. sorry, we said. it's been a long day. another time, perhaps? the waiter handed us our menus wordlessly and it was surely a coincidence that our cocktails were delivered to the next table. but we rallied. the first entree listed was a halibut with mashed potatoes. i'll eat anything that comes with mashed potatoes. the waiter returned. ''the chef is known for his short ribs,'' he declared, his tone freighted with meaning. we had already insulted the chef to the core. if we had any hope of redeeming ourselves, those short ribs were it. ''i'll have the short ribs,'' said our friend, the executive. decades of management experience told him this was his quickest road home. barely mollified, the waiter gave a brief nod. ''i'll have the halibut,'' i said. he frowned. the other woman chimed in, ''you know, that looked good to me, too. i'll

""Exploring the Uncharted: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Adventure""

As I embarked on a cross-country road trip, I found myself immersed in the beauty of America's diverse landscapes. From the quaint town of Cambridge, Maryland, to the bustling streets of New York City, each stop revealed a unique aspect of this great nation.

During my visit to New York City, I had the opportunity to reflect on the importance of personal growth and change. A conversation with a friend about the nature of people's potential for transformation sparked a thought-provoking discussion about the human condition.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, individuals were embracing their passions and exploring new horizons. A group of friends gathered for a potluck party, sharing classic American dishes and laughter, while another family embarked on a road trip to South Carolina and Georgia, enjoying the scenic beauty of Savannah.

In the midst of these adventures, I also discovered the joy of simple pleasures – like reading and ice cream evenings with loved ones. A father's initiative to create a special bonding experience for his children brought smiles to their faces and created lasting memories.

As I continued on my journey, I encountered individuals who were redefining what it means to live a fulfilling life. Preppers and survivalists had shed their old identities and adopted a new approach, one that prioritized self-sufficiency and community building.

Through these encounters, I realized that the true essence of America lies not in its grandeur or iconic landmarks but in

A City's Evolution: From Nightlife to Family-Friendly Resorts

Albany, once known for its vibrant nightlife, has undergone a significant transformation. The city's lawmakers, who would often gather at bars and restaurants near the capitol, began to shift their habits in the 1990s as politics became more partisan. This change led to accusations of harassment and assault, resulting in stricter rules and a less fraternizing atmosphere.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, cities like New York are experiencing a resurgence in fine dining. Restaurants like Peter Luger's and Keens have become popular destinations, offering a unique blend of traditional cuisine with modern touches. These establishments have become hubs for locals and visitors alike, showcasing the city's rich culinary scene.

In contrast, some families are seeking out more relaxed and family-friendly environments. A resort in upstate New York has become a haven for parents and children, offering activities like swimming, fishing, and scavenger hunts. The resort's focus on providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all ages has made it a popular destination for families.

As cities continue to evolve, it's clear that the needs of their residents are changing. From nightlife to family-friendly resorts, New York is proving that there's something for everyone. Whether you're looking for fine dining or a relaxing getaway, the city has something to offer.

It lacks any connection to the actual events described in the ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY, such as a mother throwing a child off a bridge or a heroic 3-year-old saving an elderly man's life. The article instead focuses on hypothetical scenarios that are not supported by facts. In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE ""Tragedy Strikes in Unexpected Places"" presents real-life events and quotes from actual people, making it a more credible source of information.","Survival Situations: Preparing for the Unexpected

As a parent, it's natural to worry about the safety of your children. One unexpected situation that can put them at risk is being caught in water while driving or walking. Heavy rains can cause flash flooding, and bridges collapsing can leave cars submerged.

In some cases, people may be forced to make difficult decisions to protect themselves and their loved ones. For example, a couple was driving across a frozen lake when their truck plunged into the water. The driver's quick thinking saved her life, but it also highlighted the dangers of driving on ice.

In other situations, people may find themselves in unexpected places, such as a hotel room where they're not alone. A family recently experienced this when they arrived at a hotel and found that the bellboy had entered their room without permission.

While these situations can be frightening, there are ways to prepare for them. One woman shared her experience of being visited by a mysterious figure who tapped on her window every night for three months. She eventually caught him in the act and confronted him.

In some cases, people may even find themselves experiencing strange phenomena, such as stepping through a time slip and seeing into the past. While this is not a common occurrence, it's an experience that can be both fascinating and unsettling.

Ultimately, being prepared for unexpected situations is key to staying safe. By taking precautions and being aware of our surroundings, we can reduce the risk of accidents and other dangers. Whether it's carrying life preservers in your car or being mindful of strange occurrences, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones.","Tragedy Strikes in Unexpected Places

In a series of shocking incidents, lives have been forever changed by unexpected events. A woman was struck by a car that crashed into a playground in southeast Harris County, Texas, leaving her with minor injuries. The driver had apparently passed out after visiting a doctor's office.

Meanwhile, in New York City, the sounds of everyday life are being broadcast on elevated train lines. Passengers can be heard discussing everything from professional woes to personal relationships, creating a unique snapshot of urban life.

However, not all interactions are peaceful. A passenger on a flight became agitated and punched another traveler in the arm, leaving them with a painful wound.

In Boston, a city still reeling from past conflicts, residents recall a traumatic event that took place during the busing crisis of 1974. The memory of rage and violence lingers, serving as a reminder of the power of emotions.

On the other side of the country, a heroic 3-year-old saved an elderly man's life by distracting him long enough for his wife to come back and unlock the car door. The child's quick thinking prevented a potentially deadly situation.

In Long Beach, New York, authorities are working to curb aggressive driving habits. A new system allows officers to view traffic from above, helping them identify reckless drivers and issue summonses.

As the world continues to navigate its complexities, it is essential to remember that even in the most unexpected moments, heroism and kindness can prevail.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - survival situations: flood or water in your vehicle
survival situations: flood or water in your vehicle (before it's news) here’s another survival situation to think over. this was brought up in the comments of the winter breakdown survival situations post. heidi said: “a while back, a bridge collapsed (in minnesota, i think?) and cars fell into the water. that immediately made me wonder what i could do to be prepared for that with really young children (we have bridges/water in our area–as well as earthquakes to help knock them down). “i now carry life preservers for each child within my reach and we do emergency evacuation drills of putting them on and exiting out the windows. i’d love to hear other thoughts as well! (i wanted to strap an inflatable raft on the roof, but my husband thought that was a little extreme…). ” as being on a bridge during a collapse is fairly rare, i’ll add to it being caught in any water in your vehicle most likely flooding from heavy rains. i know we don’t get a lot of rain here, but when there is a good storm there’s usually flash flooding in the canyons and i know of one family who lost two small children to a flash flood after getting them unbuckled from their car seats when their vehicle was in the water path because of the force of the water. sometimes there is flooding in a city if a water line breaks also, but i’ve seen many cars at least half submerged because of heavy rains.

the angel that fed me apples (this is a true story and you can find out more by googling herman rosenblat. he was bar mitzvahed at age 75) august 1942. piotrkow, poland. the sky was gloomy that morning as we waited anxiously. all the men, women and children of piotrkow’s jewish ghetto had been herded into a square. word had gotten around that we were being moved. my father had only recently died from typhus, which had run rampant through the crowded ghetto. my greatest fear was that our family would be separated. ‘whatever you do,’ isidore, my eldest brother, whispered to me, ‘don’t tell them your age. say you’re sixteen.’ ‘i was tall for a boy of 11, so i could pull it off. that way i might be deemed valuable as a worker. an ss man approached me, boots clicking against the cobblestones. he looked me up and down, and then asked my age. ‘sixteen,’ i said. he directed me to the left, where my three brothers and other healthy young men already stood. my mother was motioned to the right with the other women, children, sick and elderly people. i whispered to isidore, ‘why?’ he didn’t answer. i ran to mama’s side and said i wanted to stay with her. ‘no, ‘she said stern

Article 3 - outnumbered: a retail tragedy
outnumbered: a retail tragedy (before it's news) i took the kids to the mall today. both of them. at the same time. i try never to do this because it tests my sanity but today it couldn’t be helped. either child on their own is no problem 99% of the time. however, the two together are a volatile mix, the likes of which blow up chemistry classrooms and send chemistry professors into early retirement or a habit of drinking in the closet. but bff’s birthday party is tomorrow and we hadn’t yet found the perfect gift. we’d found many imperfect ones but not the absolute right gift to capture the specialness of the bestest friend in the entire universe, including fairy kingdoms, without whom my daughter would surely perish of sorrow and boredom. so off we went today, all three of us, to the mall. dum dum dum dum. i should mention that conor has skinned and reskinned his knees again, so he’s working his dickensian limp while holding his shorts up, like tiny tim learning to curtsy. it is impressively tragic. immediately after entering the mall conor wanted to be carried with his imaginary cane to the disney store. scrooge mommy denied his request. the disney store didn’t have the item we sought. they also didn’t have the back-up item riley came up with after 15 minutes of coercion. conor on the other hand found 50 things he desperately

Article 4 - thailand – road trip
thailand – road trip (before it's news) we drove to krabi from phuket, stopping along the way at wat kaeo manne si mahathat (blog post here). our main reason, well, only reason for going to krabi, was to use it as a base from which to visit the huay toh waterfalls(blog post here) and the tiger cave temple (wat tham sua). after the visit to huay toh waterfall, neither of us were in any state to climb the 1000+ steps to the top of tiger cave temple (wat tham sua ), so we just visited the parts at ground level. we weren’t the only visitors who decided not to walk to the top, there were several other tourists who also stayed at ground level, mainly because they were concerned about walking past the dozens of monkeys who were happily climbing up the legs of passers by. the town of krabi is an ok place to spend a couple of nights. there are a several places to eat and drink and a couple of night food markets. we did not explore krabi much because after being out and about all day, all we wanted to do was rest, but it was a pleasant two night stay. photo of tiger cave temple (wat tham sua) after departing krabi we headed south to get on to the scenic road across to the east coast. i had thought is would be slow going, so had a vague idea of where

Article 6 - the tapping black stick man that frightened his mom
(before it's news) jc, who often sends me interesting bits and pieces, sent me the following story. he was wondering if this could have been a black stick man sighting. it’s certainly a strange story! when my mother was about 18 she was visited by what she calls the tapper. every night for three months, something would tap on the window of the room she was in, but only when she was alone. this would happen even if the curtains were drawn. every single night, without fail, this would happen. as soon as anyone else went into the room, or outside to investigate, the tapping would stop. my grandpa and both my uncles were living in the house too. after three months of this tapping it suddenly ceased. as the silence continued for two weeks grandpa and my two uncles decided to go on a fishing trip one night while my mom stayed at home. it was just getting dark and my mom was sitting in the living room reading. then she heard a tap … tap … tap … tap. she assumed it was the youngest uncle trying to scare her, as it was the sort of thing he would do. “bill, knock it off,” mom shouted. the tap … tap … tap continued, “bill it’s not funny, stop it!” tap … tap … tap … mom got up from the couch and anxiously went to the window. “very f****** funny bill!” and she tapped on the inside of the window herself.

this is the terrifying moment a couple’s truck smashes through ice after they made the decision to drive over a frozen lake. ko’ona cochrane and her partner made the trip across the ice because they thought it would be quicker than driving all the way around. they assumed that the frozen water on top of the lake was 36 inches deep because the weather had been quite cold. ko’ona captured the frightening moment on facebook live because she was filming the truck crossing near hecla islan, around 150km north of winnipeg, in canada. the truck can be seen plunging into the water as ko’ona screams and tells her partner to “bail”. she is then heard yelling: “that’s my life, take that!” as she grabs a bag filled with her belongings. speaking to cbc news , ko’ona said: “we figured we would save two hours by going from manigotagan across the lake.” but as the couple started driving, they noticed a large crack and made the decision to veer off in another direction. “but there was another crack there and the next thing you knew our truck went down. “my partner slowed down to avoid it but it swallowed the truck.” watch the video: source: mirror

Article 8 - hotel empee, madurai, tamal nadu
hotel empee, madurai, tamal nadu (before it's news) before heading to madurai we searched online for a nice hotel. a lot were over our budget, and others had no vacancies, but we did find one that sounded alright, hotel empee, so we phoned and made a reservation for one night. we’d spent about 5 hours on a small cramped non air-conditioned bus before arriving in madurai in the early evening. we were hot, tired and eager to get to our hotel, which we walked to from where the bus dropped us. the welcome at hotel empee was unfriendly. we were shown a room up on the fifth floor, it looked fine so we dumped our bags and i stayed in the room while richard went back down to reception to check in. our room cost rs.1,500 per night. a few minutes later richard returned to our room. i opened the door to let richard in, i then pushed the door to shut it, but i couldn’t because the bellboy forced his way in. i hadn’t realised he was there as there was no reason for him to come to our room as we had already brought all of our luggage etc. up wth us. typically, despite having done nothing for us the bellboy wanted money. straight away neither of us liked our room. we’re not quite sure why. it was fairly clean, quite big, and we had everything you’d expect in

Article 9 - stepping through a time slip and into her previous life
stepping through a time slip and into her previous life (before it's news) i recently published a post stepping into a different time zone or time slip and, because it was quite popular, i thought i would re-publish a similar themed story from five years ago. this was from a mr. thomas and is about a time shift and seeing into the past and perhaps a former life. i had cause some years back to go and collect a load of straw from some farm buildings in gloucestershire. a colleague, anne, came with me for the ride, which i undertook in a small lorry, not much bigger than a pick-up truck. i collected the straw and took this to the lorry. i noticed that anne looked a little strained when i got ready to drive back, but i didn’t mention the fact to her. after we had delivered the straw she told me what had happened at the farm. she said that as soon as i had left the cab, to load the straw, the whole place changed. she was now in a courtyard with other buildings at the side of the yard. she saw herself as standing in the centre of the courtyard but as a young woman of about fifteen or sixteen years old (whereas in fact she was in her early twenties). the young woman she saw in the courtyard in no way resembled her and was dressed as a servant girl from past centuries. despite this she instantly knew this woman was actually herself and she suddenly found herself

Article 10 - the disappearance at eilean mor lighthouse
the disappearance at eilean mor lighthouse (before it's news) the eilean mor lighthouse the outer hebrides island chain off the western coast of scotland is one of the most remote locations in the world, bedrock formed of ancient metamorphic rock home to the carloway broch, and loch ness and its famous monster. the flannan isles, also known as the seven hunters, are seven uninhabited islands on the western-most edge of the chain; and in december 1900, the largest of these — eilean mor (gaelic for “big island”) — became the site of an unsolved mystery when three lighthouse keepers vanished without any apparent explanation. the atlantic ocean off the flannan isles is rough and treacherous. so many ships had been lost there that in 1895, a lighthouse was finally built on eilean mor – an undertaking of considerable logistical difficulty as the building materials had to be hauled up a 150 foot cliff (45 meters.) once construction was finished, three lighthouse keepers were installed: head keeper james ducat, first assistant thomas marshall, and second assistant donald mcarthur. all three men were seasoned veterans of the storms; ducat, 43, had over 20 years experience at lighthouse keeping, while marshall and mcarthur were both seamen. the keepers worked on a rotating watch

Article 1 - car plows into playground and strikes woman
by mike glenn and keri blakinger updated 8:33 pm, monday, november 21, 2016 crazy scene that could've been so much worse. car crashes through playground where kids were playing #khou11 pic.twitter.com/qahmhqx0cv — josh chapin (@joshchapinkhou) november 22, 2016 a woman was hospitalized after she was struck by a car that crashed into a playground in southeast harris county on monday afternoon. the car went out of control about 4:30 p.m., running into a playground near el dorado boulevard and pilgrims point drive, authorities said. the car went through a fence and drove onto the playground area. harris county sheriff's deputies said a woman at the park saw the car and pulled a child out of the way. the car hit the woman in the leg. she was taken to an area hospital with minor injuries. the child also was taken to the hospital to be checked out, sheriff's deputies said. deputies said the driver had apparently passed out shortly after she left a nearby doctor's office. the incident remains under investigation and sheriff's officials said no charges have been filed in the case.

Article 2 - phones in subway: on elevated lines, hear the future
but the cellphones have been used for years on the city’s elevated lines, where a given car might include a dozen travelers talking by phone in nearly as many languages, unashamed to expose the train to daily tales of professional woe, family squabbling or questionable relationship behavior. taken together, the chats offer not only a glimpse of new york’s underground future, but also a unique view of its present — a medley of a city as it moves, the key shifting above each neighborhood. those who have cherished the relative peace of a subway ride lament the shift; others have cheered it as the urban equivalent of elevator music. “it kind of complements the ride,” said kimberley malone, from the upper west side, a frequent chatter and close listener on the seventh avenue line. “you don’t have to make eye contact.” for veterans, the rhythms have become well established. as an outdoor stretch approaches on each aboveground line — just east of the hunters point avenue station in queens , perhaps, or at the towering smith-ninth street station on the f line in brooklyn — passengers reach for their phones, even before service has arrived. on a recent weekday afternoon aboard a no. 7 train car in queens, 11 of 23 passengers were using their phones. two others appeared to be reading. quite frequently, unassuming passengers can absorb entire narratives without trying, particularly on less crowded trains, where riders often speak louder, projecting as if to fill the

Article 4 - messing with the wrong city
boston when i was 9 years old, at the height of the busing crisis in 1974, i drove with my parents and brother through south boston on our way to dorchester, where we lived. on west broadway we got stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic and crawled for a mile through one of the more frightening mass gatherings i’ve ever witnessed. effigies of judge arthur garrity and senator edward kennedy and mayor kevin white were hung from street lamps and set afire. the flames were reflected in the windows of my father’s chevy, and i looked through them at the faces of a mob so incensed it was medieval. reason was not popular on west broadway that night. nor was compassion or a desire to debate our differences with nuance or a respect for complexity. in the place of civil discourse, rage ruled. i bring this up now, in the wake of a terrorist attack on the city where i was born and from which i draw my creative fuel, for two reasons. 1) because that night was my ur-experience, if you will, with rage. i’d seen anger, of course, and i’d seen violence, too, but rage — beyond reason, beyond intellect, beyond conciliation — was a different beast. 2) when i speak of my love for this city, it will be understood that the love does not come filtered through a soft-focus lens. i’m fully aware of the

at the same time, he said, the department’s 45 patrol officers have issued about 400 more traffic summonses, a 20 percent increase. “the majority of violators are from suffolk — patchogue, islip and ronkonkoma,” lieutenant tangney said, noting that commuters from those areas drive south across the robert moses causeway and then zip west through lido beach and into long beach. photo to speed through long beach during the morning rush means drivers must swerve around other cars, often cutting across the middle lane of traffic on the main thoroughfare, park avenue. it was these aggressive drivers that lieutenant tangney said he wanted to stop, but until recently he had no idea how because officers in patrol cars often cannot see all of the reckless moves. “i went on top of buildings to see the traffic, but the angle was not good enough and at certain times of the year trees obstructed the roadway,” he said. “but one day they were putting up banners on street poles, and i saw a guy in a bucket and i said to myself, ‘there’s my point of view.’ ” the department, aided by the nassau county traffic safety board, received a $12,000 grant from the governor’s traffic safety committee. since the bucket was put into use in february, it has been employed a dozen times in a four-hour period during the morning rush. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're

Article 7 - the reception thaws a bit, but the two-week forecast remains unclear
logistical problems have been especially pressing for many of the 10,000 journalists here. with long distances between events and news media centers, and between turin and the mountains, reporters have complained of long waits and travel times. but to the average fan -- and to merchants hoping for more business, now and in the future -- the games seem to be clicking tentatively into gear. (organizers' early figures showed 55,000 people attended events saturday, the first day of competition, and about 11.5 million italians watched the opening ceremony on television).

Article 8 - turning the ride to school into a walk
safely moving children to and from school and after-school activities is a matter of great concern, not only to parents, but also to the american academy of pediatrics, which in july issued a policy statement on school transportation safety. school buses versus cars the academy’s statistics on injuries and fatalities suggest that being driven to school in a passenger vehicle is by far the most dangerous way to get there, and riding in a school bus is the safest. seventy-five percent of the fatalities and 84 percent of the injuries occur in passenger vehicles, but just 2 percent of student deaths and 4 percent of injuries result from travel by school bus. the numbers might not tell a complete story. the academy’s committee on injury, violence and poison prevention and the council on school health pointed out that “school bus crash data are incomplete, and that injuries cannot be reliably estimated. “the first emergency-department-based study of nonfatal school-bus-related injuries found that the number of injuries, 17,000 annually to children 0 to 19 years of age, greatly exceeded previously published estimates.” when the minneapolis highway bridge collapsed this summer and a school bus filled with children plunged toward the mississippi river, witnesses described children “flying” around in the bus. there are just two ways that could have occurred. either the bus was not equipped with safety restraints or the children, all of whom escaped safely, were not buckled in. photo before child-restraint systems and safety belts

the sturdy tree on cross bay boulevard in queens was struck with such force that it was uprooted, ripping up the surrounding asphalt and cobblestones. the van that hit the tree burst into flames and burned so fiercely that the asphalt underneath it melted and a utility pole 10 feet away was charred. the heat stripped every bit of cushion from the seats — the single ones that had been in the front, and the long ones behind it — turning them into eerie wire skeletons. of the van’s 10 occupants, 9 residents of a brooklyn home for the mentally ill and their driver, 5 were able to escape. the others were so badly entangled that they could not be pulled out, witnesses said. “i couldn’t look at them, i turned away,” said keith johnson, 50, a city bus driver who arrived to offer help. this was the gruesome scene yesterday afternoon on cross bay boulevard, which connects the rockaways to the rest of queens, after the van carrying residents of brooklyn manor from a hospital in the rockaways veered off the road and rammed into the tree. the passengers, who the police said were not wearing seat belts, were jumbled in a tangled wedge at the front of the van. the driver and one passenger escaped on their own, and three other passengers were pulled out by two men who stopped to help. mounting flames prevented the rescuers from pulling out the remaining five. onlookers looked

Survival Situations: Preparing for the Unexpected

As a parent, it's natural to worry about the safety of your children. One unexpected situation that can put them at risk is being caught in water while driving or walking. Heavy rains can cause flash flooding, and bridges collapsing can leave cars submerged.

In some cases, people may be forced to make difficult decisions to protect themselves and their loved ones. For example, a couple was driving across a frozen lake when their truck plunged into the water. The driver's quick thinking saved her life, but it also highlighted the dangers of driving on ice.

In other situations, people may find themselves in unexpected places, such as a hotel room where they're not alone. A family recently experienced this when they arrived at a hotel and found that the bellboy had entered their room without permission.

While these situations can be frightening, there are ways to prepare for them. One woman shared her experience of being visited by a mysterious figure who tapped on her window every night for three months. She eventually caught him in the act and confronted him.

In some cases, people may even find themselves experiencing strange phenomena, such as stepping through a time slip and seeing into the past. While this is not a common occurrence, it's an experience that can be both fascinating and unsettling.

Ultimately, being prepared for unexpected situations is key to staying safe. By taking precautions and being aware of our surroundings, we can reduce the risk of accidents and other dangers. Whether it's carrying

Tragedy Strikes in Unexpected Places

In a series of shocking incidents, lives have been forever changed by unexpected events. A woman was struck by a car that crashed into a playground in southeast Harris County, Texas, leaving her with minor injuries. The driver had apparently passed out after visiting a doctor's office.

Meanwhile, in New York City, the sounds of everyday life are being broadcast on elevated train lines. Passengers can be heard discussing everything from professional woes to personal relationships, creating a unique snapshot of urban life.

However, not all interactions are peaceful. A passenger on a flight became agitated and punched another traveler in the arm, leaving them with a painful wound.

In Boston, a city still reeling from past conflicts, residents recall a traumatic event that took place during the busing crisis of 1974. The memory of rage and violence lingers, serving as a reminder of the power of emotions.

On the other side of the country, a heroic 3-year-old saved an elderly man's life by distracting him long enough for his wife to come back and unlock the car door. The child's quick thinking prevented a potentially deadly situation.

In Long Beach, New York, authorities are working to curb aggressive driving habits. A new system allows officers to view traffic from above, helping them identify reckless drivers and issue summonses.

As the world continues to navigate its complexities, it is essential to remember that even in the most unexpected moments, heroism and kindness can prevail.

In a bold act of defiance, a group of environmental activists recently vandalized one of President Trump's golf courses in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The group, which identifies as an ""anonymous environmental activist collective,"" used six-foot-tall letters to carve a message into the green: ""No more tigers. No more woods.""

The vandalism was reportedly a response to the Trump administration's policies on environmental protection. The activists claimed that their actions were a direct result of the president's decisions, which they saw as a threat to the natural world.

Meanwhile, in other news, a sharpshooting veteran recently saved an eagle stuck in a tree near Rush City, Minnesota. The eagle had its leg caught in a piece of rope wrapped around a branch, about 70 feet off the ground.

In golfing circles, some are reminiscing about past Masters moments. Fred Couples' gravity-defying shot at the 12th hole in 1992 is often cited as one of the most incredible shots in tournament history.

As natural gas prices continue to drop, companies are cutting back on drilling operations. The recent boom in shale drilling has slowed, with experts predicting fewer wells will be drilled in 2012.

Tiger Woods, one of golf's most iconic players, has been struggling to find his form on the course. Despite his impressive skills, he has been plagued by inconsistent shots and poor putting.

In a recent round, Woods' tee shot soared high into the fairway, but his follow-up shots were less than stellar. He bogeyed several holes, including a double bogey on the fifth hole, where his ball landed in the water. His playing partners, Casey Wittenberg and others, tried to offer words of encouragement, but even their support couldn't lift Woods' spirits.

Woods' struggles have been evident throughout his career, with some critics labeling him as ""unpredictable."" However, he has consistently demonstrated his ability to bounce back from adversity. In a recent interview, Woods acknowledged that he was struggling, saying, ""I didn't know which way I was going to go, whether I was going left or right.""

Despite his struggles, Woods remains confident in his abilities and is determined to improve. He has been working hard to regain his form, and it will be interesting to see how he performs in future rounds.

In contrast, other golfers have been having successful tournaments. Phil Mickelson, for example, has been playing some of the best golf of his career, with several birdies and an eagle on the course. His confidence is evident, as he said, ""I want to put everything I have into this one event.""

on sunday morning, a group of environmental activists horribly defaced one of president trump’s golf courses. washington post reports: the group — which labels itself an “anonymous environmental activist collective” — snuck into trump national golf club in rancho palos verdes, calif., and carved a message into the green with six-foot-tall letters that said: “no more tigers. no more woods.” the 18-hole, 7,300-yard course is set among cliffs overlooking the pacific ocean just south of los angeles. last year, golf digest ranked it the 43rd best course in california. in a statement sent to the washington post, the group said the vandalism was carried out in response to the trump administration’s “blatant disregard” for the environment. “in response to the president’s recent decision to gut our existing protection policies, direct action was conceived and executed on the green of his california golf course in the form of a simple message: no more tigers. no more woods,” the statement said. the golf course did not respond to multiple requests for comment, nor did the trump organization’s new york headquarters. share on facebook and twitter if you agree that these environmentalists need to face jail-time! http://www.wedgies.com/question/should-trumps-department-of-justice-investigate-obamas-wire-tapping-and-slush-fund-fkzmjvz87c

(before it's news) joseph herrin apocalypse by viktor vasnetsov the media has been giving much attention in recent days to the ebola outbreak in africa, fearing that it may spread to other continents and nations of the world. ebola is a particularly frightening sickness due to its rapid onset and development and unusually high mortality rate. some media figures have suggested that 80% – 90% of people infected with ebola end up dying. it sounds like the ultimate dream virus for malthusian globalists like prince philip, ted turner, and bill gates who believe the world is horribly overpopulated and that humanity needs to be greatly reduced in numbers. prince philip, the duke of edinburgh and husband of queen elizabeth ii, infamously stated, “in the event that i am reincarnated, i would like to return as a deadly virus, to contribute something to solving overpopulation.” i occasionally listen to the corbett report, produced by james corbett who resides in “the always sunny climes of western japan.” not having visited his site in a couple months, i thought to do so in order to see if he had shared any thoughts on the media’s peddling of the ebola story. i was not disappointed. james had some good insights to share on the subject. http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-293-the-ebola-effect/ there is both an audio and a video form of this broadcast available at

what threshold permits the press to examine the private lives of public figures, anyway? there is no right answer; only stumbling attempts to find a compromise to suit each discrete indiscreet circumstance. matters grow tougher when it comes to the treatment of truly private citizens, like monica lewinsky or donna rice, who are embroiled in a scandal. the times is in an especially awkward position because it holds itself as a exemplar of decorum and civility. “there can certainly be some tension here,” philip b. corbett, the times’s standards editor, said. “on the one hand, we don’t want to deprive readers of newsworthy information, and we don’t think of them as delicate creatures who need to be shielded from unsavory goings-on. on the other hand, lurid gossip or mere sensationalism is not really what readers come to us for.” times reporters and editors donned kid gloves in 1884 to describe charges — first reported in the buffalo evening telegraph — that gov. grover cleveland of new york, the democratic candidate for president, had fathered a child out of wedlock with maria halpin of buffalo. it seemed beyond dispute that mr. cleveland had paid some child support money to mrs. halpin, but his partisans spun that as an act of gallantry by a bachelor in a case where the true paternity was unclear.

Article 9 - eyes on woods, but everyman takes control
the cheer that rumbled across the almost empty golf course was like the first hint of thunder from an approaching storm. but the cheers did not foreshadow the revival of woods’s golf game, just the arrival of an old-style woods gallery — a multihued conglomeration of nationalities and races, much like those he attracted earlier in his career. it was accompanied by a discreet but visible police presence — both uniformed and undercover, on foot, on bicycles and on segways — as a reminder of the changes that have come into his life recently. photo a most unwelcome change to his on-course life is what woods calls “the two-way miss,” the shot that goes off line, either left or right. it first appeared in competition during his return to the game three weeks ago at the masters. it appeared at the second tee, when his tee shot darted left, and popped up at various times throughout his round. while the crowd remained resolutely positive in its receptions for woods, he was largely unaware of it as he struggled to somehow rein in his recalcitrant golf game. “i was struggling so bad today,” he said. “i didn’t know which way i was going to go, whether i was going left or right. i didn’t really hear much, to be honest with you, i was struggling so bad out there. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address

Article 10 - garcía taking british open lead in stride
the grind of major championship golf seemed to take its toll on the field, and even players with placid personalities lashed out. photo henrik stenson swiped at a tee marker in anger after a poor drive on no. 8, and ernie els let loose some acidic words after missing a birdie putt on no. 9. “normally, i keep it all in, but i thought, ‘maybe let me get everything out,’ ” els said. “i didn’t see too many small kids, so hopefully, they all closed their ears. that’s what a major does to you. nobody’s made of rock out here.” woods, the player considered closest to granite, cracked on his first tee shot of the day, when he steered an iron shot left of the fairway and toward the barry burn running along the rough. a gaggle of children gave chase, but the ball was soon in the water, leaving woods with a double bogey. his round included several more poor swings, including a tee shot that flared right on no. 15 and a bogey after a wayward approach shot on no. 18. “it’s not like you don’t make bad swings in major championships,” said woods, who is seeking his third consecutive british open title. “that’s part of the deal.” asked if he believed he could still win, he said, “at one over par, i’m not out of it.” mickelson,

Environmental Activists Target Trump's Golf Course

In a bold act of defiance, a group of environmental activists recently vandalized one of President Trump's golf courses in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The group, which identifies as an ""anonymous environmental activist collective,"" used six-foot-tall letters to carve a message into the green: ""No more tigers. No more woods.""

The vandalism was reportedly a response to the Trump administration's policies on environmental protection. The activists claimed that their actions were a direct result of the president's decisions, which they saw as a threat to the natural world.

Tiger Woods' Struggles on the Course

Tiger Woods, one of golf's most iconic players, has been struggling to find his form on the course. Despite his impressive skills, he has been plagued by inconsistent shots and poor putting.

In a recent round, Woods' tee shot soared high into the fairway, but his follow-up shots were less than stellar. He bogeyed several holes, including a double bogey on the fifth hole, where his ball landed in the water. His playing partners, Casey Wittenberg and others, tried to offer words of encouragement, but even their support couldn't lift Woods' spirits.

Woods' struggles have been evident throughout his career, with some critics labeling him as ""unpredictable."" However, he has consistently demonstrated his ability to bounce back from adversity. In a recent interview, Woods acknowledged that he was struggling, saying, ""I didn't know which way I was going to go, whether I was going left or right.""

Despite his struggles, Woods remains confident in his abilities and is determined to improve. He has been working hard to regain his form, and it will be interesting to see how he performs in future rounds.

In contrast, other golfers have been having successful tournaments. Phil Mickelson, for example, has been playing some of the best golf of his career, with several birdies and an eagle on the course. His confidence is evident, as he said, ""I want to put everything I have into

A recent photo of President Trump and evangelical leader Paula White at a strategy meeting has sparked speculation about their interaction. In the image, Trump is seen pulling out a chair for White, who sat down in front of him. While some have interpreted this as a gesture of respect, others have suggested that it may be perceived as flirtatious.

White, a longtime supporter of Trump and an ally to the president, has been vocal about her spiritual views and relationship with God. She has also praised Trump's accessibility and willingness to engage with conservative groups.

Meanwhile, protests against President Trump continued across the country, including in Park City at the Sundance Film Festival. The event was marked by chants of ""F*ck Donald Trump"" and signs reading ""Free Melania"" and ""Make Russia Great Again.""

In other news, Vice President Joe Biden's wife reported that he had thrown away a container of pink-ribbon harvest peach yogurt after a meeting with the Komen for the Cure breast cancer agency. The agency had announced plans to stop funding Planned Parenthood.

President Trump has also been in the spotlight for his criticism of actress Meryl Streep, who delivered an emotional speech at the Golden Globes. Trump took to social media to defend himself against what he perceived as a personal attack.

In a separate development, artist Illma Gore's nude painting of President Trump with a fictional micro-penis has sparked controversy and death threats. The painting was initially banned from Facebook but has since been viewed millions of times on Reddit.

These incidents highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding President Trump's presidency and the diverse reactions to his policies and actions.","As the US presidential election nears its climax, celebrities are using their platforms to support their preferred candidates. In a recent rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, pop star Lady Gaga joined forces with rocker Jon Bon Jovi to perform his 1980s classic ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and deliver a stirring speech in support of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., a surprising friendship between Ted Cruz and David Pantone has been making headlines. The two men met as college roommates at Princeton University, where Pantone was considered the more likely to run for office. Despite their differing views on politics, Pantone has spoken highly of Cruz's character, describing him as ""principled but a good guy.""

In other news, Kanye West has canceled all remaining dates of his Saint Pablo tour due to exhaustion. The rapper has been working non-stop on fashion design projects and has also been dealing with the stress of his wife Kim Kardashian West's traumatic armed robbery in Paris.

At a recent Unicef gala, Hillary Clinton made a surprise appearance, highlighting her commitment to helping improve everyday lives for American women. Her speech was met with applause from the audience, who were inspired by her words.

In a lighter moment, Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah's AMAs opening monologue included a hilarious Melania Trump impression and an impromptu song. The duo poked fun at the recent election, but ultimately focused on celebrating music and entertainment.

Content: elton john sends a message at aids foundation gala: ‘love trumps hate’ seth kelley pin it share andy cohen opened the elton john aids foundation’s 15th annual an enduring vision gala, held at cipriani wall street on wednesday, with a quick rundown. “sir elton is wearing bedazzled gucci,” cohen said. “the cubs are winning 1 – 0. it’s the top of the second. i am so butch, i can’t even handle it.” and with less than a week until the 2016 presidential election, he added, “nate silver has hillary clinton at 68% of winning and donald trump at 32%.” that, he said, was all the attendees needed to know about the world, and with that, the evening began. set in a luxurious ballroom with 70-foot-high ceilings and an elaborately detailed dome, the evening theme featured colors of red and blue blended together in the mood lighting and popped in table cloths on which guest were served a beet and goat cheese salad on a bed of asparagus, creamy risotto, and beef with a porcini mushroom sauce and tiramisu for dessert (not to mention an assortment of libations, bubbly and otherwise). elton john who, indeed, looked fantastic in studded shoes and a jacket embroidered with his first name across the back, spoke about the event’s 15-year history. he started his remarks by asking, “does any of this make a difference? are we making progress against the aids epidemic?” (and later concluded “yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.”) still, no event so close to a historic election could exist without at least some political reference. “we have an enduring vision of a more compassionate world where no one is ever treated as ‘less than’ no matter their race, their sexuality, or their gender — a world where love trumps hate,” he said, then off-hand, “i know i’d get the word ‘trump’ in there somewhere.” the black-tie event brought out the likes of actors alan cumming , jeffrey tambor, and matthew morrison , as well as tv host and author padma lakshmi . before the evening carried on with an auction and live musical performance, the event honored philanthropists frank giustra and steve tisch , as well as united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon . the latter declared that he envisioned an aids-free world by 2030. “we can get there,” he said, reflecting on his own relationship to lgbt activism. “if my 20-year-old self could see me talking about these issues, he would have been very surprised,” he said. “but i am happy to say i found my voice. and every day more and more people are finding theirs.” related stories

President Trump's Visit to the White House: A Photo Sparks Speculation

A recent photo of President Trump and evangelical leader Paula White at a strategy meeting has sparked speculation about their interaction. In the image, Trump is seen pulling out a chair for White, who sat down in front of him. While some have interpreted this as a gesture of respect, others have suggested that it may be perceived as flirtatious.

White, a longtime supporter of Trump and an ally to the president, has been vocal about her spiritual views and relationship with God. She has also praised Trump's accessibility and willingness to engage with conservative groups.

Meanwhile, protests against President Trump continued across the country, including in Park City at the Sundance Film Festival. The event was marked by chants of ""F*ck Donald Trump"" and signs reading ""Free Melania"" and ""Make Russia Great Again.""

In other news, Vice President Joe Biden's wife reported that he had thrown away a container of pink-ribbon harvest peach yogurt after a meeting with the Komen for the Cure breast cancer agency. The agency had announced plans to stop funding Planned Parenthood.

President Trump has also been in the spotlight for his criticism of actress Meryl Streep, who delivered an emotional speech at the Golden Globes. Trump took to social media to defend himself against what he perceived as a personal attack.

In a separate development, artist Illma Gore's nude painting of President Trump with a fictional micro-penis has sparked controversy and death threats. The painting

The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides a clear and concise explanation of the market fluctuations caused by Donald Trump's presidency, citing specific data points such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average's decline.  In contrast, both the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE and the ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY contain sensational language and speculative claims about global economic uncertainty and potential market crashes. The ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY also contains unsubstantiated claims about a possible Ebola contagion triggering a market crash, which is not supported by credible sources.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, presents a more balanced view of the market situation, acknowledging both the risks and uncertainties associated with Trump's presidency while providing context and data to support its analysis. This suggests that the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is a more reliable source of information than the ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY.  The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE, however, contains several red flags, including unsubstantiated claims about a ""leadership reversal"" in the market and an overemphasis on speculative topics such as digital currencies. These characteristics suggest that the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE is not a credible source of information.","Market Sentiment Shifts as Global Tensions Rise

The recent market fluctuations have been attributed to a combination of factors, including global economic uncertainty and rising tensions between major world powers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced significant declines in recent days, with Wednesday's 138-point drop marking the largest single-day decline since September.

Analysts point to a ""leadership reversal"" in the market, where stocks setting new 52-week lows outnumber those hitting new highs. This shift is seen as a sign of deteriorating market internals and a potential warning sign for investors.

The technology sector has also been under pressure, with major players such as Apple Inc., Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation experiencing significant declines. The decline is attributed to the strengthening US dollar and falling euro, which have led to a decrease in investor confidence.

Meanwhile, protests against Wall Street greed have gained momentum globally, with demonstrators in cities across Europe and the United States calling for greater economic equality. The Occupy Wall Street movement has seen widespread participation, with thousands of people gathering in Times Square on October 15th.

In the financial sector, concerns over the US government shutdown have led to a decrease in investor confidence, although markets remain relatively stable. Analysts predict that the situation may lead to increased action by the Federal Reserve and potentially impact global markets.

As investors navigate these complex market dynamics, it is essential to stay informed about the latest developments and adjust strategies accordingly. With tensions rising globally, it is crucial to be prepared for potential market fluctuations and to maintain a cautious approach.","Market Volatility Reigns as Trump's Victory Sparks Global Uncertainty

The recent US presidential election has sent shockwaves through global markets, with investors scrambling to adjust their portfolios in response to the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's presidency. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted on Wednesday, marking its largest single-day decline since 2008.

Analysts point to a risk-off trade as investors seek safer assets, such as bonds and gold, amid concerns over Trump's policies and potential impact on global markets. The prospect of higher interest rates and trade tensions has also contributed to the volatility.

In contrast, some sectors are bucking the trend, with technology stocks showing resilience despite concerns about their valuations. However, experts warn that this rally may not last, citing the market's high volatility as a worrisome sign.

Meanwhile, investors are taking cues from other markets, such as Greece, where the bailout deal has sparked concerns over its impact on global financial markets. The Greek bond market is seen as a bellwether for the US economy, with some analysts predicting that a successful bailout will be bullish for stocks in the short term but bearish in the long term.

As investors navigate this uncertain landscape, they are also keeping an eye on other emerging trends, such as the rise of digital currencies like ether and bitcoin. However, experts caution that these assets are highly speculative and may be due for a correction.

With markets still reeling from the election news, investors are advised to remain cautious and monitor developments closely. The coming days will be crucial in determining the trajectory of global markets, and investors would do well to stay informed about the latest market trends and analysis.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - 3 ominous signals appeared before last financial crisis, appearing now
3 ominous signals appeared before last financial crisis, appearing now % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by michael synder we have not seen a “leadership reversal”, a “hindenburg omen” and a “titanic syndrome signal” all appear simultaneously since just before the last financial crisis. does this mean that a stock market crash is imminent? not necessarily, but as i have been writing about quite a bit recently, the markets are certainly primed for one. on wednesday, the dow fell another 138 points, and that represented the largest single day decline that we have seen since september. much more importantly, the downward trend that has been developing over the past week appears to be accelerating. just take a look at this chart. could we be right on the precipice of a major move to the downside? john hussman certainly seems to think so. he is the one that pointed out that we have not seen this sort of a threefold sell signal since just before the last financial crisis. the following comes from business insider… on tuesday, the number of new york stock exchange companies setting new 52-week lows climbed above the number hitting new highs, representing a “leadership reversal” that hussman says highlights the deterioration of market internals. stocks also received confirmation of two bearish market-breadth readings known as the hindenburg omen and the titanic syndrome. hussman says these three

technology turns south (before it's news) early in the day, stocks like apple inc. (nasdaq:aapl) were higher while other sectors were weak. that has changed as of mid day in the markets. the markets continue to be under pressure from a falling euro and rising dollar. technology which had held up nicely is now swooning. apple inc. hit a high today of $$256.18 in early trading but now sits at $$248.00, over $$8.00 off its highs. the markets are breaking the lows from friday as things in europe continue to look ugly. other technology stocks that initially started the day with gains are oracle corporation (nasdaq:orcl), qualcomm, inc. (nasdaq:qcom) and microsoft corporation (nasdaq:msft). it is amazing to see every sector in the market eventually succumb to the euro drop and the dollar strength. the markets rallied non stop months ago on a weak dollar and now cannot handle a rise in the dollar. while it seems that currencies have all the control in the markets over the ups and downs, it is the underlying factors of why the currencies are moving in their directions that really drives the market. stay tuned as this market continues to get slammed down. gareth soloway chief market strategist www.inthemoneystocks.com read the original story at in the money stocks

Article 4 - stock market report – it’s a turkey – november 24, 2011
(before it's news) when i last sent out an article for public consumption we were talking about greece and the potential for a wide spread problem in europe. the g-20 was about to meet and there was wild anticipation that a eu “solution” to the sovereign debt crisis was finally at hand. by now we know that europe has yet to do anything to alleviate the situation. in the us we learned two days ago that the “super committee” was a super bust. they weren’t able to agree on anything so a series of automatic cuts, to be implemented two years down the road, totaling us $$1 trillion will take place. that’s a far cry from the us $$3.7 trillion that they were aiming for and is typical of the political leadership on both sides of the pond. in our november 1st report i took a look at china as they announced the implementation of monetary easing just months after announcing a policy of monetary tightening. that is something that central banks hate to do because it’s an admission that a mistake has been made. as you can see below, the easing produced a momentary surge in the shanghai exchange: unfortunately the move higher didn’t last, stopping at resistance as you can see in the chart, and has now turned back down. we can also see that rsi, macd and the histogram are all headed lower and late last week we saw a gap down on the open that remains unfilled. so since the november 1st report

death of the us dollar reserve currency picking up speed (before it's news) by steve st. angelo / goldseek the death of the u.s. dollar as the world’s reserve currency will have a profoundly negative impact on the lives of most americans. unfortunately, 99% of the population has no clue. the only reason 1% of u.s. citizens understand what is going on, is because the mainstream media and financial networks have distorted the truth and the reality of our present situation. what happened in the markets today was a perfect example. zerohedge published an article today titled, ‘traders’ panic-buy stocks, shrug off nuclear armaggedon, debt ceiling, & biblical flood fears, and stating the following: for a few brief hours overnight – until the bell rang at 0930et on the nyse – investors were anxious about north korea’s most provocative yet missile launch, the terrible flooding disaster in texas, and lest we forget, the looming debt ceiling debacle. but all of that was instantly forgotten as the machines took control and lifted stocks higher practically all day on a sea of usdjpy-ignited momentum. looking at the chart above, we can see that when fear came into the markets during the north korea missile incident and then the opening of the european markets (shown in the two red boxes), the dow jones index fell as well as the usdjpy, while gold and the u.s. treasurys

Article 1 - stocks register impressive gains for second consecutive session
adding to investors' cheer, several important companies posted first-quarter earnings well ahead of analysts' expectations. in the technology sector, intel and america online, which reported earnings after the market closed, both handily beat estimates by analysts. old-economy stocks also showed their strength, with drug companies pfizer and johnson & johnson both posting higher-than-expected profits. even so, several money managers and wall street strategists pointed to signs that the rally may not last. while earnings are growing fast, many technology stocks remain expensive, and the market's unusually high volatility is worrisome, they said. ''i think we're going to pull back from this,'' said fred kobrick, a veteran money manager who invests almost $2 billion. ''people are doing this because they're afraid of missing the upside, not because they see undervalued companies.'' indeed, the weekend's warnings that individual investors might be fleeing stocks have proven ludicrously wrong so far. since monday afternoon, investors have bought stocks fiercely, especially in the technology sector, sending bellwethers like cisco systems and intel up 15 percent or more. that is nearly a complete reversal of last week, when investors sent the nasdaq composite index down 25 percent, including nearly 10 percent on friday alone, on fears that technology stocks were overpriced and higher interest rates would slow earnings growth. christine callies, chief united states market strategist for credit suisse first boston, warned against reading

Article 3 - for clues to u.s. stocks, look at greek bonds
and the ups and downs of the greek crisis have provided the impetus for the risk-on, risk-off trading that has dominated financial markets worldwide. quite often these days, the tone on wall street has been set by the frantic efforts to stave off a financial calamity in europe. the uncertainty has been buffeting the american economy as well, as ben s. bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, said last week. “most notably,” mr. bernanke said, “concerns about european fiscal and banking issues have contributed to strains in global financial markets, which are likely to have adverse effects on confidence and growth.” he added that the fed remained ready to intervene further, if needed. despite these problems, mr. bernstein says, investors should be focusing on the handsome profits that american companies are churning out. but he says it’s understandable that people are fixated on the immediate crisis in greece. so he turns to the greek bond as a back-of-the-envelope indicator. what’s his logic? as he sees it, the sinking market price for those bonds tells him that the greek bailout deal, if it holds together, will be extremely “bullish short term for banks,” and therefore “bullish short term for the stock market in the united states, too.” but in the slightly longer term, however, it will also be bearish for both. why? a “voluntary” 50 percent haircut — or discount — for those bonds

Article 5 - stocks are responding to washington. that’s bad news for markets.
wall street is finally waking up to the reality in washington. the standard & poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent on wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called trump rally since last year’s election. stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift. the promise of relaxed regulation, corporate tax cuts, and investment in america’s crumbling roads and bridges under president trump and a republican congress has excited investors for most of the past six months. clinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals, not least the daily dysfunction in the nation’s capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade. there were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling united states health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the trump campaign and russian meddling into the election.

even though most of the people buying ether and bitcoin are individual investors, the gains that both have experienced have taken what was until very recently a quirky fringe experiment into the realm of big money. the combined value of all ether and bitcoin is now worth more than the market value of paypal and is approaching the size of goldman sachs. investors buying ether are placing a bet that people will want to use the ethereum network’s computing capabilities and will need the currency to do so. but that is far from a sure thing. and real-world use of the network is still scant. bitcoin, on the other hand, has made inroads into mainstream commerce, with companies like overstock.com and expedia accepting bitcoin for purchases, along with the black-market operators who use the currency. advertisement continue reading the main story the fact that there are fewer real-world uses for ethereum has many market experts expecting a crash similar to the ones that have followed previous run-ups in the price of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. even during recent pullbacks, though, the value of ether has generally continued to gain on bitcoin in relative terms. ethereum was launched in the middle of 2015 by a 21-year-old college dropout, vitalik buterin, who was born in russia and raised in canada. he now lists his residence, jokingly, as cathay pacific airlines because of his travel schedule. the ether he holds has made him a millionaire many times over, but he has generally avoided commenting on the price

Title: trend analyst on stocks: “if the dow drops below 15,000… i would suggest people start buying food & ammo”
Content: stock markets across the world are starting to crack. wednesday night europe was heavily in the red with drops in excess of 3% in some market exchanges. and, as soon as the bell rang thursday morning on the east coast, u.s. stocks continued the global decline. though the federal reserve released a report today indicating that the u.s. economy was on pace to grow moderately, investors were having none of it. after topping 17,000 for all time highs just a few weeks ago, stocks have tumbled over 1,000 points through thursday. daniel ameduri of future money trends alerted subscribers several months ago to brace for a correction of at least 10% this fall, and perhaps even worse. that prediction, echoed by many contrarian financial analysts and economists, is now coming to pass. this thing went up on air, decade low trading volume, no public participation, and unprecedented company buybacks. the rally since 2009 was stunning considering the fundamentals. the meltdown will be shocking. source: future money trends there is panic on wall street. and while very few people are talking about, it is very likely that what’s fueling the sell-off is a global panic surrounding the possibility of a widespread ebola congtagion. with americans growing increasingly concerned about the government’s inability to control the spread of the deadly disease in the lead up to the holiday shopping season, global investors may see the writing on the wall. if ebola cannot be contained, then people will likely opt to stay home this year instead of joining massive crowds in closed quarters during key shopping days like black friday. fundamentally, the u.s. is in trouble as noted by these 12 charts which show the permanent damage that has been done to the u.s. economy. as well, numerous ominous signals began flashing warning signs in recent weeks. many of them had not be seen since prior to the crash of 2008. now, without any clearly defined plan or protocols to control the ebola contagion, the obama administration may have just triggered the next big crash. according to ameduri, if the market breaks under the technical levels in the area of 15,000 points on the dow jones, we could be in for a serious crash. “below 15,500 on the dow and it could get ugly,” he says. “below 15,000 and all bets are off.” stock traders and computer trading algorithms closely follow technical movements ofstocks. the automatic trading systems, specifically, depend on benchmarks and “stops” to determine when to buy or sell. in may of 2010 stocks dropped nearly 1,000 points within a few hours after automatic trading systems initiated a massive sell-off as technical barriers were broken because of what the government eventually claimed was a “fat finger” trading mistake by a single individual. while it’s impossible to predict if we are nearing a breaking point in financial markets,in vestors around the world are

Market Volatility Reigns as Trump's Victory Sparks Global Uncertainty

The recent US presidential election has sent shockwaves through global markets, with investors scrambling to adjust their portfolios in response to the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's presidency. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted on Wednesday, marking its largest single-day decline since 2008.

Analysts point to a risk-off trade as investors seek safer assets, such as bonds and gold, amid concerns over Trump's policies and potential impact on global markets. The prospect of higher interest rates and trade tensions has also contributed to the volatility.

In contrast, some sectors are bucking the trend, with technology stocks showing resilience despite concerns about their valuations. However, experts warn that this rally may not last, citing the market's high volatility as a worrisome sign.

Meanwhile, investors are taking cues from other markets, such as Greece, where the bailout deal has sparked concerns over its impact on global financial markets. The Greek bond market is seen as a bellwether for the US economy, with some analysts predicting that a successful bailout will be bullish for stocks in the short term but bearish in the long term.

As investors navigate this uncertain landscape, they are also keeping an eye on other emerging trends, such as the rise of digital currencies like ether and bitcoin. However, experts caution that these assets are highly speculative and may be due for a correction.

With markets still reeling from the election news, investors are advised to remain cautious and monitor developments closely

Market Sentiment Shifts as Global Tensions Rise

The recent market fluctuations have been attributed to a combination of factors, including global economic uncertainty and rising tensions between major world powers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has experienced significant declines in recent days, with Wednesday's 138-point drop marking the largest single-day decline since September.

Analysts point to a ""leadership reversal"" in the market, where stocks setting new 52-week lows outnumber those hitting new highs. This shift is seen as a sign of deteriorating market internals and a potential warning sign for investors.

The technology sector has also been under pressure, with major players such as Apple Inc., Oracle Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation experiencing significant declines. The decline is attributed to the strengthening US dollar and falling euro, which have led to a decrease in investor confidence.

Meanwhile, protests against Wall Street greed have gained momentum globally, with demonstrators in cities across Europe and the United States calling for greater economic equality. The Occupy Wall Street movement has seen widespread participation, with thousands of people gathering in Times Square on October 15th.

In the financial sector, concerns over the US government shutdown have led to a decrease in investor confidence, although markets remain relatively stable. Analysts predict that the situation may lead to increased action by the Federal Reserve and potentially impact global markets.

As investors navigate these complex market dynamics, it is essential to stay informed about the latest developments and adjust strategies accordingly. With tensions rising globally, it is crucial to be prepared for potential market fluctuations

The language used is straightforward and objective, indicating a reliable news source. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE takes a more sensationalized approach, focusing on broader trends and unregulated land deals without directly addressing the specific issue of beach privatization in San Antonio.","""Hidden Land Deals and Unseen Consequences: A Look at the Unregulated World of Property Development""

A recent surge in high-stakes land deals has left many wondering about the true cost of progress. In one instance, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist is seeking $30 million from the state of California to restore public access to a beloved beach, sparking outrage over the sale of public lands.

Meanwhile, in Florida, the Mormon Church has purchased hundreds of thousands of acres across three counties for over half a billion dollars, raising concerns about the impact on local communities. The church's plans for ""master-planned communities"" have been met with skepticism, as experts warn that such developments can lead to gentrification and displacement.

In other parts of the country, residents are facing unexpected changes in their neighborhoods. A couple in rural England discovered that a 700-home estate was being built around their farm cottage without their consultation, highlighting the need for greater transparency in planning processes.

The issue is not limited to individual cases; a broader trend is emerging as governments and corporations seek to prioritize profit over people's needs. In Nova Scotia, Canada, a provincial housing strategy has been criticized for failing to address the needs of low-income households, who are often forced to pay exorbitant rents or face homelessness.

As the world grapples with issues of gentrification, displacement, and environmental degradation, it is clear that the unregulated world of property development poses significant challenges. As one expert noted, ""when property rights are weak, people tend to take care of their property... but when they're not, we see graffiti, litter, broken windows, and often, rats.""","San Antonio Beach Privatization Debate Heats Up

A contentious issue has been brewing in San Antonio, with many questioning whether shorefront homeowners should be required to open their land to the public. The debate centers around beach privatization, a topic that sparks intense discussion among residents and visitors alike.

Proponents of beach privatization argue that it allows homeowners to maintain control over their property and set boundaries for access. However, opponents claim that this approach can limit public access to beaches, which are often considered essential resources for recreation and relaxation.

Recent developments have brought the issue to a head, with several high-profile leases sparking controversy among stakeholders. The leases in question grant access to specific areas of the beach, but their terms and conditions remain shrouded in mystery.

As the debate rages on, San Antonio residents are being forced to confront the complexities of beach privatization. While some argue that it is essential for maintaining property values and ensuring public safety, others contend that it can lead to unequal access and exacerbate existing social inequalities.

The issue has also raised questions about the role of government in regulating private land use. Should shorefront homeowners be allowed to restrict access to their properties, or should public interests take precedence?

As the debate continues, one thing is clear: San Antonio's beach privatization issue will not be resolved easily. With passions running high and opinions sharply divided, it remains to be seen how this contentious issue will ultimately play out.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 4 - provincial housing strategy could do more for people on low incomes
(before it's news) nova scotia needs more affordable housing. roughly 43,000 households (12 per cent of all households in nova scotia) are in housing crisis mode, meaning that shelter is either inadequate, unsuitable or unaffordable. the recently released provincial housing strategy describes how supporting home ownership and creating mixed communities through alliances with private developers and non-profit organizations will address this shortage of affordable housing. pamela harrison, although supportive of the strategy in general, fears that the document does not sufficiently address the needs of people who receive social assistance or struggle to make ends meet on very low incomes. harrison is the provincial coordinator for the transition house association of nova scotia. she is also one of the main authors of those sections in the canadian centre for policy alternatives alternative budget that deal with housing issues. “all of us have different capabilities, different ways that we contribute to communities, but all of us have the right to be respected. if people have limited ability to contribute that doesn’t mean that they should be sacrificed in terms of housing and safety,” says harrison. there is a general consensus that anybody who spends more than 30 percent of their income on housing is spending more than they can afford. yet, harrison argues, for people on social assistance, average market rents can easily consume as much as 80 percent of their income. even subsidized “affordable” apartments often remain out of reach for them. what this shows, harrison argues,

after losing to hillary clinton, bernie sanders is back to his day job as a us senator for vermont. sanders campaigned against the 1%, promising to bring america closer to his democratic socialist ideal and to take corporations and rich people down a peg or two. but now that his campaign is over, he’s picking up a sweet new pad. according to seven days, a news publication in vermont, the democratic socialist from vermont shelled out 600 grand for a lake house. the burlington resident last week plopped down nearly $$600,000 on a camp in north hero. sanders’ new waterfront crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of lake champlain beachfront on the east side of the island — facing vermont, not new york. the bern will keep his home in burlington and use the new camp seasonally. “we’ve traveled up to the islands many times over the years — almost always on day trips,” sanders’ wife, jane o’meara sanders, told seven days in a written statement. “we’ve been impressed with the north hero community, eaten at the north hero house and shore acres and have suggested them to friends who were looking for a beautiful place to stay or have dinner. st. anne’s shrine in isle la motte is my favorite church and it is nearby.” some quotes from twitter include: “millionaires! bernie sanders buys “camp” on vt island

Article 10 - new york airbnb law hurting b&bs
new york airbnb law hurting b&bs (before it's news) matthew feeney the campaign against airbnb in new york city has claimed some surprising collateral damage – actual b&bs. according to mary white of bnb finder, half of all the b&bs in the city have closed down since legislation in 2011 aimed at limiting airbnb abuses came into effect. the statewide law prohibits building owners renting rooms in residential buildings and apartments for less than 30 days. the law may have been aimed at preventing apartment buildings from being turned into illegal hotels, but it has resulted in fines being issued to b&b owners. the owner of one of new york city’s b&bs launched an advocacy group in 2011 that lobbies for changes in legislation but does not list its members. given the legislation affecting b&bs it is understandable that bnb owners would be hesitant to increase their exposure. a crain’s new york business article on the decline of b&bs in new york city quotes the owner of a brooklyn inn, who limits the amount of attention her business receives online in order to avoid city investigators: most people don’t even know b&bs exist in the city. now many innkeepers are keeping a lower profile, hoping not to attract the city’s attention. the owner of a european-style inn in brooklyn, who did not want to be identified, said she limits her online exposure by not listing her property with travel sites like expedia

""Hidden Land Deals and Unseen Consequences: A Look at the Unregulated World of Property Development""

A recent surge in high-stakes land deals has left many wondering about the true cost of progress. In one instance, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist is seeking $30 million from the state of California to restore public access to a beloved beach, sparking outrage over the sale of public lands.

Meanwhile, in Florida, the Mormon Church has purchased hundreds of thousands of acres across three counties for over half a billion dollars, raising concerns about the impact on local communities. The church's plans for ""master-planned communities"" have been met with skepticism, as experts warn that such developments can lead to gentrification and displacement.

In other parts of the country, residents are facing unexpected changes in their neighborhoods. A couple in rural England discovered that a 700-home estate was being built around their farm cottage without their consultation, highlighting the need for greater transparency in planning processes.

The issue is not limited to individual cases; a broader trend is emerging as governments and corporations seek to prioritize profit over people's needs. In Nova Scotia, Canada, a provincial housing strategy has been criticized for failing to address the needs of low-income households, who are often forced to pay exorbitant rents or face homelessness.

As the world grapples with issues of gentrification, displacement, and environmental degradation, it is clear that the unregulated world of property development poses significant challenges. As one expert noted, ""when property

San Antonio Beach Privatization Debate Heats Up

A contentious issue has been brewing in San Antonio, with many questioning whether shorefront homeowners should be required to open their land to the public. The debate centers around beach privatization, a topic that sparks intense discussion among residents and visitors alike.

Proponents of beach privatization argue that it allows homeowners to maintain control over their property and set boundaries for access. However, opponents claim that this approach can limit public access to beaches, which are often considered essential resources for recreation and relaxation.

Recent developments have brought the issue to a head, with several high-profile leases sparking controversy among stakeholders. The leases in question grant access to specific areas of the beach, but their terms and conditions remain shrouded in mystery.

As the debate rages on, San Antonio residents are being forced to confront the complexities of beach privatization. While some argue that it is essential for maintaining property values and ensuring public safety, others contend that it can lead to unequal access and exacerbate existing social inequalities.

The issue has also raised questions about the role of government in regulating private land use. Should shorefront homeowners be allowed to restrict access to their properties, or should public interests take precedence?

As the debate continues, one thing is clear: San Antonio's beach privatization issue will not be resolved easily. With passions running high and opinions sharply divided, it remains to be seen how this contentious issue will ultimately play out.

The language used is neutral and informative, without any sensational or biased tone.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Libya's Future: A Nation in Turmoil"" contains several red flags that indicate its fictional nature. Firstly, the article makes unsubstantiated claims about Western powers' involvement in Libya's downfall and implies a conspiracy theory. Additionally, the article includes speculative statements about human trafficking and smuggling, which are not supported by credible sources.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE ""Global Leaders Address Complex Issues"" is more similar to the original article ""celebrating the basic human decency of a lying stooge"" in style and content because it also presents factual information and raises nuanced questions about global issues. The language used is neutral, and the tone is informative rather than sensational or biased.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more confident in its classification because it provides credible sources and evidence to support its claims, whereas the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE relies on unsubstantiated claims and speculation.","Libya's Future: A Nation in Turmoil

The future of Libya remains uncertain, with the country struggling to rebuild after years of conflict. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 was initially hailed as a success, but the subsequent power vacuum has led to chaos and instability.

Western powers, including the US and UK, have been accused of complicity in Libya's downfall. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair was forced to confirm that he did not support Al-Qaeda during phone calls with Gaddafi, highlighting the complexity of Western involvement in the region.

The Libyan conflict has also had far-reaching consequences for other countries, including Syria and Afghanistan. The US economy is heavily reliant on military spending, which has been a major driver of instability in the Middle East.

Human trafficking and smuggling have become major issues in Libya, with thousands of people being sold at auction. The country's role in the slave trade has been widely condemned, and experts point to the 2011 Arab Spring uprising as a key factor in the current crisis.

The involvement of Western powers in the region has also led to criticism from human rights groups. The CIA and ISI agencies have been accused of being immune to institutional reflection and reform, with some arguing that their actions have contributed to the destabilization of countries such as Libya and Syria.

As the international community grapples with the challenges facing Libya, it remains to be seen whether the country can rebuild and stabilize in the long term. One thing is clear: the future of Libya will not be determined by Western powers alone, but rather by the actions of its own people and leaders.","Global Leaders Address Complex Issues

In recent months, world leaders have been grappling with pressing global issues. In Libya, a brutal crackdown by the regime led to international condemnation and calls for accountability. The United States, along with other nations, took swift action to freeze assets, impose sanctions, and enable those responsible to be held accountable.

Meanwhile, in Africa, concerns about Western aid have sparked debate. Some argue that aid has perpetuated poverty rather than alleviated it, while others point out the need for more nuanced approaches to development. The issue is particularly relevant when considering the economic disparities between countries like China and those in sub-Saharan Africa.

In the United States, a new administration is taking shape, with key figures emerging as leaders. Hillary Clinton has spoken about the importance of bipartisanship and multilateralism, while her counterpart, Joe Biden, has emphasized his commitment to cooperation and national security.

The Middle East remains a hotbed of conflict, with Syria's civil war continuing to claim thousands of lives. The Arab Spring, which brought hope for greater moderation and participation, has instead seen disturbing events unfold in nation after nation.

In other parts of the world, humanitarian crises are unfolding. In Jordan, a Syrian refugee camp is struggling to cope with the influx of people fleeing conflict. Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to revitalize the economy and rebuild after the devastating effects of Ebola.

As global leaders navigate these complex issues, they must balance competing priorities and find innovative solutions to pressing problems. The need for cooperation, sacrifice, and unity has never been more pressing.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - libya's future: much less certain than death and taxes
libya's future: much less certain than death and taxes % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) moammar gaddafi, the libyan leader desperate to maintain the little power he has left, was said to have arrived in algeria in a convoy of mercedes. he must have done so after finding the personal jet of robert mugabe and zimbabwe to not be luxurious enough for his flamboyant self. or he’s in the sahara desert with his adopted daughter who arose from the dead 25 years after her death. or he’s floating around in space. all of this confusion, chaos, and senseless chatter about gaddafi’s whereabouts mimics much of libya’s big picture: the future is constantly changing, subject to the ever blowing saharan winds, and will most likely be far from a democratic dreamland. fareed zakaria, a member of the foreign policy elite, has heralded the libyan intervention (not a war, of course) as “a new era in u.s. foreign policy.” most of his praise was directed at the multilateral effort of the un and the legitimacy that nearby arab countries provided. he ended his propaganda piece with a self addressed question and answer: the question before libya was: could such interventions be successful while keeping costs under control – both human and financial. today’s answer is: yes. this same short sighted nonsense was said about ir

Article 2 - deceivers: western complicity in tragic death of drowned syrian boy
deceivers: western complicity in tragic death of drowned syrian boy (before it's news) stuart j. hooper 21st century wire one has to begin to wonder what planet david cameron actually inhabits. watch a video of this report here: british pm david cameron has said he was “deeply moved” by the viral images of a dead syrian boy who washed up on turkish shores this week. he was one of thousands attempting to flee their war torn homeland for safer shores. cameron added that “britain is a moral nation and we will fulfil our moral responsibilities”, believing that he personally “sent the royal navy to the mediterranean and saved thousands of lives”. delusion of this magnitude should be a cause for concern, and perhaps even medical treatment at a psychiatric facility. cameron’s ‘moral nation’ is where one million people are having to rely on food banks to feed their families, shortages of nurses are threatening lives in hospitals, austerity cuts are forcing people to commit suicide, university tuition fees were tripled dooming an entire generation into a debt black hole, and, executives from banks engaged in flagrant criminal activity are appointed to positions in the government. not such a ‘moral nation’ after all then. libya – destroyed by nato.

(before it's news) one takeaway from trump’s inauguration speech: gangs by jon rappoport i could list 10 interesting things trump said yesterday. and of course, words aren’t actions. yet. but here is one remark you’re not going to get, and never did get, from any recent president: “mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities…and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. this american carnage stops right here and stops right now.” to which rachel maddow (msnbc) replied: “it was militant and it was dark. the crime, the gangs, the drugs, this ‘american carnage,’ disrepair, decay. you can’t imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that.” she’s right, because the outgoing president never did anything to stop the carnage. if she thinks trump’s language was too militant, she should try talking to mothers who live in those inner cities, who are trapped and held hostage by gangs, who want a nation of laws, and can’t find a way to live safely with their children by eating obamas’s high-flying empty rhetoric. obama somehow managed to spend eight years in the white house and never mention, with any significance, gangs. eight years…and nothing. yet

Article 5 - wikileaks turns their attention to benghazi, immediately reveals hillary was…
if there is one thing hillary clinton is good for, it is false bravado. during her congressional grilling session regarding benghazi, she famously retorted in anger, “what difference, at this point, does it make?” privately, however, she weaves a different tale. the wikileaks dump of those expensive, once-private speeches reveals that clinton’s “biggest regret” and that libya’s institutions were totally “destroyed” per breitbart.com. in a nutshell, clinton and obama’s nation-building exercise did not work. hillary clinton and barack obama were completely wrong about what would happen after they toppled libyan dictator moammar qaddafi, and there was a bit of “hindsight is 20/20” in her 2013 speech. she said in that speech that she fully understood how the repercussions played out, but as you and i both know she failed to heed the warnings regarding ambassador chris stevens and those who died with him. during a cisco speech in august 2014 clinton expanded on her comments, and discussed how inadequate the security situation was in that area at the time. in what could definitely be termed a “well, duh!” moment for the rest of us, she was literally speaking about the venture as if someone else had been secretary of state during the time. this is not the most galling instance within this whole exchange, however. remember, this is the same

david swanson: support killing people or lose your job (before it's news) image by getty images via @daylife grant lawrence–bodhi thunder by david swanson war is a crime.org “ban the bombers are afraid of a fight “peace hurts business and that ain’t right “how do i know? i read it in the daily news” –tom paxton pbs (the p stands for “pure” i think) is concerned that if the u.s. government stops funding the war in afghanistan, the u.s. economy will crash: “an executive at a small defense contractor recently joked to me, ‘afghanistan is our business plan.’ i asked him what he would do if the war ended. he stared at me for a moment and said, ‘well, then i hope we invade libya.’” i’ve passed this story around on facebook and twitter to a general response of complete bewilderment. it seems that not many people are aware that the u.s. economy depends heavily on massive government investment. the investment is through the military, and through the militaries of foreign governments running the full gamut from quasi-democracy to total dictatorship. making the materials of war is what we do; it is our major industry, and it is funded with about half of our income taxes every year. this helps explain why president obama was willing to de-escalate in iraq only as he escalated in afghanistan

Article 7 - disturbing video of humans being sold proves us foreign policy has made slavery mainstream again
disturbing video of humans being sold proves us foreign policy has made slavery mainstream again headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! last week, cnn published a report detailing the slave trade occurring in present-day libya. while it’s easy to write off cnn as “fake news”, as the sitting president of the united states so infamously proclaims, a closer look into the phenomena of humans being sold at auction in the year 2017 confirms the unthinkable — slavery is mainstream again. however, cnn is not giving you the reason why people are being traded for cash, bought and sold at auction, for as little as $400. according to the new york times, the cause of the travesty goes all the way back to the united states’ backing of the so-called “arab spring,” an uprising which eventually led to the overthrow of libya’s leader, muammar gaddafi. since the arab spring uprising of 2011 ended the brutal rule of col. muammar el-qaddafi, libya’s coast has became a hub for human trafficking and smuggling. that has fueled the illegal migration crisis that europe has been scrambling to contain since 2014. however, the destabilized hub for slavery and terrorism that we see today is not just from the arab spring. the obama administration, led by then-secretary of state, hillary r. clinton, orchestrated qaddafi’s overthrow. secretary clinton even laughed at qaddafi’s

Article 8 - boxing with reality: the cia and isi are immune from institutional reflection and reform
boxing with reality: the cia and isi are immune from institutional reflection and reform (before it's news) two of the biggest stories to close out the year were the cia torture report and the peshawar school attack in pakistan. the secret intelligence agencies of both countries came out looking worse than ever. the cia and isi want nothing more this new year than for these tragedies and controversies to go away. the focus on both of these stories is fitting because it was a big year for national security news and terrorism related issues. there were lone wolf attacks by mentally ill isis sympathizers in ottawa and sydney, though the attacks were poorly thought out and did little damage, thankfully. imagine the scale of destruction if isis attracted criminal geniuses instead of buffoons. both canada and australia have shown enthusiastic support for overthrowing secular regimes in libya and syria without thinking out the consequences for the well-being of these fragile and tribal countries. it was not surprising that the attacker of the parliament in ottawa was of libyan background. it should be remembered that canada played a lead public role in toppling the gaddafi regime and bringing radical sunni militias to power in that country. these terrorist militias have absolutely wrecked the place, to the point that libya is now being considered a failed state by the most mainstream of mainstream analysts. of course, the retarded and amateurish attacks in ottawa and sydney cannot be condoned on any level whatsoever, but history

Article 1 - obama’s remarks on libya
faced with this opposition, gaddafi began attacking his people. as president, my immediate concern was the safety of our citizens, so we evacuated our embassy and all americans who sought our assistance. we then took a series of swift steps in a matter of days to answer gaddafi's aggression. we froze more than $33 billion of the gaddafi regime's assets. joining with other nations at the united nations security council, we broadened our sanctions, imposed an arms embargo, and enabled gaddafi and those around him to be held accountable for their crimes. i made it clear that gaddafi had lost the confidence of his people and the legitimacy to lead, and i said that he needed to step down from power. in the face of the world's condemnation, gaddafi chose to escalate his attacks, launching a military campaign against the libyan people. innocent people were targeted for killing. hospitals and ambulances were attacked. journalists were arrested, sexually assaulted, and killed. supplies of food and fuel were choked off. the water for hundreds of thousands of people in misratah was shut off. cities and towns were shelled, mosques destroyed, and apartment buildings reduced to rubble. military jets and helicopter gunships were unleashed upon people who had no means to defend themselves against assault from the air. confronted by this brutal repression and a looming humanitarian crisis, i ordered warships into the mediterranean. european allies declared their willingness to commit resources to stop the killing. the libyan

q: as a native of zambia with advanced degrees in public policy and economics from harvard and oxford, you are about to publish an attack on western aid to africa and its recent glamorization by celebrities. ‘‘dead aid,’’ as your book is called, is particularly hard on rock stars. have you met bono? i have, yes, at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, last year. it was at a party to raise money for africans, and there were no africans in the room, except for me. what do you think of him? i’ll make a general comment about this whole dependence on “celebrities.” i object to this situation as it is right now where they have inadvertently or manipulatively become the spokespeople for the african continent. you argue in your book that western aid to africa has not only perpetuated poverty but also worsened it, and you are perhaps the first african to request in book form that all development aid be halted within five years. think about it this way — china has 1.3 billion people, only 300 million of whom live like us, if you will, with western living standards. there are a billion chinese who are living in substandard conditions. do you know anybody who feels sorry for china? nobody. maybe that’s because they have so much money that we here in the u.s. are begging the chinese for loans. forty years ago, china was poorer than many african

(laughter.) this is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world and to america in particular, which is to see a — a complete change in the — the — the structure and the — the environment in the middle east. with the arab spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women and — and public life and in economic life in the middle east. but instead we’ve seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events. of course, we see in syria 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there. we see in — in — in libya an attack apparently by — well, i think

Article 5 - pro bono work in haiti
to the editor: i was surprised that your unflattering article about the clinton foundation (“unease at clinton foundation over finances and ambitions,” front page, aug. 14) made reference to my company’s pro bono work in haiti as if it were somehow enabled by the financial consulting firm teneo or was some sort of benefit bestowed upon us as a result of a business relationship with it. nothing could be further from the truth. notwithstanding the immense needs that remain three years after the earthquake that devastated the haitian capital, charitable work in haiti these days has become a fairly lonely business. i know this because i was in haiti earlier this month. most aid agencies have cut and run with a severe case of donor fatigue, but not the clintons or the clinton foundation. we are immensely proud of the work that we have done and continue to do in haiti in partnership with the clinton foundation. david crane chief executive, nrg energy princeton, n.j., aug. 14, 2013

Article 6 - city room
he has the keys the cabbies need as the man who hands out the keys to 165 yellow cabs for a fleet company on west 44th street, enrique sandoval has an interesting take on the new york city cab scene. mr. sandoval gives the keys to drivers renting from the company, style management, for 12-hour shifts. ''twelve hours is a long time to drive, especially in manhattan, and when the drivers finish, they're too tired to find a parking spot,'' he said this week, keys spread out on the trunk of a cab on 44th near 10th avenue. parking here is scarce, so as the cabs cycle in and out of use, mr. sandoval and a partner jockey them around -- even double parking or leaving them on a sidewalk -- until they're up for duty again. cabbies pulled up, handed keys to mr. sandoval and slouched homeward. drivers beginning their shifts were much more chipper. they shouted out the medallion numbers for the cabs they were renting -- 5z29, 9y40 and so on -- and joked with mr. sandoval and tipped him a dollar or two, ''because when they finish, i park the cab for them,'' mr. sandoval said.

""before, even if i was walking, i would not be at ease with so many people jostling,"" said othman, 24, who recalls how tents for newly arriving refugees could not be erected fast enough when he arrived with his family in 2012. where there had been empty desert, a sprawling slum city emerged, with a population of 125,000 at its peak. around half a million people have passed through. shops sprang up offering everything from ice cream to pizzas, mobile phones or wedding gown rentals. prime spots changed hands for thousands of dollars.

Article 8 - yahya jammeh: devout and erratic leader of gambia
banjul (gambia) (afp) – gambian president yahya jammeh seized power in a 1994 coup and has maintained it ever since with a mixture of severity, mysticism and iron-clad self-belief. “no matter what people say about me, i am not moved… i don’t listen to anybody because i know what is important,” he said while depositing his candidacy for this week’s presidential election. governing, he said, “is between me and god almighty.” this deeply devout muslim grew up in the western village of kanilai in 1965, the year that the gambia, a long east-west sliver of land bordered by senegal, gained independence from britain. his excellency sheikh professor alhaji doctor yahya abdul-azziz jemus junkung jammeh naasiru deen joined the army in 1984 — his military title is the only one he has lost. ten years later, jammeh mounted a coup with fellow army officers against dawda jawara, who had ruled the country since independence, pledging to root out corruption and hold elections. after giving up his rank of colonel to allow him to contest elections as a civilian, jammeh swept the vote in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011, following a 2002 constitutional amendment removing presidential term limits. – rights abuses – now

Article 9 - life after the epidemic: reviving sierra leone's post-ebola economy | global development professionals network
ogoo farm in sierra leone’s waterloo district is about to bring in its october rice crop. the farmer is optimistic that it will be a record yield. increasing agricultural productivity is one of the 146 priority initiatives included in the country’s economic recovery plan, also known as the president’s recovery priorities. if all goes well, many farmers will double their production this year. the country spends more than $110m (£89m) annually on importing rice. in 2014, this represented 4.8% of the country’s imports, second to refined petroleum. while sierra leone is still a long way from being self-sufficient in its staple food, initiatives such as providing farmers with improved seed rice and fertiliser are part of an extensive plan to jump-start sierra leone’s agricultural sector. when president koroma launched this 24-month economic recovery plan to address the catastrophic effects of the ebola epidemic and commodities price crash in sierra leone, he was unequivocal about its demands, stating that it would require “a new way of working”, collaboration, sacrifice and unity. mindful of the lessons of the ebola response, which reasserted the need for sierra leone’s sovereignty in its own development, the country’s economic recovery plan is led by sierra leoneans. aligning their support behind it, donors have signalled their approval for the approach, and as the largest single donor, with £240m, the department for

Article 10 - taxes are helping right some of apartheid's old wrongs
the steady rise in revenue has eased, if only slightly, the pressures on a government with far more needs to meet than money to meet them. the freshly dug water wells in rural lands and newly erected homes in urban ghettos are evidence of what has been done, the overcrowded schools and understaffed health clinics of what remains to be done. with a commitment to trimming the budget deficit, which has fallen to just below 3 percent, the government is relying on increased revenue collection to finance a big part of the country's social development needs. not unexpectedly, the newfound zeal has unnerved more than a few taxpayers. the wealthy are finding their assets scrutinized as never before. investigators armed with newly acquired software, for example, are cross-checking individual tax returns with home and car ownership records and turning up lots of people living beyond their declared means. while investigators get more aggressive, policy makers are getting more creative and are transforming the tax code. perhaps the most notable change has been the introduction of a capital gains tax, which has sent many people searching for records they had never before had to worry about keeping. nearly as significant has been the decision to scrap the practice of taxing people only on the income earned in south africa. instead they will be liable for taxes on income earned offshore as well. accountants are finding themselves hard pressed to keep pace with the succession of sweeping changes.

Title: celebrating the basic human decency of a lying stooge
Content: celebrating the basic human decency of a lying stooge % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) must admit we made something of a faux pas with this post from a couple weeks ago, praising the integrity of former liberal leader bob rae. bob has betrayed the trust we had in him with his unfortunate comments about libya that appeared in the globe and mail today. bob did get one thing right; it’s rare for an establishment commentator, especially one who was an enthusiastic cheerleader for the war, to admit that two years after the demise of gaddafi the country is a shambles. but here’s the whopper that floored me; “gaddafi did not invest in people, institutions, or infrastructure.” gaddafi’s people enjoyed free housing, health care, and education. before we liberated them they enjoyed the highest standard of living on the african continent. under gaddafi, tens of thousands of libyans studied abroad at the expense of the state. gaddafi built one of the greatest infrastructure projects of all time, the great man-made river. and notice how bullshit bob bemoans the fact that “aid money is drying up.” how is it possible that gaddafi was able to do all the above without aid money, but now that we’ve liberated them the libyans have become aid dependent? perhaps the key to this mystery is revealed by the note at the end of the article. bob is working with the “national democratic institute.” that is one of a multiplicity of us funded “democracy promoters” busy on the ground to help guide nascent democracies towards the “right” sort of democracy. and only a washington approved democracy will ever be the right sort. source: http://theviewfromfallingdowns.blogspot.com/2013/07/celebrating-basic-human-decency-of.html

Global Leaders Address Complex Issues

In recent months, world leaders have been grappling with pressing global issues. In Libya, a brutal crackdown by the regime led to international condemnation and calls for accountability. The United States, along with other nations, took swift action to freeze assets, impose sanctions, and enable those responsible to be held accountable.

Meanwhile, in Africa, concerns about Western aid have sparked debate. Some argue that aid has perpetuated poverty rather than alleviated it, while others point out the need for more nuanced approaches to development. The issue is particularly relevant when considering the economic disparities between countries like China and those in sub-Saharan Africa.

In the United States, a new administration is taking shape, with key figures emerging as leaders. Hillary Clinton has spoken about the importance of bipartisanship and multilateralism, while her counterpart, Joe Biden, has emphasized his commitment to cooperation and national security.

The Middle East remains a hotbed of conflict, with Syria's civil war continuing to claim thousands of lives. The Arab Spring, which brought hope for greater moderation and participation, has instead seen disturbing events unfold in nation after nation.

In other parts of the world, humanitarian crises are unfolding. In Jordan, a Syrian refugee camp is struggling to cope with the influx of people fleeing conflict. Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to revitalize the economy and rebuild after the devastating effects of Ebola.

As global leaders navigate these complex issues, they must balance competing priorities and find innovative solutions to pressing problems

Libya's Future: A Nation in Turmoil

The future of Libya remains uncertain, with the country struggling to rebuild after years of conflict. The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 was initially hailed as a success, but the subsequent power vacuum has led to chaos and instability.

Western powers, including the US and UK, have been accused of complicity in Libya's downfall. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair was forced to confirm that he did not support Al-Qaeda during phone calls with Gaddafi, highlighting the complexity of Western involvement in the region.

The Libyan conflict has also had far-reaching consequences for other countries, including Syria and Afghanistan. The US economy is heavily reliant on military spending, which has been a major driver of instability in the Middle East.

Human trafficking and smuggling have become major issues in Libya, with thousands of people being sold at auction. The country's role in the slave trade has been widely condemned, and experts point to the 2011 Arab Spring uprising as a key factor in the current crisis.

The involvement of Western powers in the region has also led to criticism from human rights groups. The CIA and ISI agencies have been accused of being immune to institutional reflection and reform, with some arguing that their actions have contributed to the destabilization of countries such as Libya and Syria.

As the international community grapples with the challenges facing Libya, it remains to be seen whether the country can rebuild and stabilize in the long term. One thing is clear: the future of

This article is more similar to the original article in style and content, as it provides factual information about a specific topic (the evolution of New York City's subway system) without any sensational or misleading claims.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""A Glimpse into the Past: Unpacking Modern Trends"" contains several red flags, including:  * A vague and overly broad statement about modern individualism and 1980s pop culture being intertwined * A visit from H.G. Wells to Fayetteville State University, which is not a real event * The mention of documentaries like ""The Age of Stupid"" and ""Extreme Ice,"" which are real but used in a misleading context * A promotional spot for the Spike Scream Awards 2010, which is unrelated to the topic  Overall, while both articles may touch on similar topics, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE contains several inaccuracies and sensational claims that make it less reliable than the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE.","A Glimpse into the Past: Unpacking Modern Trends

In recent years, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged, where modern individualism and 1980s pop culture seem to be intertwined. This connection is not merely coincidental; it's rooted in the fundamental shifts that occurred during the Reagan era. However, this narrative overlooks the complexities of the past, particularly the pre-1980s period.

A visit from H.G. Wells to Fayetteville State University revealed a striking contrast between the apathy and indifference of students towards abortion and the eloi people's childlike nature in his book ""Time Machine."" The eloi lazed about without curiosity or discipline, seemingly oblivious to danger. Similarly, the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences of industrial accidents.

Meanwhile, documentaries like ""The Age of Stupid"" and ""Extreme Ice"" shed light on the pressing issues of climate change and energy consumption. These films use storytelling formats to convey the human impact of our actions, often highlighting the conflicts between individual interests and global limits.

In a more lighthearted vein, Michael J. Fox's promotional spot for the Spike Scream Awards 2010 celebrated the 25th anniversary of ""Back to the Future."" This nostalgic nod serves as a reminder that even in the face of complex issues, we can find solace in familiar narratives and cultural touchstones.

As we navigate the complexities of modern society, it's essential to acknowledge both the progress we've made and the challenges that lie ahead. By examining the past and its connections to the present, we may uncover new insights into the world we live in today.","New York City's Subway System Evolves

As the city's population continues to grow, so does its reliance on public transportation. The subway system, once a peaceful oasis for commuters, has become a hub of activity with passengers using their phones to navigate and socialize during their daily rides.

However, not all New Yorkers are familiar with this new dynamic. For some, it can be overwhelming, while others have grown accustomed to the chatter and noise. ""It's like elevator music,"" said one commuter, who wished to remain anonymous.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the city, parents are working to help their children navigate the complex college application process. Organizations like Let's Get Ready provide free resources and support to low-income teenagers, helping them prepare for standardized tests and interviews.

In contrast, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) has undergone significant changes over the years. From its humble beginnings as a freight train system to its current status as a commuter rail line, the LIRR has adapted to the needs of its passengers.

The MTA's subway map has also undergone several redesigns in recent years, with the latest update featuring a more modern and user-friendly design. The map is now available online and in print, making it easier for commuters to plan their routes.

As New York City continues to grow and evolve, its transportation systems must adapt to meet the needs of its residents. From the subway system's changing dynamics to the college application process, there are many stories being written about this great city.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

h. g. wells visits fayetteville state university (before it's news) by jacqueline hawkins fayetteville state university, a historically black institution, was a very calm school. while there was definitely a good response in some that you can read about here, many students were quite indifferent. there were no protesters. no one stopped by to cuss anyone out. while there were students opposed to the pictures and message they were the minority. a girl passed out popsicles to her friends and fraternities step-danced for their peers. samantha linneman of cbr maryland noted: the most surprising thing for our entire team was the total apathy and indifference of the majority of students. many students merely sat around fellowshipping or stood talking with friends, seemingly oblivious to the true horror and tragedy of abortion glaring right in front of them. it seemed that many students were totally indifferent about the deadly toll abortion has on their community. it was reminiscent of the eloi people in the book, time machine by h.g. wells. the eloi were childlike humans who lazed about without curiosity or discipline. they didn’t work and their society had no need for intellect or strength to survive. they lounged about in futuristic dilapidated buildings while the predatory morlocks attacked and ate them at night. despite this danger…they did nothing. it almost seemed that some of the students nonchalantly accepted the abortion of the entire african american race because it was

Article 3 - the age of stupid, again
the age of stupid, again (before it's news) we all have our favorite documentaries related to energy and climate issues. one of mine is extreme ice, which i love nearly as much for the visceral impact of the images as i do for the information content. another “must see and must force friends and family to watch” documentary, but of a very different sort, is the age of stupid, now available in a two-dvd special edition. the age of stupid uses a familiar storytelling format — it’s a look back from the year 2055 on all the things we did wrong between the years 2000 and 2055. that examination focuses on very specific scenarios — a man starting an airline in india, a tour guide in the french alps who’s personally seen the retreat of glaciers, a british wind farm developer struggling to overcome the incredible myopia and opposition to wind turbines seen in many countries, and more. these stories are all compelling by themselves, as they put human faces and interests and motivations and, ultimately, failings, on all these facets of what we do. i can’t think of another documentary that so clearly relates, without resorting to a pedantic style, the raw shearing effect of individual interests coming into conflict with our global limits. a critical part of this documentary is the one fictional character, played brilliantly by pete postlethwaite. we see him via a view from inside his touch-screen monitor as he reviews the video clips that

“i wish i had more nathalys,” ms. diggs said. at newton north, nathaly was surprised to see how many parents help their children game the college application process. nathaly’s father, a cabdriver, and her mother, a preschool teacher, knew how to start a life here after moving from colombia 20 years ago, how to raise three children and how to buy a home, but they did not know much about sat prep. so nathaly found a free program that helps low-income teenagers throughout the northeast work the system too, called let’s get ready. students are given help filling out college applications, writing essays, practicing interviews and preparing for the sat. they are also required to write an essay explaining why they want to participate in let’s get ready. sitting at her kitchen table, nathaly first wrote an outline in longhand. she typed it on her laptop, reworked it for a couple of hours and then let it sit a day to make sure it still sounded good. “the gap between the sats/acts really bothers me because i know that many of my friends of color could do so much better if they could afford classes or a coach,” she wrote. “i would fully take advantage of the extra knowledge those classes will provide. i will willingly show what i know and what i don’t know. my personality is very outgoing and friendly which is something i want to share with the program. i don

the l.i.r.r. of that era ran freight trains with cabooses and hauled potatoes from farms on the daily spud express. on the commuter trains, special parlor cars — executive lounges on wheels — were cooled with ice. smokers had free rein in alternating cars. only men worked on the crews. discounted “ladies day” tickets were honored for city visits on wednesdays. the metropolitan transportation authority did not yet exist. “we were part of the old pennsylvania railroad, and we were in bankruptcy,” mr. dermody said. in 1958, l.i.r.r. fares went up 5.9 percent to help finance a 12-cent hourly raise for the workers. it was the ninth fare increase in 11 years, and some irate riders vowed to form carpools. mr. dermody was a mere lad of 17. the herald tribune, the journal-american and the long island press were among the papers commuters read. stereo records were introduced. alaska became a state. elvis joined the army. harvard tuition was $1,250; jeans were $3.75. the railroad’s 701-mile layout is much the same today, but little else about the system has endured, according to david morrison, founder of the long island rail road historical society. for instance, that monthly pass from massapequa now costs $203. when mr. dermody started, the tracks were punct

Article 8 - paths of transit: once forgotten, bound for duty; sealed tunnels unearthed for rail system in newark
''it's back to the future,'' jeffrey warsh, the executive director of new jersey transit, said this afternoon as he led reporters through the warren of dank tunnels, some of them dominated by the shapes of antique rail cars that have not moved in decades. to mr. warsh, the abandoned tunnels are a sorry reminder of how another generation of planners trashed a viable transit system. ''it's a shame that all of the nation's cities will collectively spend trillions of dollars putting back what was once there,'' he said. as new jersey's largest city, and at one time its wealthiest, newark had a trolley system second only to chicago's. while most trolley cars shuttled along on street-level tracks, they sank below ground as they approached the congested city center. these subterranean lines were largely built on the bed of the defunct morris canal, which was drained in the 1920's. trolley cars from the oranges, jersey city, bound brook and places as distant as trenton poured into a downtown terminal that was owned by public service coordinated transport, the predecessor of new jersey's power company, pse&g. two levels of platforms were lined with shops; above, the terminal was topped by an 11-story office building. in 1917, a year after the terminal opened, more than 50,000 people a day were passing through its turnstiles. but the terminal was not long for

A Glimpse into the Past: Unpacking Modern Trends

In recent years, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged, where modern individualism and 1980s pop culture seem to be intertwined. This connection is not merely coincidental; it's rooted in the fundamental shifts that occurred during the Reagan era. However, this narrative overlooks the complexities of the past, particularly the pre-1980s period.

A visit from H.G. Wells to Fayetteville State University revealed a striking contrast between the apathy and indifference of students towards abortion and the eloi people's childlike nature in his book ""Time Machine."" The eloi lazed about without curiosity or discipline, seemingly oblivious to danger. Similarly, the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences of industrial accidents.

Meanwhile, documentaries like ""The Age of Stupid"" and ""Extreme Ice"" shed light on the pressing issues of climate change and energy consumption. These films use storytelling formats to convey the human impact of our actions, often highlighting the conflicts between individual interests and global limits.

In a more lighthearted vein, Michael J. Fox's promotional spot for the Spike Scream Awards 2010 celebrated the 25th anniversary of ""Back to the Future."" This nostalgic nod serves as a reminder that even in the face of complex issues, we can find solace in familiar narratives and cultural touchstones.

New York City's Subway System Evolves

As the city's population continues to grow, so does its reliance on public transportation. The subway system, once a peaceful oasis for commuters, has become a hub of activity with passengers using their phones to navigate and socialize during their daily rides.

However, not all New Yorkers are familiar with this new dynamic. For some, it can be overwhelming, while others have grown accustomed to the chatter and noise. ""It's like elevator music,"" said one commuter, who wished to remain anonymous.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the city, parents are working to help their children navigate the complex college application process. Organizations like Let's Get Ready provide free resources and support to low-income teenagers, helping them prepare for standardized tests and interviews.

In contrast, the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) has undergone significant changes over the years. From its humble beginnings as a freight train system to its current status as a commuter rail line, the LIRR has adapted to the needs of its passengers.

The MTA's subway map has also undergone several redesigns in recent years, with the latest update featuring a more modern and user-friendly design. The map is now available online and in print, making it easier for commuters to plan their routes.

As New York City continues to grow and evolve, its transportation systems must adapt to meet the needs of its residents. From the subway system's changing dynamics to the college application process, there are many stories being written about this great

The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE also includes unrelated topics, such as farting in public, which is not mentioned in the given article. Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides a more accurate representation of the topic and its current state.","""Smoke-Free Zones: A Changing Landscape""

In the past, cigarettes were a ubiquitous part of college life, with students often smoking in public places without a second thought. However, as the health risks associated with tobacco use became more widely understood, regulations began to tighten. Today, many colleges and universities have banned smoking on campus, citing concerns for student health and safety.

But the trend towards smoke-free zones extends beyond academia. In recent years, cities and towns across the US have implemented strict anti-smoking laws, including bans on smoking in public places and restaurants. The rise of e-cigarettes has also led to calls for new taxes and regulations.

Meanwhile, some governments are taking a more drastic approach. A recent proposal in Malawi aims to ban ""foul"" behavior in public, including farting, under the guise of environmental protection. While the intention may be to reduce pollution, critics argue that such laws could infringe on personal freedoms.

The debate over smoke-free zones and individual liberties raises important questions about the balance between public health and personal choice. As governments continue to weigh in on issues related to tobacco use and e-cigarettes, one thing is clear: the landscape of smoking regulations is changing rapidly.","Tobacco Industry Under Fire as Governments Crack Down on Smoking

In recent months, governments around the world have taken steps to reduce smoking in public places. In Spain, a new law has banned smoking in most enclosed public spaces, including bars and restaurants, effective immediately. The move is part of a broader trend in Western Europe, where Italy and France have also implemented similar bans.

The tobacco industry is facing increased pressure as governments raise taxes on cigarettes and restrict advertising. Imperial Brands, the world's fourth-largest tobacco company, has announced plans to close one of its Russian factories due to increased taxes and changes to sales regulations. The move will result in the loss of 284 jobs.

Despite these efforts, some industries are finding ways to circumvent smoking bans. In New York City, racinos – casinos with video slot machines – have reported that smoking bans have actually increased their popularity and profitability. However, not all industries are as fortunate. Toll booth workers, who are often exposed to exhaust fumes, may be seen as expendable in the push for a smoke-free environment.

As governments continue to crack down on tobacco use, some are questioning whether the measures go too far. A recent proposal to ban smoking in bars and restaurants has been met with resistance from some business owners, who argue that it is an overreach of government authority. Meanwhile, some experts are warning that the push for a smoke-free environment may be driven by moralistic attitudes rather than a genuine concern for public health.

In response to growing concerns about tobacco use, some governments are taking bold action. New York City has raised the age limit for buying cigarettes to 21, and other cities are following suit. Greece is also introducing a tougher smoking ban, which will outlaw lighting up in all public indoor areas and prohibit most tobacco advertising. As the debate over tobacco use continues, one thing is clear: governments are taking steps to reduce smoking in public places, and the industry must adapt to these changes.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - sign of the times: the state of cigarettes on the college campus
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! during the ’40s and ’50s, cigarettes were synonymous with sex appeal and sophistication. smokers could light up just about anywhere, from airplanes to doctors’ offices to their college dorm rooms. it wasn’t until the early 1960s when health officials began warning against the dangers, with the surgeon general releasing the first report linking cigarettes to cancer, heart disease and emphysema in 1964. since then, we’ve come a long way in our understanding of smoking’s health effects. it’s now common knowledge that tobacco use can play a role in many other serious illnesses and health problems — not to mention how it directly or indirectly causes the death of hundreds of thousands each year. as a result, greater regulations have been placed on cigarettes, limiting their marketing, sale and use in a variety of ways. over the past decade, as the negative health effects become increasingly clear, smoking has been banned in many public places, restaurants and bars throughout 27 states — though sporting varying levels of flexibility.colleges, many of which sit on public and state property, haven’t been exempt from these. in addition to following state regulations, many schools have issued an outright ban of using products on campus. many others hold strict rules about where and when tobacco products are allowed. it’s safe to say that lot has changed since those innocent days in the ’50s, when students puffed away blissfully unaware of the

heiress lives in a tent: government corruption is destroying america (before it's news) march 26, 2012 you know we have wonderful laws in this country that protect the public; the problem is the government authorities, as well as others, aren’t upholding these laws. unless consumers have gone through what larry and i have experienced they wouldn’t necessarily realize this nor would they care until crime hits their lives. they see cops pull over naughty drivers and given tickets so they think the authorities are working. i’ll tell you the traffic cops are the only ones who are, when they aren’t in trouble for committing outrageous crimes themselves. besides “the fort” banding together to protect financial institutions, other corporations such as insurance companies break federal laws everyday and the authorities do nothing. these crimes destroy lives too. yet, when a person robs a bank; cheats an insurance provider or on their taxes they go straight to prison, while the media goes wild against them. i wouldn’t be surprised to hear that the reason these consumers lower themselves into committing crime is because they’ve been so violated with it in the past and found out, the hard way, no authority would do anything. so they take matters into their own hands out of pure frustration and fear. but, does the media tell this part of the story? no they don’t and won’t. it draws sympathy from the public and warns them about unaddressed federal crime, embezzlement and other crimes involving millions

(before it's news) by walter burien – cafr1.com 12/17/14 i will keep this article very simple and to the point . on the syndicated news today they are pitching imposing a tax on e-cigarettes. the politician that introduced the bill justifies the new proposed tax with one and one only statement: “if we do not tax e-cigarettes, where else will we get the money we need from?” i have heard the same blanket comment over and over again per raising taxes for the last 40-years. that comment made by a politician to the public is the biggest insult that can be rendered per directly calling the listeners “useful idiots” when it comes down to the reality of government’s gross income from the many sources of: tax, investment, enterprise, etc. government’s gross income is obscene and has expanded exponentially each and every year through depending on the population being masterfully entertained while being spoon fed with blatant “selective presentation” with the contrived comment of: “where are we going to get the money from?” a good and clear analogy per the same would be; a politician sitting in a row-boat in the middle of the ocean who says:“where am i going to find salt water?” said with an overtone as if it were a genuine question, and depending on the listener’s ignorance not to see the ocean surrounding the row-boat.. here is a link with instructions to view and download many local government’s annual financial reports

unsafe at any smoke (before it's news) you didn’t think they’d stop at just buckle up laws, right? eric peters the american spectator 2/10/2012 mandatory buckle-up laws set the precedent: even your own body in your own car is no longer your own personal space. here’s how it works: the government decides that whatever it is you’re doing is “unsafe” — not specifically in your case, just generally -- maybe, might be, could be — then asserts the legal authority to criminalize whatever it is you’re doing. which means, it asserts the right to arrest you at gunpoint and threaten you implicitly and perhaps explicitly with lethal violence in order to force you to submit and obey. now they’re coming for your cigarettes. a study just released by the cdc (see here) characterizes second-hand smoke as the latest threat to “safety” — and of course, “the children.” it urges what you’d expect: that it be made illegal to smoke in your own car, at least, if “the children” are present and possibly even if they’re not. for as any smoker knows — as anyone who has shopped for used cars knows — any car that has been smoked in retains the essence of the marlboro man for years, even decades after the last butt was crumpled in the ashtray. there is no way to objectively tell whether a car was smoked in last week — or 10

""it's for the children and the elderly"" cried one of the ordinance supporters, made up of mostly angry bureaucrats, lawyers and their friends. many smokers and non-smokers voiced their concerns that city government was over regulating them to death. included were complaints that it appeared this smoking ordinance was created as a revenue maker for the city at the expense of smokers and restaurant/bar business owners. one opponent said, ""smoke police will have to be hired, creating another bureaucracy"". another said, ""if you're so concerned about children's safety, why do you allow aids carriers to work in restaurants?"". yet another said, ""if you care for children so much why don't you stop abortion?"" all comments fell on deaf ears. the city council members pretended to listen but you could tell their minds were made up weeks, perhaps months, in advance. meeting was held only because the law required it. they adopted

Article 10 - and you thought the smoking ban was bad!
and you thought the smoking ban was bad! (before it's news) the ban on smoking in private public places has been much-criticised by freedom-loving liberals, who argue that it should be the decision of the property owner whether smoking may occur in his or her establishment. the debate around genuinely “public” places is more complex, but the general argument goes to the very heart of the definition of a free society, and raises the hoary old chestnut of positive verses negative liberty: whether one person’s freedom to smoke is an assault on another’s liberty. still, at least smoking is a choice. imagine a society where the government banned natural bodily functions for the same reasons that ours has banned smoking. or, if your imagination fails you, why not visit one! malawi, it seems, may have accidentally banned farting in public. the local courts bill, to be introduced next week, contains a clause that reads “any person who vitiates the atmosphere in any place so as to make it noxious to the public to the health of persons in general dwelling or carrying on business in the neighbourhood or passing along a public way shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.” now, solicitor general anthony kamanga insists that “fouling the air” refers to pollution and that this is purely an environmental protection provision. “how any reasonable or sensible person can construe the provision to criminalising farting in public is beyond me,” he said. however, the unreasonable and

Article 1 - in transit: spain enacts tougher smoking ban
a classic trio in bars all over spain - tapas, a glass of wine and a cigarette - has just lost a member. starting this month, smoking is no longer permitted in most enclosed public spaces, including bars, cafes and restaurants. the new law, voted into effect by national legislators late last year, expands existing antismoking regulations in the country, which had already outlawed the practice in workplaces and on public transit. under the old rules, bar and restaurant owners with spaces smaller than 100 square meters (about 1,100 square feet) were able to decide themselves whether to allow smoking; perhaps not surprisingly, almost all allowed it. but no longer. the new law continues the smoking ban trend in western europe: italy outlawed smoking in most enclosed public places in 2005; france followed in 2008. fines for breaking the new law start at a modest 30 euros (about $40), but can escalate to 100,000 euros for repeated breaches. the law also prohibits smoking outside schools and hospitals and in areas near children's playgrounds. some bar and restaurant owners, as well as customers, have defied the ban, with the bbc reporting that one restaurant in the andalusian town of marbella has put up a poster that reads, ''we inform you that as a private business we are making use of our rights and that law will not be applied in our establishment.'' what do you think about antismoking laws like these?

1:13pm gmt imperial brands to shut russian tobacco factory view of a sign outside the imperial tobacco seita cigarette plant in carquefou, near nantes, april 15, 2014. reuters/stephane mahe/file photo moscow imperial brands ( imb.l ), the world's fourth-biggest tobacco company, will shut one of its two russian factories in january, it said on tuesday, citing increased taxes and the impact of changes to sales regulations. the closure also comes as the company accelerates a cost-cutting drive in an increasingly competitive industry in which larger rival british american tobacco (bat)( bats.l ) has proposed a $47 billion buyout of reynolds american ( rai.n ), potentially sparking further sector consolidation. ""among the factors that influenced our decision to close the factory was (the) increasing ... tax burden on our goods. we've been also impacted by a ban on production of packs containing more than 20 cigarettes,"" imperial said in a statement. the yaroslavl plant operated by the group's imperial tobacco subsidiary, is working at 40 percent of capacity and will be shut on jan. 1, with the loss of 284 jobs, it said. russia began tightening regulations of the tobacco market in 2013, restricting cigarette sales and banning advertising and sponsorship of events by tobacco companies, followed by a ban on smoking in public places. it has also raised excise taxes, hurting a russian cigarette market

Article 4 - raising nicotine doses, on the sly
while most of us thought the country was trying to curb smoking, and the rapacious habits of the tobacco companies, it turns out the industry has been sneakily making cigarettes more addictive. evidence of what looks like an increasingly desperate effort to hook new young smokers and prevent older ones from quitting has been uncovered by a massachusetts law that forces tobacco companies to report test results showing how much nicotine is inhaled by typical smokers of their various brands. this week, the massachusetts department of public health revealed that from 1998 through 2004, as public health campaigns were mounted to curb smoking, the manufacturers increased the amount of addictive nicotine delivered to the average smoker by 10 percent. of 179 cigarette brands tested in 2004, an astonishing 166 brands fell into the state’s highest nicotine yield range, including 59 brands that the manufacturers had labeled “light” and 14 described as “ultra-light.” the three most popular brands chosen by young smokers — marlboro, newport and camel — all delivered significantly more nicotine as the years passed. virtually all brands were found to deliver a high enough nicotine dose to cause heavy dependence. this trend has escaped notice because the standard government test uses a smoking machine that fails to mimic real-life smoking. a manufacturer, for example, can design a cigarette that will score low in nicotine delivery to the machine by placing tiny ventilation holes in the filter to dilute the smoke. but in real life a smoker will often cover the vents with lips

Article 5 - smoke-free gambling site thrives amid debate on ban
but the owners of racinos, racetracks with video slot machines, say smoking bans have not cut into their popularity or their profitability. so far, say officials at yonkers raceway, one of seven such gambling emporiums in new york state, the smoking ban has proved to be more of an attraction than a deterrent to business. while racinos, with their slot machines, blur the lines with casinos, with their table games, there is little question that operations like the one in yonkers have brought new revenue to the tracks and to the state, rescuing harness and thoroughbred racing from extinction. in new jersey, the efforts to ban smoking have been as tremulous as a smoke ring. last year the legislature approved a total ban on smoking in restaurants and bars, but exempted casinos. this year, the city council in atlantic city, under pressure from antismoking advocates and casino employees, broached the notion of a total smoking ban. after casino operators warned of economic harm, the council relented and last month approved a measure allowing smoking on 25 percent of the gambling floors. about three weeks later, the state senate health committee unanimously passed a measure that would do away with the exemption, but obstacles thrown up by the casino operators are considerable, and prospects for its final passage are uncertain. besides the millions in revenue they bring into the state, casino operators are also large political contributors. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not

Article 6 - toll booths too?
to the editor: the personal health column on aug. 27, ''a jubilant barroom toast: to smoke-free air,'' makes clear that the rationale for the proposed smoking ban in bars and restaurants is the protection of the health of those who work in such establishments. what about toll booth workers? how does breathing exhaust fumes all day compare to inhaling some cigarette smoke? will we soon see proposals to abolish toll booths? i don't think so. toll collectors are apparently expendable for obvious reasons. it's difficult not to conclude that the real driving force for many of the antismoking zealots is puritanical moralism rather than the health of workers. gerald leonard kingston, n.y.

Article 8 - new york raising age to buy cigarettes to 21
besides raising the age to buy cigarettes, the council also approved various other antismoking measures, such as increased penalties for retailers who evade tobacco taxes, a prohibition on discounts for tobacco products, and a minimum price of $10.50 a pack for cigarettes and little cigars. the new law is a capstone to more than a decade of efforts by mr. bloomberg, like banning smoking in most public places, that have given the city some of the toughest antismoking policies in the world. in one concession to the cigarette industry, the administration dropped a proposal that would force retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight. city officials said they were doing it because they had not resolved how to deal with the new phenomenon of electronic cigarettes, but others worried that if the tobacco industry lodged a first amendment challenge to the so-called display ban, it could have derailed the entire package. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the smoking age is 18 in most of the country, but some states have made it 19. some counties have also adopted 19, including nassau and suffolk on long island. needham

Tobacco Industry Under Fire as Governments Crack Down on Smoking

In recent months, governments around the world have taken steps to reduce smoking in public places. In Spain, a new law has banned smoking in most enclosed public spaces, including bars and restaurants, effective immediately. The move is part of a broader trend in Western Europe, where Italy and France have also implemented similar bans.

The tobacco industry is facing increased pressure as governments raise taxes on cigarettes and restrict advertising. Imperial Brands, the world's fourth-largest tobacco company, has announced plans to close one of its Russian factories due to increased taxes and changes to sales regulations. The move will result in the loss of 284 jobs.

Despite these efforts, some industries are finding ways to circumvent smoking bans. In New York City, racinos – casinos with video slot machines – have reported that smoking bans have actually increased their popularity and profitability. However, not all industries are as fortunate. Toll booth workers, who are often exposed to exhaust fumes, may be seen as expendable in the push for a smoke-free environment.

As governments continue to crack down on tobacco use, some are questioning whether the measures go too far. A recent proposal to ban smoking in bars and restaurants has been met with resistance from some business owners, who argue that it is an overreach of government authority. Meanwhile, some experts are warning that the push for a smoke-free environment may be driven by moralistic attitudes rather than a genuine concern for public health.

""Smoke-Free Zones: A Changing Landscape""

In the past, cigarettes were a ubiquitous part of college life, with students often smoking in public places without a second thought. However, as the health risks associated with tobacco use became more widely understood, regulations began to tighten. Today, many colleges and universities have banned smoking on campus, citing concerns for student health and safety.

But the trend towards smoke-free zones extends beyond academia. In recent years, cities and towns across the US have implemented strict anti-smoking laws, including bans on smoking in public places and restaurants. The rise of e-cigarettes has also led to calls for new taxes and regulations.

Meanwhile, some governments are taking a more drastic approach. A recent proposal in Malawi aims to ban ""foul"" behavior in public, including farting, under the guise of environmental protection. While the intention may be to reduce pollution, critics argue that such laws could infringe on personal freedoms.

The debate over smoke-free zones and individual liberties raises important questions about the balance between public health and personal choice. As governments continue to weigh in on issues related to tobacco use and e-cigarettes, one thing is clear: the landscape of smoking regulations is changing rapidly.

Article 1 - norris loses his request
a manhattan judge yesterday rejected a request by orlin norris that the court seize $2 million of the $6 million fight purse that mike tyson will be paid for a match in england today. norris sued tyson for $2 million this week, charging that tyson had broken an agreement the boxers had made for a heavyweight rematch. judge barry a. cozier of state supreme court denied norris's request for the emergency seizure of the money and said it was unlikely that norris's lawsuit would prevail in court. norris claimed that tyson reneged on an oral agreement for a rematch the two struck immediately after their bout last oct. 23 in las vegas. that fight ended when tyson hit norris after the bell ending the first round had sounded, an act the referee called a flagrant foul. the late hit and an injury norris suffered resulted in the match being declared no contest. norris claimed that tyson's manager, shelly finkel, feared tyson would be suspended for the flagrant foul. norris said he was promised a rematch with a $2 million purse if he would say he believed tyson's foul was unintentional. norris said he kept his part of the bargain, but the rematch never occurred. judd burstein, norris's lawyer, did not respond to a message left at his office last night. but jerry bernstein, tyson's lawyer, predicted that the lawsuit would be

the former heavyweight champion joe frazier has liver cancer and is under hospice care. the 67-year-old frazier received the diagnosis four or five weeks ago, said leslie wolff, frazier’s personal and business manager. wolff said saturday that doctors had not told frazier how long he had to live. frazier was the first man to beat muhammad ali, taking a decision in the so-called fight of the century at madison square garden in 1971. he lost two later fights to ali, including what was known as the thrilla in manila in 1975.

Article 3 - the great british-pakistani-muslim hope
millions of viewers in the u.k. watched on tv as kindelan outpointed khan 30-22 for the gold medal. afterward, the 17-year-old khan was the toast of britain, besieged by tv and print media, lawyers, promoters and sponsors who asked him what kind of after-shave he used. and he was the subject of a national debate: should he turn pro and become rich now, or should he remain an amateur until the 2008 olympics and seek glory for the u.k.? the debate was effectively settled in may 2005, when khan met kindelan in bolton for an amateur rematch. ""the kid took the cuban to school,"" frank warren, a boxing promoter known as ""the don king of british boxing,"" told me. after the fight, khan, with no amateurs left to challenge him, turned pro and signed with warren's sports network. warren, in his 50's, had a plan to make khan a world champion and a millionaire by his 21st birthday. it is a plan that has gone smoothly so far. khan has won all six of his fights, including in january a first-round tko of vitali martynov, a highly rated belarussian who had won 10 of his previous 11 fights. when khan turns 20 later this year, he will be eligible to fight for a british lightweight crown. in the

jose aldo, the man who lost his ufc featherweight title when he was knocked out by conor mcgregor inside 13 seconds, wants another shot at the irishman – because he lost his crown “by accident”. conor mcgregor gives up ufc featherweight title but keeps lightweight belt read more the 30-year-old brazilian said of mcgregor: “it’s not my fault that he’s a coward. he was never the champion.” the ufc announced over the weekend that mcgregor was vacating the featherweight title he won by beating aldo in december, ending his spell as a two-division champion. mcgregor never defended the belt, which means aldo reclaims the title – but aldo said he wouldn’t be satisfied without a rematch. the brazilian said: “i knew for certain that this would happen [mcgregor giving up his belt]. in my opinion, i never stopped being the champion. i lost that fight because of an accident.” aldo, speaking in portuguese, told ufc : “i knew that i would win a rematch and would become champion again. it’s not my fault that he’s a coward. he was never the champion. i don’t see myself losing to anyone in my weight class or any other one.” mcgregor remains the lightweight title holder. but aldo said he is happy to move up to the 155lb class for a rematch. “

Article 6 - rare view: gordon parks b. 1912
gordon parks was nothing if not prolific, and he wasn’t shy about putting his work out there. as a photojournalist for life magazine, he became one of the country’s most important chroniclers of social inequality and racial strife — and at the same time made portraits of everyone from barbra streisand to alexander calder. photo he also shot fashion for vogue, wrote more than a dozen volumes of fiction, poetry and autobiography, directed several feature films, including “shaft,” and sometimes even composed the music for them. given how willing he was to go public in so many ways, it is a bit surprising to learn that when it came to his photographic work, parks was unusually protective: he never wanted to let a single image out of his studio that didn’t make his own personal a-list. but even a portion of a contact sheet (provided by his foundation), from his first life photo session with muhammad ali in 1966, shows what an eye the self-taught parks possessed. at the time, the reigning heavyweight champion was being scorned by many for his conversion to the nation of islam and his resistance to the draft. in nine shots, a sense of ali’s physical elegance, prowess, defiance, warmth and, perhaps, isolation comes through.

Article 8 - inside the ring or out, muhammad ali fought as if he would live forever
“i’m not suffering,” ali told reporters. “i’m in no pain. it’s really nothing i can’t live with. but i go to bed and sleep eight, 10 hours. and two hours after i get up, i’m tired and drowsy again. sometimes, i have trembling in my hands. my speech is slurred. people say to me: ‘what did you say? i can’t understand you.’ i’m not scared, but my family and friends are scared to death.” more muhammad ali coverage by then, he was suffering from a series of symptoms — slurred speech, difficulty in maintaining balance, a facial mask and a tremor in his hands — known as parkinson’s syndrome. dr. stanley fahn is the director of the center for parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders at columbia university. in 1984, he was the supervising physician for ali’s evaluation at columbia-presbyterian. fahn spoke openly with me several years later regarding ali’s medical condition, with permission from ali. his condition, fahn concluded, had been caused by physical trauma that destroyed cells in his brainstem. “he has asked that i speak freely and completely,” fahn said at the time. “so i’ll tell you my diagnosis that it was a post-traumatic parkinsonism due to injuries from fighting. it’s highly unlikely that it all came from one fight. my assumption is that his physical condition resulted from repeated

Article 9 - phil davis adds 'mma champion' to resume with lopsided win at bellator 163
comments phil davis first gained notoriety as a national wrestling champion at penn state. then he took his wrestling talents to the ufc, where he reached contender status but never fought for a belt. in 2015, he went outside the octagon for his biggest move as a pro, becoming the most prominent fighter to that point to leave the ufc for bellator mma . on friday at bellator 163, davis added a new line item and high-water mark on his career: mma champion. coming into the bout, liam mcgeary was widely considered a tough out and a worthy bellator light heavyweight champ. davis ripped a few holes in those conventions when he tore through mcgeary's takedown defense. in each of the five rounds, davis drove the champ to the mat and advanced his position, frequently achieving full mount and putting mcgeary in all sorts of compromising spots. clearly not satisfied to simply control his opponent, davis worked for submissions and better position throughout the bout. — darrion caldwell (@thewolfmma) november 5, 2016 davis even looked better in his striking, historically (and still) his biggest weakness as an mma fighter. a big left hand wobbled mcgeary and set the tone early, while rangy leg kicks and punch combinations were enough to set up those takedowns and avoid big exchanges with mcgeary, who has a bruiser's reputation

Article 10 - eddie futch, who trained fighters his way, dies at 90
their association was typical of futch's relationship with his fighters. he mixed compassion with tough love. when trevor berbick did not want to sacrifice himself to training after he became heavyweight champion in 1986, futch walked away from him. eddie futch was born in mississippi on aug. 9, 1911, and grew up in detroit, where he was a star semipro basketball player before he gravitated to boxing. he remembered ''growing up in the brewster center there, when joe louis was an amateur and when sugar ray robinson, who was walker smith then, was just a little kid hanging around.'' futch captured the detroit golden gloves lightweight title in 1933 and extended his amateur record to 37-3 before a doctor discovered a heart murmur that ended his six-year career in 1936. by then, futch was established as a coach. because of his speed -- and his lack of power -- futch, who was outweighed by 70 pounds, had also become louis's favorite sparring partner. the role, futch once recalled, demanded cunning. ''i had to devise ways and means of not getting killed,'' he said. futch did it well enough to provide louis with an elusive target. ''joe used to tell me, 'if i can hit you, eddie, i can hit anybody,' '' he said. but one day louis bashed him with a right hand and

Overall, while both articles discuss similar topics, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more accurate and closely aligns with the facts presented in the original article.","Russia's Military Expansion: A Shift in Global Power Dynamics

In recent months, Russia has been actively expanding its military presence in the Middle East and North Africa. The country has announced plans to sell advanced air defense systems to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, sparking concerns about its intentions and potential implications for global security.

Meanwhile, Syria remains a focal point of international attention, with various countries vying for influence in the region. Russia's involvement in the conflict has been significant, with reports suggesting that Chinese aircraft carriers are set to join Russian air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which have been active in Syria and Iraq. The United States has been involved in military operations against these groups, but its efforts have been met with resistance from Russia-backed forces.

In a surprising move, Saudi Arabia has offered Russia a secret deal to control the global oil market and safeguard Russian gas contracts, in exchange for backing away from the Assad regime. This proposal has raised eyebrows among analysts, who see it as an attempt by Saudi Arabia to gain leverage over Russia.

The implications of these developments are far-reaching, with potential consequences for global security, economic stability, and regional politics. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the Middle East and North Africa have become a hotbed of international tensions, with multiple players vying for influence in the region.","Global Tensions Escalate as Russia Expands Influence

A series of high-stakes diplomatic maneuvers has underscored the growing tensions between major world powers. A recent deal worth $13 billion, brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been hailed as a significant breakthrough in energy cooperation.

However, this development has not gone unnoticed by other nations. The United States, for instance, is increasingly concerned about Russia's military build-up in Syria and its potential sale of advanced air defense systems to the Syrian government. This could significantly limit the ability of Western nations to operate over Syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone.

Meanwhile, Japan has expressed concerns about Russia's deployment of missiles on disputed islands in the Pacific, which it views as ""deplorable."" The two countries have been locked in a decades-long territorial dispute, with tensions hindering trade and investment between them.

In another development, Uzbekistan has proposed a novel solution to the logistical challenges of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. With NATO forces expected to remove millions of vehicles and shipping containers over the next two years, Uzbekistan is offering its expertise in managing these operations.

As the world grapples with these complex issues, experts warn that Russia's actions are often difficult to discern from those of cybercriminals. The country's military build-up and diplomatic efforts have raised concerns about its intentions, particularly in the context of Syria and Ukraine.

Despite these tensions, some analysts argue that Putin's strategic genius has been exaggerated. In 2010, he was seen as a key player in international diplomacy, with his government helping to install an ally in Ukraine and improving relations with Europe and the United States. However, this progress has since stalled, and Russia's actions have become increasingly provocative.

As the world watches these developments unfold, one thing is clear: the global balance of power is shifting, and nations must be prepared to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - why is russia selling s-400s to saudi arabia and turkey?
(before it's news) moscow is selling s-400 air defence systems to turkey and saudi arabia. in the first case, a down payment has apparently been made while in the second the intention has been announced. this immediately presents the question of why moscow would agree to sell one of its crown jewel weapons systems to countries which are not only not solid allies but are, in fact, american allies. the “atlanticist view” answer to the question would run something like this: putin’s “hold on power” is trembling, the russian economy is in trouble, russia is running out of money and because it has only two exports, weapons and energy, it is desperate to sell either to anyone. and, right on cue, from the usual people, we had this a couple of weeks ago: putin’s hold on russia may be more fragile than it appears. one reason is western economic sanctions, which are biting and causing hardship to russian businesses and ordinary citizens. another is the dependence of russia’s economy on fossil fuels at a time when oil prices are down and not expected to rebound soon. to the extent that putin’s legitimacy rests on prosperity, russia’s economic woes are a problem for him. while no one in the report stated that “putin’s russia” might sell weapons, the participants would probably see such sales as another indications of “economic woes”. to them “russia has effectively declared political war on the west, even

syria: examining the trump effect on russia’s syria policy (before it's news) 21st century wire says… breaking news from russia today has shocked geopolitical commentators and analysts. the controversy over president trump’s proposals for us administered “safe zones” inside syria is now amplified by foreign minister sergey lavrov’s statement today: “russia may support the us initiative to establish so-called ‘safe zones’ for refugees in syria, foreign minister sergey lavrov said. the plan would require close cooperation with the un and approval from syrian president bashar assad’s government, he added. lavrov said the american proposal to create secure areas for refugees within syria was put forward in the context of migrant flows to the neighboring countries, the middle east, as well as europe, and “at the end of the day, the us. if this is about the people who were forced to leave their homes by the conflict, […] getting their basic needs covered, […] then i think that the idea to create areas within syria for those internally displaced could be discussed with the un’s high commissioner for refugees and other organizations,” he said.” reuters have reported a more perturbing aspect of trump’s “safe zone” project, which is the inclusion of primary, global producer of terrorism, saudi arabia. riyadh has been responsible for the funding, equipping and arming of some of the most extremist, ethnic cleansing, wahhabi factions,

Article 6 - america's self-inflicted defense woes
(before it's news) ulson gunnar – neo ) – the united states poses as a champion against the great threats facing global security and stability, an uphill battle it claims requires equally great sacrifices, especially in terms of defense spending. it must be just a coincidence that the many policy think-tanks promoting this notion just so happen to be funded by huge multinational defense contractors. the atlantic council, for instance, includes among its corporate members, airbus, lockheed martin, raytheon, thales, boeing and northrop grumman, just to name a few. so when atlantic council authors wrote about the subject of close air support (cas) aircraft, it should come as no surprise that the development or procurement of a new system was the option of choice, this despite the fact that a brand new aircraft, the lockheed martin f-35 lightning ii, was already supposed to fill this role. the atlantic council’s article, “starting with the answer in procurement: the usaf’s plans for new close support aircraft show an unusual willingness to move out quickly,” would claim: …after years of hearing that the f-35a would be the sort-of replacement for the a-10c, it’s worth reviewing why it never could be. it’s not for the gun or the armor. it’s the increased threat: russian motorized rifle brigades now run with lots of their own 30 mm guns, looking up. missiles are now a bigger problem too

Article 7 - russian officials come to egypt, reportedly to negotiate arms deal
(before it's news) russian officials are reportedly in egypt to negotiate an arms deal in what the bbc is describing as “the highest level visit to egypt by a russian delegation in years.” last month, the u.s. suspended some of its military aid to egypt following the military-backed government’s crackdown on supporters of ousted president morsi, who was removed from power by the military, a move which the obama administration has resisted calling a coup. the suspension of aid was a significant change in u.s policy towards egypt. according to the congressional research service, “between 1948 and 2011, the united states provided egypt with a total of $$71.6 billion in bilateral foreign aid, including $$1.3 billion a year in military aid from 1987 to the present.” the meeting between russian and egyptian officials is an indication that the military-backed egyptian government may be able to enjoy a huge amount of foreign military aid without the u.s. despite the fact that the meeting comes after some american military aid to egypt was suspended, russian foreign minister sergei lavrov has claimed that russia is not looking to replace “any country.” however, political analyst samir ghattas told euronews that the obama administration’s changing relationship with egypt has prompted egyptian officials to revive relations with russia: samir ghattas: “the policies of the united states have caused serious unease and confusion in the middle

it’s been a more-than-usual eventful week in the middle east. russian-backed forces made yet more significant military gains in defeating us-sponsored proxies in syria, with a fearsome display of long-range russian air and naval firepower against militant hold-outs near deir ez-zor. that was while russian president vladimir putin was greeted in the iranian capital tehran by ayatollah khamenei – a meeting that spoke volumes of the new reality of geopolitical authority in the region. then days later, the saudi-backed lebanese premier saad hariri makes a “surprise” resignation, which wasn’t really a surprise for those who are watching events closely. hariri made his blustering speech while in the saudi capital riyadh, accusing iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah of “destabilizing” his country, and even plotting to assassinate him. iran denounced hariri’s antics as “grandstanding” and kowtowing to a political agenda set by washington and its regional allies, saudi arabia and israel, aimed at smearing iran and hezbollah. lebanon’s president michel aoun, who has fairly good relations with iran and hezbollah, was none too pleased either by his prime minister’s farewell announcement televised in the saudi capital. aoun reportedly said, rather drily, that he expected hariri to return to lebanon soon to explain his resignation while

Article 2 - shifting direction, kerry aims to include iran in efforts to end the conflict in syria
but with the islamic state terrorist group making gains in syria, a tidal wave of migrants swamping europe, no formal peace talks in sight and russia engaged in a military buildup at an air base near latakia, on syria’s mediterranean coast, mr. kerry is now reaching out to iran, which has been a major backer of the syrian president, bashar al-assad, to see if there is a basis for resuming negotiations. mr. kerry has also been consulting with russia, european nations and arab states. mr. kerry’s meeting with mr. zarif was his first since six world powers and iran reached a nuclear accord in july. while american officials discussed syria with the iranians on the margins of the nuclear talks, they saw the saturday meeting as a chance for a fuller discussion. still, the conditions for a breakthrough on syria are not auspicious. the obama administration’s ability to shape a diplomatic outcome in syria has been diminished by the pentagon’s failure to train and equip more than a handful of moderate syrian rebels to confront the islamic state. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an

Article 3 - online security experts link more breaches to russian government
fireeye is one of several security firms to tie the russian government to hacking incidents. in july, three security firms, symantec, f-secure and crowdstrike, also tied a string of coordinated attacks on western oil and gas companies to moscow. united states intelligence analysts have long cited russia as a major concern. one top-secret 2009 national security agency intelligence estimate obtained by the new york times last year named russia as the most sophisticated adversary for the united states in cyberspace. but diplomatic efforts have predominantly been aimed at curbing digital threats from china. attacks from hackers in china are typically less sophisticated, but far more prolific than those originating in russia. the fireeye report notes, however, that it is often difficult to discern between russian government attacks and attacks conducted by russian cybercriminals. “you only exist as a significant russian cybercriminal if you abide by three rules,” said tom kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at trend micro, a security firm based in irving, tex. “you are not allowed to hack anything within the sovereign boundary; if you find anything of interest to the regime you share it; and when called upon for ‘patriotic activities,’ you do so. in exchange you get ‘untouchable status.’ ” one top-secret 2009 n.s.a. report, for example, named the russian nashi, a pro-kremlin youth group, as the culprit behind the powerful 2007 cyberattacks on est

Article 5 - a romney travels to russia, but on strictly friendly terms
the romney campaign said it had no comment. the russian embassy in washington said it was unaware of the trip. “we haven’t got any information about mr. romney and his visit to moscow,” said yevgeny khorishko, an embassy spokesman. “he didn’t inform us about his visit.” but while in moscow, mr. romney told a russian known to be able to deliver messages to mr. putin that despite the campaign rhetoric, his father wants good relations if he becomes president, according to a person informed about the conversation. matt romney traveled to moscow with gary b. sabin, the chairman and chief executive of excel trust, which is based in san diego. greg davis, the firm’s vice president of capital markets and communications, said the trip was unrelated to the campaign. “it is a harmless trip,” mr. davis said. “it was a trip that has been planned for some time. any travel they’ve done on behalf of excel is strictly on the private side. it would have nothing to do with anything governmental.” excel is a real estate investment trust that focuses on shopping centers largely in states from california to florida and up to pennsylvania. by distributing 90 percent or more of its taxable income in the form of a dividend, it helps investors avoid double taxation under the law, mr. davis said. the firm reported $820 million in assets to the securities exchange commission as of j

Article 6 - japan has called russian missile deployment on disputed islands 'deplorable'
print afp / file eitan abramovich tokyo (afp) - japan has told russia the deployment of missiles on disputed islands in the pacific is ""deplorable"", prime minister shinzo abe said friday, ahead of talks aimed at resolving a decades-old territorial spat. the positioning of coastal defence missiles on two of the four islands in contention was reported by russian media this week and comes after concerted efforts by both countries to improve relations. japan-russian ties have been hamstrung by a row dating back to the end of world war ii when soviet troops seized the southernmost islands in the kuril chain, known as the northern territories in japan, that lies off the northeast coast of hokkaido. the tensions have prevented the countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending wartime hostilities, and have hindered trade and investment. ""the northern territories are an inherent part of japan's territory,"" abe told parliament on friday. abe said japan had told russia the deployment ""is deplorable"" and ""is contradictory to japan's position"" on the issue. spokeswoman of the russian foreign ministry, maria zakharova maxim shemetov/reuters however, russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said thursday the missile deployment was aimed at the ""consistent strengthening of national security"". ""missile systems were deployed to the southern kurils in line with that position,"" she said, calling them ""an integral part of russian

Article 7 - aeroflot is pressed to buy russian
mr. putin spoke during an apparently stage-managed meeting, broadcast on state television. but there was nothing artificial about the message, delivered just two weeks before the jet industry’s largest international trade show opened monday at farnborough, near london: russian airlines will be under pressure to buy russian jets. aeroflot declined to comment for this article on its purchasing policies or on mr. putin’s discussion with mr. savelyev. photo for a decade, russian airlines have been steady customers of foreign aircraft makers. aeroflot’s fleet consists mainly of airbus a320s and a330s and boeing 767s. and the airline has orders for an additional 44 boeings and airbuses, even as the russian authorities are trying to salvage the country’s civilian jet makers — tupolev, ilyushin, antonov and yak. experts say that russian airplanes are well constructed. poor maintenance and repair records, however, earned them a bad reputation for safety after the soviet union collapsed. and, as any passenger can attest, they are more noisy and cramped than their western rivals. last year, aeroflot sold to smaller russian airlines its tupolev jets, the workhorse passenger aircraft of the former east bloc. now, only six of about 110 jets in its fleet are russian made. those planes, ilyushin il-96s, which carry about 260 passengers, fly within russia and to a few

Article 8 - as nato prepares for afghan withdrawal, uzbekistan seeks war’s leftovers
but what uzbek officials are offering, however, has value. over the next two years, nato forces are expected to remove about 70,000 vehicles and 120,000 shipping containers from afghanistan, and the way out will require rail lines and well-surfaced roads. although pakistani ports are seen as the most efficient avenue for the cargo’s withdrawal, alternatives will be important, and allied officials are mindful of a potential disruption if pakistan ever decides to again close the routes or ask for more money, as it did during a diplomatic crisis with the united states in 2011 and 2012. the united states government has taken the uzbek proposal seriously enough to partially lift a set of arms sales restrictions that have been in place for about a decade. and it has held interagency meetings in washington this month to consider the latest uzbek proposal, according to nongovernmental experts on american policy in the region. the uzbek request illustrates the difficult logistics of winding down the war, an unglamorous coda to a fight that began with troops parachuting in out of the night sky. as was the case in the withdrawal from iraq in 2011, the cost of shipping used equipment to the united states often exceeds its value. the army left tens of thousands of air-conditioned residential trailers in iraq, and many of the armored vehicles that were rolled across the border into kuwait were mothballed there. a legacy of abandoned weapons is a

Article 9 - u.s. fears russia may sell air-defense system to syria
washington — the united states, which is trying to bring syrian rebels and the syrian government to the negotiating table, is now increasingly worried that russia plans to sell a sophisticated air defense system to syria, american officials said wednesday. russia has a long history of selling arms to the syrians and has a naval base in the country. but the delivery of the russian s-300 missile batteries would represent a major qualitative advancement in syria’s air defenses. the system is regarded as highly effective and would limit the ability of the united states and other nations to operate over syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone. it is also able to track and fire missiles at multiple targets, including aircraft and some missiles. “there are concerns that this might happen,” said a senior united states official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to the possible delivery of the s-300. a western intelligence service has also warned that the russians may soon send s-300 air defense batteries to syria, said another american official who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports. advertisement continue reading the main story news of the possible russian sale, which was first reported online by the wall street journal on wednesday evening, came less than a day after secretary of state john kerry sought to enlist russia’s help in facilitating a political transition that would supplant president bashar al-assad of syria.

Article 10 - the myth­ of putin’s strategic genius
five years ago, russia was on the move in the world. in 2010 in ukraine, the kremlin helped install its ally, viktor f. yanukovych. elsewhere in the former soviet space, russia’s leaders were making progress on what would become the eurasian economic union, their answer to the european union. moscow had also improved relations with europe and the united states. president dmitri a. medvedev even attended nato’s lisbon summit meeting in 2010 and spoke of developing “a strategic partnership” that would put “the difficult period in our relations behind us now.” the main topic was cooperation on missile defense, not nato expansion. both the american and russian public noticed the progress. in 2010, about two-thirds of russians had a positive view of the united states, while a similar proportion of americans saw russia as an ally or partner. the russian economy was returning to growth after the 2008 financial crisis. trade with the united states was expanding, there were closer ties with european economies, and russia was on track to join the world trade organization. in 2010, russia also played an essential role in securing new sanctions against iran. in doing so, it demonstrated bold international leadership even at the price of straining relations with an important ally. advertisement continue reading the main story and then, in 2011, the people started getting in the way.

Title: india-russia ties are strengthened by military and energy deals
Content: goa, india — india and russia signed billions of dollars’ worth of military and energy deals on saturday at a summit meeting that sought to inject new life into a relationship that has been tested by shifting global alliances and conflict in the middle east. under the biggest agreement, a group led by the russian state oil giant rosneft said it would pay $12.9 billion for a controlling stake in both india’s essar oil and the port facilities the company owns. in addition, the countries, which had strong ties during the cold war, announced plans for a joint venture to build helicopters in india. new delhi said it would also buy surface-to-air missile systems and stealth frigates from moscow. “ours is a truly unique and privileged relationship,” prime minister narendra modi of india said after talks with president vladimir putin of russia in the western seaside state of goa. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. modi said his views were aligned with mr. putin’s on the unstable situation in afghanistan and the middle east, where moscow is at odds with the west in the five-year-old civil war in syria that has killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Russia's Military Expansion: A Shift in Global Power Dynamics

In recent months, Russia has been actively expanding its military presence in the Middle East and North Africa. The country has announced plans to sell advanced air defense systems to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, sparking concerns about its intentions and potential implications for global security.

Meanwhile, Syria remains a focal point of international attention, with various countries vying for influence in the region. Russia's involvement in the conflict has been significant, with reports suggesting that Chinese aircraft carriers are set to join Russian air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which have been active in Syria and Iraq. The United States has been involved in military operations against these groups, but its efforts have been met with resistance from Russia-backed forces.

In a surprising move, Saudi Arabia has offered Russia a secret deal to control the global oil market and safeguard Russian gas contracts, in exchange for backing away from the Assad regime. This proposal has raised eyebrows among analysts, who see it as an attempt by Saudi Arabia to gain leverage over Russia.

The implications of these developments are far-reaching, with potential consequences for global security, economic stability, and regional politics. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the Middle East and North Africa have become a hotbed of international tensions, with multiple players vying for influence in the region.

Global Tensions Escalate as Russia Expands Influence

A series of high-stakes diplomatic maneuvers has underscored the growing tensions between major world powers. A recent deal worth $13 billion, brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been hailed as a significant breakthrough in energy cooperation.

However, this development has not gone unnoticed by other nations. The United States, for instance, is increasingly concerned about Russia's military build-up in Syria and its potential sale of advanced air defense systems to the Syrian government. This could significantly limit the ability of Western nations to operate over Syrian airspace or impose a no-fly zone.

Meanwhile, Japan has expressed concerns about Russia's deployment of missiles on disputed islands in the Pacific, which it views as ""deplorable."" The two countries have been locked in a decades-long territorial dispute, with tensions hindering trade and investment between them.

In another development, Uzbekistan has proposed a novel solution to the logistical challenges of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. With NATO forces expected to remove millions of vehicles and shipping containers over the next two years, Uzbekistan is offering its expertise in managing these operations.

As the world grapples with these complex issues, experts warn that Russia's actions are often difficult to discern from those of cybercriminals. The country's military build-up and diplomatic efforts have raised concerns about its intentions, particularly in the context of Syria and Ukraine.

Despite these tensions, some analysts argue that Putin's strategic genius has been exaggerated.

The college football coaching carousel is in full swing, with several high-profile hires and firings announced recently. One of the most notable moves is Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano reportedly becoming the next head coach at Tennessee.

Meanwhile, former Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick has been making headlines for his potential return to the sidelines. After being fired by Steve Bisciotti in 2007, Billick has been working as a broadcaster and analyst. However, sources close to the situation suggest that he may be ready to get back behind the wheel.

In other news, Texas A&M has parted ways with coach Kevin Sumlin after six seasons at the helm. The Aggies are reportedly searching for a new head coach, with Dan Mullen being a potential target.

The coaching world is also seeing some changes in South Carolina, where Lt. Governor Andre Bauer has rehired two former staff members to help manage his transition out of office. Jim Miles and Frank Adams have returned to their roles as chief of staff and deputy chief of staff, respectively.

In a bizarre incident, a youth football coach was fired after pulling a gun on a mob of angry parents during a game in Wichita. The coach had previously been removed from the team due to disciplinary issues with one of his players.

As the coaching carousel continues to spin, fans are left wondering who will be the next big name to join or leave their current teams. One thing is certain: the college football world is always full of surprises.","Controversies Rock College Sports World

A series of high-profile incidents has highlighted the complexities and challenges faced by college sports teams. One such case involves a female coach taking on a male coaching role, sparking debate about sexism and meritocracy.

The decision to appoint a woman as head coach for a one-game stint has been met with criticism from some quarters, who claim it is a publicity stunt. However, university officials have denied this, citing the coach's extensive experience and qualifications.

Meanwhile, another controversy has erupted over the firing of a football coach by his university president. The incident involved a physical altercation between the coach and an opposing player, leading to the coach's dismissal.

In another development, two prominent college coaches have been embroiled in scandals. One was accused of domestic violence after an incident involving his wife, while the other was found guilty of misusing prescription drugs.

The sports world has also seen a rise in incidents involving athletes and their coaches. In one case, a female athlete's alleged assault on her husband sparked a heated debate about accountability and responsibility.

In response to these incidents, some college officials have taken steps to address concerns about player safety and well-being. One such initiative involves the end of courtesy calls between police and university coaches regarding athlete incidents.

dnc acronym meaning changed to democratic nationwide criminals. its been proven! james o’keefe’s project veritas has really done it this time. their undercover reporting is exposing the malicious attacks on our electoral system that are a massive web of criminality employed on a daily basis targeting the american people and our rights to choose our leaders. it’s business as usual for the democrat party. they have revealed a sophisticated covert voter and election fraud operation that is being run illegally and immorally all across this nation by the corrupt democrats. the security breaches that obama, clinton and the democrats were “so concerned about,” the ones supposedly originating with the russians, pale in comparison to what they are themselves doing to corrupt the electoral process. the hacks on the dnc and clinton are a revelation of what they were actually doing. if it’s wrong they’re responsible, don’t nuke the messenger or use it as a premise for world war lll. excuse us if we don’t get too upset that treason by our pretend ‘president’ and his henchmen were exposed by someone. what is important is that the truth gets out, not so much who leaked it. the corruption that threatens america was in the acts of the democrats, not in those who obtained the data. it is the democrats who are attacking the sanctity of our electoral process. hacks that exposed what the democrats were already doing are nothing compared to what project veritas reveals here. the

Article 1 - woman to coach men, for a game
the decision by phillips to make herself head coach tonight has not come without criticism. in a column yesterday in the nashville city paper, ed atlas said the move ''smacks of a publicity stunt.'' ultimately, atlas wrote, ''her presence on the sideline will be a folksy footnote to a forgettable season.'' university officials denied that any publicity stunt was involved, saying that atlas was a former sports publicist at tennessee state who had been fired by phillips. ''she is not doing this for the publicity,'' dr. james a. hefner, the university president, said in an interview. ''teresa believes there's not another coach with the experience she has for this one-game coaching stint. teresa is not a person who says, 'i want to make history in that light.' she's not that type.'' as tennessee state's women's basketball coach from 1989 to 2000, phillips accumulated a record of 150-151, twice led her teams to the n.c.a.a. tournament and in 1990 was named national coach of the year. including a previous stint coaching at fisk university, her career record is 212-189. phillips said she decided to coach to avoid putting chris graves, a second-year assistant to lewis, in a potentially awkward situation. ''if it was a difficult game, i didn't want the young man to have that hanging over him,'' she said.

The Pac-12 Conference is abuzz with excitement as two top-ranked teams, Washington and Utah, prepare to face off in a highly anticipated matchup. The undefeated Huskies, led by quarterback Jake Browning, are looking to keep their winning streak alive against the Utes, who have been on a roll themselves.

Washington has been one of the most impressive stories in college football this season, with Browning leading the charge. The young quarterback has 26 touchdowns and is considered a Heisman candidate. Utah, meanwhile, has been fueled by the strong play of running back Joe Williams, who has rushed for over 500 yards combined in the past two weeks.

The matchup between Washington and Utah is being billed as a potential preview of the Pac-12 Championship Game. Both teams are atop their respective divisions and have been dominating opponents all season. The game will be played at Utah's home stadium, where they have not lost since November last year.

This week's AP Top 25 rankings saw some significant shifts, with Clemson and Oklahoma trading spots in the top three. Alabama remains the top-ranked team, followed closely by Clemson and Oklahoma State. Washington State moved up to seventh in the rankings after a strong performance against Oregon.

In other news, the Pac-12 Conference Championship is expected to be a battle between Washington and Utah. The conference has been on fire this season, with several teams making significant strides. However, the absence of USC, who are ineligible for the championship due to NCAA sanctions, may affect the overall quality of the competition.

As the college football season heats up, fans can expect more thrilling matchups like the one between Washington and Utah. With top-ranked teams competing against each other, the stakes are high, and the excitement is palpable.","College Football Playoff Rankings Take Shape

The College Football Playoff (CFP) selection committee released its second rankings of the season, and the top four teams remain unchanged. Alabama, Clemson, and Michigan hold the top three spots, with Washington moving into fourth place.

Washington's convincing 45-17 victory over Arizona State has boosted their playoff hopes, but they still face an uphill battle to secure a spot in the four-team field. The Huskies must win out, including a victory at Washington State, to stay in contention.

Meanwhile, other top teams are facing uncertainty. UConn, which was expected to be a national title contender, has struggled this season and could be projected as a No. 8 or No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

The Pac-12 Conference is also taking shape, with Washington and Utah setting the stage for the new conference. The Huskies' convincing win over Utah has solidified their position as a top contender, but they still face stiff competition from other teams in the division.

As the season enters its final stretch, teams are fighting for every point. A loss by Michigan to Iowa could impact their playoff chances, while Washington State's victory over Colorado has put them in contention for the Pac-12 North title.

The CFP selection committee will continue to monitor team performances and make adjustments as needed.

(before it's news) follow eatdrinkandsleepfootball.com: on twitter | on facebook before i go into the team by team on the afc north, i wanted to draw an analogy first. most savvy sports fans know that only once since the ncaa college basketball tournament expanded to 64 teams has all four no. 1 seeds made it to the final four, and on average, only two top seeds make it. so, in putting brackets together, you can take the chalk and get about half the final four. personally, i’ve never picked all four no. 1 seeds – i always try to find those under-the-radar teams that are better than expected. see the tournament, just like every game, is an immensely complex event; and the nfl is no different. it’s that level of uncertainty that makes it interesting and every year in the nfl there are surprise teams. what hasn’t been surprising is the stability of the steelers and the ravens atop the afc north, however this year, i’m predicting some disruption to that division. for more nfl, fantasy football and nfl draft news and opinion, visit eatdrinkandsleepfootball.com. source:

Article 1 - playoff rankings: washington takes over playoff position
washington moved into fourth in the college football playoff rankings, putting the four remaining unbeaten teams from the power five conferences at the top of the selection committee's second top 25. alabama , clemson and michigan still hold the top three spots. the committee's first ranking of the season caused a bit of a stir because the unbeaten huskies were behind texas a&m last week. the aggies then went out and lost at mississippi state to clear up the mini-controversy. ohio state is behind washington at fifth. ""it was a small margin between no. 4 and no. 5,"" committee chairman kirby hocutt said. hocutt, who is the athletic director at texas tech, said last week that a&m was ahead of washington because of the aggies' superior schedule strength. that left open the possibility that ohio state would jump the huskies for the same reason after the buckeyes pounded nebraska on saturday. hocutt said a big difference was a&m's only loss was to alabama whereas ohio state's one loss was to 10th-ranked penn state. ""but more than anything it's the consistency that we've seen week in and week out with washington,"" hocutt said. the buckeyes are still in fine shape. ohio state plays michigan on nov. 26 in a game that could decide the big ten's east division. louisville moved up a spot to sixth, followed by wisconsin at seven

Article 3 - uncertainty at uconn
uconn’s two wins this week at madison square garden seemingly salvaged this bizarre season, in which connecticut went from a national title favorite to the country’s biggest underachiever to a team just good enough to stumble into the n.c.a.a. tournament after losing 9 of 12 games over one stretch. but pity the no. 1 seed that sees uconn across from it in the second round of the tournament, as the huskies could be projected to be a no. 8 or a no. 9 seed. the only other teams with more than one projected n.b.a. lottery pick are north carolina and kentucky. the huskies certainly have their believers beyond n.b.a. general managers who are salivating over lamb and drummond. photo “i think connecticut is a really good team; i would be shocked if they don’t win two games in the n.c.a.a. tournament at the minimum,” syracuse coach jim boeheim said. whenever and wherever the final buzzer sounds — be it next week in the first round or at the final four in new orleans — that is when the huskies will turn into college basketball’s most watched drama. drummond, a 6-foot-10 freshman center, and lamb, a 6-5 sophomore shooting wing, are expected to enter the n.b.a. draft. and those expectations came long before the huskies were banned from the 2013

in the final home game of his washington career, kevin king gave the huskies the jolt they needed. the cornerback's one-handed interception was so good, even the officials were asking where it ranked. ""the ref asked me that where that ranked. in my mind it's like (no.) 5 or 6, but in reality it's no. 1 for sure,"" king said. king's second-quarter interception awakened the slumbering huskies, and quarterback jake browning went on to throw for 338 yards and two touchdowns and no. 7 washington routed arizona state 44-18 on saturday night to stay in the college football playoff mix. washington's victory sets up one of the biggest apple cup's ever friday in pullman against washington state with the winner claiming the pac-12 north title and a spot in the conference title game. the two are tied on top of the north division standings after washington state's 38-24 loss at colorado on saturday.

Title: no. 20 usc at no. 4 washington game pick, prediction, line: upset in seattle?
Content: 11m ago • 2 min read it came a week later than expected, but on tuesday night when the college football playoff selection committee released their latest rankings, washington had entered the top four. it's validation for what the huskies have accomplished so far this season, but being ranked this early is one thing. staying there is something else entirely. we won't have to wait long to see the huskies tested, as they host a usc team that's played well over the last month. washington storyline : as mentioned above, washington is now ranked in the top four, though it needed help to get there. the huskies were ranked no. 5 in the cfp's original rankings, behind a texas a&m team that had already suffered a loss. sportsline more sportsline this was an indication that, while the committee was impressed with what the huskies had done, their resume still wasn't all that impressive. wins over oregon and stanford would have been a lot more impressive had either of those teams been the teams we thought they'd be coming into the year, but that's just not the way it worked out. now, for the first time this year, washington has a chance to pick up a win against a team the committee actually has ranked. it won't be the most impressive win in the country, but if washington can pick it up, it will only improve their position in that hotel room where playoff bids are decided. usc storyline : there was plenty of skepticism about usc's decision to stick with interim coach clay helton following last season, and at the beginning of the season, it seemed well-founded. the trojans tripped out of the opening gate, losing three of their first four. if there was any consolation, it was that two of the losses came to alabama and utah, both of whom remain ranked by the committee. things have picked up since that slow start, as the trojans have won five in a row, including a win over division-leading colorado. it's that win that makes the trojans dangerous going forward. they're still alive in the pac-12 title race, and if they can pick up an upset win over the huskies on saturday, it will give this team plenty of momentum heading down the stretch. game pick : usc +7.5 . i don't know if usc will win this game outright, but i believe it can, and that makes me lean toward taking the trojans and the points. washington has been very good at home this season, winning by an average of 32.3 points per game in their three home contests against power five teams. still, over the last month, a washington run defense that had been stellar to start the season has begun to spring some leaks, and the huskies also lost linebacker joe mathis for the rest of the season. he has been the most disruptive force

College Football Playoff Rankings Take Shape

The College Football Playoff (CFP) selection committee released its second rankings of the season, and the top four teams remain unchanged. Alabama, Clemson, and Michigan hold the top three spots, with Washington moving into fourth place.

Washington's convincing 45-17 victory over Arizona State has boosted their playoff hopes, but they still face an uphill battle to secure a spot in the four-team field. The Huskies must win out, including a victory at Washington State, to stay in contention.

Meanwhile, other top teams are facing uncertainty. UConn, which was expected to be a national title contender, has struggled this season and could be projected as a No. 8 or No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

The Pac-12 Conference is also taking shape, with Washington and Utah setting the stage for the new conference. The Huskies' convincing win over Utah has solidified their position as a top contender, but they still face stiff competition from other teams in the division.

As the season enters its final stretch, teams are fighting for every point. A loss by Michigan to Iowa could impact their playoff chances, while Washington State's victory over Colorado has put them in contention for the Pac-12 North title.

The CFP selection committee will continue to monitor team performances and make adjustments as needed. With several games remaining, the landscape of college football is still fluid, but one thing is certain: only a few teams will make it to the

The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, provides accurate information about John Boehner's background, his role as a congressman, and his advocacy for fiscal responsibility.

Therefore, I am confident that the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is the most similar to the article in question, both in style and content.","Washington D.C. - In a historic moment, John Boehner was sworn in as the 61st Speaker of the House, surrounded by friends, family, and supporters who traveled from across Ohio to witness the occasion.

Boehner's journey to the top was nothing short of remarkable, with many considering him an unlikely candidate for the position. However, his determination, charisma, and ability to connect with people have made him a beloved figure in Washington D.C.

Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Herman Cain is making waves as a dark horse candidate for the presidency. With a unique blend of business, banking, and rocket science experience, Cain is drawing attention from voters looking for a fresh face in politics.

In contrast, Tom Hayden, a prominent left-wing activist and lawmaker, has passed away at 76 after a long battle with illness. Hayden was known for his tireless advocacy for civil rights and progressive causes, earning him a reputation as a thorn in the side of powerful politicians.

As the nation grapples with economic uncertainty, some are calling for drastic spending cuts to get the country back on track. John Boehner has been a vocal advocate for fiscal responsibility, citing the need for significant cuts in government spending to avoid further debt.

In other news, Chase Bank has apologized to an innocent man who was wrongly accused of forgery and spent five days in jail. The bank has taken steps to rectify the situation and prevent similar errors from happening in the future.

Finally, Rep. Aaron Schock has compared his struggles with those of former President Abraham Lincoln, citing the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity. Despite facing numerous challenges, including a series of scandals, Schock remains committed to serving his constituents.

These are just a few of the stories making headlines as Washington D.C. continues to navigate the complexities of politics and governance.","In the world of politics, a little-known crusader has been making waves. As a director of a nonprofit organization, this individual has been providing crucial data to lawmakers, shedding light on the impact of tax policies on different segments of society.

Their work has been instrumental in shaping the debate, with figures such as Senator Kent Conrad and Senator John Kerry citing their research in Senate hearings. The numbers are stark: the wealthiest 1 percent would receive 33.5 percent of the benefits, while the bottom 60 percent would get only 15.3 percent.

Meanwhile, on another front, a labor leader who played a pivotal role in shaping America's workforce has passed away at 92. Victor Reuther was a key figure in the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, and his legacy continues to inspire workers' rights advocates.

In the medical field, Robert Ross left an indelible mark on education. His innovative approach to medical school led to the establishment of programs that provided affordable healthcare to underserved communities.

Historians are also taking a closer look at the Alamo, reevaluating the myths surrounding this pivotal event in American history. A new novel is shedding light on the complexities of the era, highlighting the human stories behind the legends.

In television, Milo Radulovich's groundbreaking work helped expose Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist tactics, paving the way for future journalists to tackle sensitive topics.

Academia is also seeing a resurgence in the art of writing research papers. Scholars are rediscovering the value of in-depth analysis and critical thinking, as students submit their work for peer review.

As the spotlight shines on Mormonism, scholars like Professor Bushman are being called upon to provide context and insights into this complex faith. Meanwhile, aviation pioneers like Robert N. Buck continue to inspire new generations of pilots.

In politics, a congressman's rise to power is marked by a memoir that reflects on his journey from humble beginnings to becoming a leader in Congress. His story serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and vision.

Article 1 - little-known crusader plays a big role in tax debate
this is where mr. mcintyre, director of a nonprofit, nonpartisan, shoestring operation called citizens for tax justice, comes in. when senator kent conrad, democrat of north dakota, stood on the senate floor last thursday with charts showing that the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would get 33.5 percent of the benefits from the bill and that the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would get only 15.3 percent, the numbers were mr. mcintyre's. when senator john kerry, democrat of massachusetts, told the senate finance committee on tuesday that 6 million families with 10 million children would get nothing from the bill, those figures, too, were mr. mcintyre's. mr. mcintyre estimates that he has produced 150 spreadsheets in the last month alone. ''what i can add to the debate is to get people information -- in congress, on the staffs, in the press -- so they can know what's going on, and then they can evaluate the policies,'' he said over lunch at d.c. coast, the nicest restaurant within three blocks of his office, and one he had never visited. for democrats, his work has been indispensable. ''i don't know what we'd do without bob mcintyre,'' mr. conrad said. ''the agencies of government that are supposed to provide this information don't, and the only way we can get it is from bob

Article 2 - victor reuther, influential labor leader, dies at 92
walter reuther, who was also a power in the american federation of labor-congress of industrial organizations, was president of the u.a.w. from 1946 until his death in a plane crash in 1970. roy reuther was the union's political representative and legislative director; he died in 1968. victor reuther honed his activism as an orator and an organizer of sit-down strikers. he shaped the union's educational programs throughout the country, establishing labor institutes, radio and film production units and the union's own drama schools and summer camps. later, from 1955 until his retirement in 1972, he was director of the union's international affairs department in washington, while also supervising legislative affairs as head of the washington office. in his book ''the brothers reuther and the story of the u.a.w.: a memoir'' (houghton mifflin, 1976), he recalled the often bloody confrontations of earlier times. ''during his years as a trade union activist,'' mr. gettelfinger, the union's president, said yesterday, ''victor displayed great personal courage and endured great personal risk for the right of workers to organize. he faced tear gas and billy clubs during the u.a.w. organizational campaigns of the 1930's, and was a victim of an assassination attempt in 1949.'' on that occasion, mr. reuther and his wife, sophia, had

Article 4 - the alamo remembered but transformed
this tension between mythology and revisionism meant that mr. harrigan's novel would require as much historical research as imagination. determined to provide a ''cold splash of reality,'' he repeatedly interviewed experts: stephen l. hardin, the historian, and thomas ricks lindleyan, an independent scholar. he pored over old medical journals, military manuals and records of the mexican government. from diaries he picked up period expressions like ''well, if that don't take the dilapidated linen!'' ultimately, and not surprisingly, he discovered that many of the old myths he had learned as a child were not true. perhaps the most famous alamo story is of travis gathering his men inside the besieged garrison, informing them that reinforcements were not coming and drawing a line in the sand with his sword and challenging his men to cross it and fight to the death for freedom. it is a stirring anecdote but one considered a fabrication by many modern alamo scholars. ''that moment to me is the linchpin of the alamo myth,'' he said. ''once that is gone and once that idea of deliberate self-sacrifice is gone, the alamo story becomes a human story and not a mythological one. you realize these guys were not intent on dying, they were intent on living.'' one problem in plotting a novel around the real events of the alamo is that the end is something of downer: everyone dies. to navigate this,

fred w. friendly, producer of the program, called it “the first time any of us appreciated the power of television.” in 2005, the episode became a big part of a hit movie about mr. murrow and his cbs colleagues, “good night, and good luck.” mr. radulovich was a consultant for the film and appeared in original clips from the program. the radulovich broadcast was the first salvo that “see it now” fired against senator joseph r. mccarthy, republican of wisconsin, and his anti-communist tactics. although the case of mr. radulovich did not involve mccarthy, and the senator was not mentioned in relation to him, two later “see it now” programs dealt directly with mccarthy. in 1998, the state bar of michigan honored the program about mr. radulovich with a plaque that reads, “it is generally believed that the program was the beginning of the end for the mccarthy era.” photo milo john radulovich was born in detroit on oct. 28, 1926. his father, john, a serbian immigrant, was an autoworker. milo was an aviation cadet at what was then michigan state college before joining the army air forces in 1944 and becoming a meteorologist. he did top-secret work in greenland and was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1952. he then attended

Article 6 - journal showcases dying art of the research paper
the term paper was once an important feature of american secondary education, requiring students to dig deeply and write at length. mr. fitzhugh said that most public school teachers have stopped assigning such papers — a shift that he attributed mostly to the fact that teachers have so many students and so little time. still, hundreds of earnest students send mr. fitzhugh papers every year, hoping to win his stamp of approval. in the most recent issue, a senior from montclair, n.j., writes of theodore roosevelt’s tenure as a new york police commissioner; a new orleans student profiles a 19th-century transcendentalist philosopher; and a senior from seoul documents the oppression of korean residents on a north pacific island. pamela ban was a junior at thomas worthington high school in ohio when mr. fitzhugh picked her paper on chinese economic reform for the summer 2008 issue. researching it as an independent study project with her teacher, mark mccort, ms. ban said, was a transformative learning experience. but it puzzled her classmates. “they were in disbelief, like, ‘why would you want to do more work like that?’ ” said ms. ban, who now studies applied math and economics at harvard. mr. fitzhugh, a harvard graduate himself, taught history for a decade at concord-carlisle high school in massachusetts. when he started teaching in 1977, he was advised by colleagues

Article 7 - scholar becomes chief explainer in a ‘mormon moment’
now, with the presidential candidacy of mitt romney (whom professor bushman knew when both were at harvard in the ’70s and whose son is a member of professor bushman’s new york congregation), professor bushman is being thrust further into the public spotlight, becoming the nation’s chief defender and explainer of mormonism. when the new republic published a cover article in january questioning whether a mormon was fit to be president, the magazine asked professor bushman to write a “mormon” response. at the pew forum on religion & public life’s journalism conference in may, professor bushman was asked to lead a session titled “mormonism and democratic politics: are they compatible?” and as news media outlets run stories about the current “mormon moment,” his phone keeps ringing. he considered it a blessing that he was already on his way out of new york for his annual summerlong sojourn in provo, utah, when “good morning america” and “the daily show” started calling. “i’m still kind of a babe in the woods when it comes to tv,” professor bushman, 76, said from provo, where he is joined by his wife, claudia, who has also taught at columbia and has written books on mormonism with him. and yet he says his stomach for so many media appearances, answering the same questions over and over, is born of duty to his

Article 8 - robert n. buck dies at 93; was record-setting aviator
in april 1930, at 16, mr. buck became the youngest licensed pilot in the united states. later that year, flying from newark to los angeles, he broke the junior transcontinental airspeed record. on the return trip, just for sport, he broke it again. at 17, he wrote a book about it, “burning up the sky,” published by g. p. putnam’s sons in 1931. by the time he was 18, mr. buck had set 14 junior aviation records. these included the junior altitude record for light planes, which he broke in july 1930 by ascending to 15,000 feet. (in 1936, mr. buck, flying with a cousin, would set a world distance record for light planes, flying nonstop from burbank, calif., to columbus, ohio — 1,986 miles — in a lambert monocoupe.) red-haired and apple-cheeked, the young mr. buck was known in the papers as “the schoolboy pilot.” they chronicled his every exploit, including what he carried in his plane (a bible and a package of sandwiches made by his mother) and his life on the ground (“he likes polo, hunting, riding and milk drinking,” the new york telegram reported in 1931). robert nietzel buck was born on jan. 29, 1914, in elizabethport, n.j., and

Article 9 - a congressman’s rise, twice-told tales and a fabled gateway
from his harlem apartment, mr. rangel can see his grandfather’s brownstone on west 132nd street and lenox avenue, but, in many respects, he has come a long way; this year, he was made chairman of the powerful house ways and means committee. despite this achievement, his book mostly looks back, barely touching on his unfinished political agenda, which, perhaps, befits a memoir by a man who is almost 77. he recalls the response of a former congressional colleague, claude pepper, who was about the same age as mr. rangel is now when a broker was urging him to make some long-term investment. to which mr. pepper replied: “young man, at my age, i don’t even buy green bananas.” mr. pepper, by the way, served in congress until his death — at nearly 89. • until 1910, only one railroad provided direct access to manhattan: commodore vanderbilt’s new york central, which snaked along the hudson from upstate. all the others dead-ended in new jersey, where passengers were forced to transfer to ferries to reach the city. in “conquering gotham: a gilded age epic: the construction of penn station and its tunnels” (viking adult, $27.95), jill jonnes, whose works include a book about the south bronx, offers a readable and human account of how a few visionaries from the penn

i wouldn’t listen to him and even wrote an article titled “che dan.” i put quote marks around “dan” to separate the characters. [combined, the two characters can mean “speaking nonsense.” separated they mean “speaking of a low season.”] i was speaking about a low season for the arts. following the meeting, there were fewer works reflecting reality and criticizing official privilege. i wrote that this had something to do with the meeting. in 1985, i was chosen to be director of the people’s arts theater in shanghai. but if you want to be director of the people’s arts theater, you have to be a party member. i wasn’t a party member. i submitted my application. but the city authorities wouldn’t approve it. they accused me of attacking hu yaobang. “hu yaobang said kind words to you. and you said he was speaking nonsense!” some party members at the theater then wrote to hu yaobang about this matter. comrade yaobang wrote back on the letter “if this comrade is qualified, he should be allowed to join the party.” this solved everything. and he said of “speaking of a low season” that no one should make connections between the article and him. he was truly liberal-minded. back then i had a very shallow understanding of comrade yaobang. but my views on politics and society have deepened. looking back, i think he was truly great. photo

Title: on “long journey” from reading to congress, boehner still the same guy
Content: (before it's news) the cincinnati enquirer highlighted congressman boehner’s “long journey from reading, ohio to the u.s. capitol” where he’s leading the fight to create new jobs, cut government spending, and change the way congress works. according to the enquirer, friends and colleagues say he’s the same guy he’s always been: “…boehner is a native of working-class reading, one of 12 children from a catholic family who grew up in a five-bedroom, one-bathroom home on hill street. “long before he crusaded for tax cuts, he was a football player for gerry faust’s moeller high school crusaders. “after a short stint in the u.s. navy in 1969 – boehner was discharged after less than three months because of a bad back – he worked odd jobs, including as a bartender, roofer and a janitor before attending xavier, where he almost quit until a respected accounting professor intervened. … “graduating from xavier, boehner worked as a salesman at nucite sales, a marketing firm for packaging and plastics manufacturers. he bought the company and became president, a job he held until he joined congress and house ethics rules forced him to resign. … “he is also a man, friends and colleagues in state say, who hasn’t changed much since his reading days, at least in private. “high school friend and teammate jerry vanden eynden said he is bothered by the portrayal of boehner as a rich elitist. “‘if we needed a dollar for gas, our dads didn’t give it to us,’ he said. ‘we had to go work for it…people don’t realize that about him.’”

The tech sector is seeing a surge in optimism, with analysts raising price targets for several major players. Deutsche Bank has upgraded its target on Apple to $600, citing strong demand for the company's products.

Meanwhile, in the energy space, Cameco has responded to Hathor's rejection of its $520 million takeover bid by claiming that Hathor overstated the value of its key Roughrider deposit. The junior uranium explorer cited lower costs compared to established mines operating in the Athabasca Basin.

In other news, Casimir Capital has raised its price target on Yoho Resources to $4.50 from $4.25, driven by solid second-quarter results and improved pricing and mix. The oil and natural gas company's production was in line with expectations, and funds flow exceeded forecasts.

On the stock market, Mattel, Inc. (MAT) achieved a new 52-week high price of $31.49, up 4.98% from its opening price. The toy products manufacturer designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of products worldwide.

However, not all is rosy in the tech sector. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner deliveries are facing challenges due to Japan's earthquake and subsequent rolling blackouts, which may impact the availability of key sub-modules. This could lead to delays and potential parts shortages.

In other news, Kingold Jewelry (KGJI) has upsized and priced its underwritten public offering of common stock at $3.19 per share. The company announced a strong first day of trading after its initial public offering.

(before it's news) uranium giant cameco (tse:cco) (nyse:ccj) responded late wednesday to hathor’s rejection of its $$520 million takeover bid earlier this morning, claiming hathor overstated the value of the company’s key roughrider deposit. on tuesday, hathor, which was offered $$3.75 per share from cameco, released a preliminary economic assessment for roughrider, which is located in the uranium-rich athabasca basin of saskatchewan. this morning, hathor rejected cameco’s $$520 million bid, calling it too low. in a press release, the junior uranium explorer said that based on a mill output of 5.0 million pounds of uranium oxide per year, total mine and mill production costs would be $$14.44 per pound. this compares to cash cost forecasts for cameco’s cigar lake and mcarthur river uranium deposits of $$23.14 per pound and $$19.69 per pound, respectively. cameco called the cost estimate for roughrider “unreasonably low” when compared to established mines operating in the athabasca basin for many years. “despite significantly lower grades, hathor’s pa suggests that roughrider can produce uranium at a much lower cost than mcarthur river”, considered by many to

Article 4 - yoho resources price target raised by casimir capital
yoho resources price target raised by casimir capital % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) yoho resources (cve:yo) was upgraded on wednesday, with casimir capital analyst ryan galloway boosting his price target of the company to $$4.50 from $$4.25 previously driven by a blend of an updated net asset value forecast for the year. in a research note released this afternoon, the analyst said second quarter results from yoho were solid, with production in line with expectations, and improvements to pricing and mix boosting cash flow. the oil and natural gas company, with activities in western canada, averaged 2,481 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), in line with casimir’s production estimate of 2,513 boe/d, but product mix and liquids pricing both beat predicitions, helping to drive funds flow to $$4.1 million versus a $$3.3 million forecast. yoho also updated its full year output guidance to 2,500 boe/d, down slightly from february’s 2,700 to 2,800 boe/d outlook, accounting for updated timings of well tie-ins, and anticipated downtime from the semcams ka gas plant turnaround, the company said. current capacity exceeds 3,100 boe/d and should average 2,500 boe/d for calendar second quarter, including turnarounds, galloway wrote.

Article 6 - buy, sell or hold: japan’s disaster will create more turbulence for the boeing co. (nyse: ba)
boeing spent the last decade designing and building the next generation in commercial aircraft. the 787 dreamliner was designed to carry passengers farther distances, in greater comfort, while consuming less fuel. it incorporates a significant number of new technologies into its design. however, the challenge of incorporating these technologies has caused boeing to miss deadline after deadline. in fact, the current test aircraft caught fire during a test flight last fall and had to make an emergency landing. the 9.0 earthquake in japan is the latest event to adversely affect boeing’s schedule of dreamliner deliveries. japan is a major supplier of key sub-modules for the airplane. these parts are built in japan, and shipped to america for final assembly. it is an understatement to say that japan will be busy rebuilding its damaged infrastructure for quite a while. the rolling blackouts will most likely keep some of the highest technology off line, until guaranteed supplies are available. boeing subcontractors are already speaking to the media about how they will be affected by availability of gasoline, among other things. “there is the potential for future parts shortages with a small number of suppliers related to their sub-tiers suppliers and/or infrastructure impacts,” doug alder, a spokesman for chicago-based boeing, recently told marketwatch. “we are working through each of these risks and developing plans to mitigate their impact.” considering the continual slippage in the 787 dreamliner, there is no reason to believe that boeing will be able to start

Article 8 - stock of the week – el pollo loco (loco)
if you look closely at their financials they have not been able to churn a profit until recently. this is mainly due to the ‘loss on early extinguishment of debt’ amounting to costs of $21.5m and $20.1m in 2013 and 2011 respectively. when el pollo loco refinanced their debt, it was replaced with senior secured credit facilities that carry longer maturities, but had lower interest rates. as a result of the refinancing, call premiums and write-off of deferred financing costs and accelerated accretion charges were incurred. having taken this into account, el pollo loco would’ve had a net profit of approximately $5m and -$12m in fy 2013 and fy 2011 respectively. highlight technicals from a technical perspective, from el pollo loco’s initial public offering at $15 it is without a doubt that it has doubled since ipo . now the general public, myself included evidently did not have the change to buy it at $15. but it was at 18.48 on the first day. honestly, that gap up on monday after the first day of trading on friday should have been a green light. if you had traded that gap up you would be up a significant amount. technically speaking, i always like to wait for a pullback to the 61.8% fib extension. especially if its the first pullback. but, it looks like the stock is strong

A recent incident involving President Obama has raised concerns about the government's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf Coast. The president was spotted swimming with his daughter in a bay, despite the ongoing environmental disaster. Critics argue that this move was insensitive and potentially reckless, as it may have exposed the family to toxic metals and other pollutants.

Meanwhile, reports are emerging of unusual sea life in the area. Whales and dolphins have been spotted in the oil, while dead sea cucumbers and other invertebrates have been found floating on the surface. Experts warn that these sightings could be indicative of a larger problem with the environmental impact of the spill.

In other news, a Norwegian sailor has run into trouble again off the coast of Antarctica. The sailor was attempting to travel to the South Pole without proper permits or insurance, and was later fined for his actions.

Additionally, a kayaking guide has claimed that the Amazon River may not have been fully explored, with some sources suggesting that its true source is located on a remote mountain in Peru. This discovery could potentially rewrite the record books on the first descent of the river.

In related news, a Reuters report has contradicted White House claims about President Obama's activities on August 4th last year. The report suggests that the photo released by the White House may have been doctored or staged.

Finally, Canadian authorities have repelled an invasion of U.S. floaters who had drifted across the border from Michigan during high winds on the St. Clair River. The incident highlights concerns about international cooperation and environmental protection.

As these incidents highlight, the Gulf Coast is still reeling from the effects of the oil spill, while other regions are grappling with their own environmental challenges.","Rescue Efforts Underway as Sinking Fishing Boat Off Massachusetts Coast Claims Six Lives

A 72-foot fishing boat, the Captain Jeff, sank off the coast of southeastern Massachusetts on Sunday morning, leaving six people stranded in the water. The vessel was en route to New Bedford from a fishing trip when it began taking on water.

Coast Guard officials and local authorities responded quickly to the distress call, with multiple boats and a helicopter dispatched to the scene. Despite efforts to remove water from the boat, it was deemed too late, and the vessel sank in high seas.

The six people rescued were taken aboard nearby vessels for medical attention. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among those rescued.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a devastating wave struck the coast of Sri Lanka, claiming over 4,500 lives. The disaster was exacerbated by years of civil war, which had left the country's infrastructure severely strained.

In Washington D.C., President Bush has nominated several officials to key positions in his administration. William S. Farish, a wealthy horse breeder and longtime friend of the Bush family, is expected to be appointed Ambassador to Britain.

As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, efforts are underway to rebuild the New York Aquarium. The new facility will feature interactive exhibits focused on environmental conservation, including displays on shark-fin trade and ocean pollution.

In a separate development, a historic presidential yacht has been assigned to the White House, becoming the fifth in U.S. history. The USS Sequoia is set to be based at the Washington Navy Yard.

As the search for two missing American sailors continues off the coast of Iraq, officials are working to uncover the truth behind their disappearance. The incident occurred when the sailors boarded a ship suspected of carrying oil from Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions.

In other news, a group of charter fishermen in a marina were tasked with securing boats and cleats during a severe storm. Despite the challenging conditions, they remained vigilant, waiting for the storm to pass.

Article 1 - “mission accomplished” on the gulf coast
“mission accomplished” on the gulf coast (before it's news) it’s a nervous sasha being held by president obama in a back bay, alligator bay, in panama city, on august 14th. obama, beaming with reassurance with a wide smile, leads his not so sure daughter into a surf-less back bay, and uncharted waters: just where is the oil and dispersant, and how much has the government and bp continued spraying of the corexit. that obama would use his daughter in that manner to earn political points is reprehensible. using her to swim in a back bay, away from the direct spill impacts, then encouraging others to swim in gulf waters, and eat seafood from gulf waters, waters he wasn’t willing to take his daughter into, is equally reprehensible. what is of equal concern is that the president of the united states doesn’t seem to understand the rain cycle. various independent testing has shown the elevated toxic metal levels in our rain water since the gulf oil disaster; toxic rainwater no doubt impacting those bodies of water and land near the gulf coast. it is quite likely that he and his daughter were indeed swimming in waters impacted by the oil disaster indirectly. that swim event was a new low for the obama administration, in a season of lows since the spill began. even as the obama administration has revamped the deepwater horizon website, now dubbing the site restorethegulf.gov,

mystery creature godzilla ? captured by google earth % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) mystery creature captured by google earth too big to be a shark and too fast for a whale… so what is the mystery creature captured by google earth off the coast of new zealand. a giant mystery sea creature is thought to have been spotted in the turquoise waters of one of new zealand’s most idyllic bays. a huge unexplained wake can be seen in a google earth image of oke bay, in the bay of islands, an area on the east coast of the far north district of the country’s north island, captured by satellite at about 11.30am on january 30. engineer pita witehira, who spotted the wake while on google earth researching for his holiday home, told daily mail australia the wake could have been left by a creature around 12 metres in size. mr witehira, from hamilton, new zealand, said: ‘the native maori would call this a “taniwha” (‘troll’) as it appears not to be a whale and it is far too big to be a shark. it is moving too fast and turning too sharply to be a whale.’ mr witehira also ruled out that a boat was the cause of the wake because there is no white froth like normal wakes created by motors. ‘i spotted it

Article 3 - ship cruises across wave only to be greeted by 100-foot surprise straight from horror film
hollywood disaster and horror films use some of the best special effects out there. while many of the things that appear on the big screen could never happen in real life, nature occasionally imitates film and shows what it is truly capable of. a video from 2016 of a ship in the north sea holds one of those moments. in the video, the ship sailed through massive waves, including a “100 foot wave” that crashed right onto the deck. the ship survived the entire ordeal, but the footage of the incident looks like something straight out of a hollywood horror (or disaster) film. the sheer size of the waves that the ship went through is enough to make you never want to go traveling the ocean. it is unclear how exactly the measurement of “100 feet” was created. the title of the video is “100 foot wave hits ship,” but there is no way to actually verify the wave was 100 feet high. however, from watching the video that doesn’t really matter. that wave was huge! the man who was recording the entire thing (from the safety of a cabin) seemed to be enjoying himself, despite the obvious danger during the video, he could be heard laughing with another person who is off camera. “that’s f****** awesome!” he said at one point during the video, as a wave is crashing on the deck of the ship. you can watch the video here. warning: strong language several of the comments under the video are from people wondering

Article 4 - norwegian sailor runs into trouble in the antarctic again!
norwegian sailor runs into trouble in the antarctic again! (before it's news) remember that norwegian sailing ship called berserk that sunk off the coast of antarctica last year? the ship was operating in the southern ocean without proper permits when a major storm hit the region. three crew members lost their lives in the accident, although the captain of the vessel, jarle andhoey, was actually on the antarctic continent at the time. he and another man were attempting to travel illegally to the south pole on atv’s and were unaware of the sinking of their ship until later. when he and his companion were later rescued, andhoey faced a criminal investigation back in norway and was ultimately fined $$5000 for not having the proper permits or insurance to operate near antarctica. fast forward a year and andhoey seems to be up to his old tricks. according this story on jon bowermaster’s website, the norwegian sailor has returned to the antarctic once again this year and has once again run into trouble. as of this writing, no one has seen or heard from andhoey and his crew for nearly a week. one of the crew members did phone home to his wife using a satellite phone a few days back and reported that the ship had broken a mast and was out of diesel fuel and food, but after that there has been no direct contact with the vessel. a legal representative of andhoey later confirmed that the

Article 5 - does the amazon still remain un-paddled from source-to-sea?
does the amazon still remain un-paddled from source-to-sea? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! an interesting story showed up on the outside magazine website yesteraday. its an article that first appeared in the january issue of the print mag and is just now making its way online. in it, a white-water kayaking guide by the name of james “rocky” contos contends that the river that has been previously thought to be the source of the amazon isn’t in fact the source at all. that would mean that all previous attempts to make a first descent of the waterway were starting in the wrong place and the amazon has yet to be paddled source-to-sea. contos says that he made his discovery while using google earth to plan some new kayaking routes in peru. previously it has been assumed that the apurimac river marks the furthest starting point of the amazon, but he believes that its true source sits on the 18,363-foot (5597 meter) nevado mismi mountain, where the mantaro river begins. by contos’ estimates, the mantaro is approximately 50 miles longer than the apurimac, giving it the distinction of being the furthest source. if what contos says is true, we’ll eventually have to re-write the record books on the first descent of the river. as of right now, it hasn’t been done. at least not by

out in the oil with captain dave [the pump handle] (before it's news) <p>by elizabeth grossman</p> <p>”i’ve never seen anything like it,” says david willman, who has nearly 15 years’ experience captaining supply boats that support oil rigs and drilling platforms in the gulf of mexico. “we’re seeing pods of whales and dolphins out in the oil and lots of dead things,” he tells me. “things i’ve never seen before coming up from the deep that look like sea cucumbers floating dead. man o’ wars floating dead with shriveled tentacles.” willman is captain of the noonie g., an 111-foot supply boat owned by <a href=”http://www.guilbeaumarine.com/”>guilbeau marine</a>, a <a href=”http://207.13.191.46/news/article/feature-family-tradition/306233.aspx”>company</a> based in cut off, la. he’s been working out of venice, louisiana for about ten years ferrying fuel, water, and other supplies to offshore oil operations. </p> <p>he’s not the only one seeing oiled and dead sea life: a research team from texas a&m university out on the gulf in june also reported what looked to be hundreds of dead sea cucumbers but were actually invertebrates in the <

Article 7 - lost at sea? part 1
(before it's news) in the news, a man named louis jordan survived 66 days lost at sea off the carolina coast with little apparent physical effect. some have wondered out loud how this is possible: could it have been staged? i decided to take a closer look at why he was so successful in keeping it together when everything else fell apart. rough seas caused mr. jordan’s 35-foot sailboat to capsize in the middle of the night. wisely, he stayed with the upside-down boat which was still floating. as a result, he was able to remain near his supply of water and food, as well as some equipment, such as a fishing net. luckily for him, the boat eventually self-righted in the waves, which sailboats are designed to do. if he had been stranded in the water on an open raft or with just a life jacket, he would probably have succumbed to exposure in cold carolina waters. little physical evidence of the elements on our castaway? in a boat without power but with an intact cabin, you have shelter from the wind and sun. any normal person would know to stay inside on the open ocean in january. still, he looked almost too good for the amount of time he was out there. mr. jordan says that he rationed himself to a pint of water a day, which means he consumed more than 60 pints of water during his ordeal. how did he do it? we know that

reuters report contradicts obama ‘skeet shooting’ photo % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by paul joseph watson, faith issues a reuters report concerning barack obama’s activities on august 4th last year contradicts white house claims that the president was skeet shooting at camp david, an indication that a photo released over the weekend showing obama firing a rifle could be fraudulent. on saturday, white house communications director daniel pfeiffer tweeted out a photo showing obama clay pigeon shooting with the caption stating the image was taken, “on the range at camp david, md., saturday, aug. 4, 2012.” pfeiffer taunted that the photo was “for all the “skeeters,” in reference to those who doubted obama’s claim that he “went shooting all the time.” the image was a not-so-sophisticated attempt to portray obama as sympathetic to gun owners even as his administration is in the midst of a legislative and executive effort to eviscerate the second amendment. the white house even warned that, “the photograph may not be manipulated in any way,” in a futile attempt to prevent people from creating humorous photoshopped alternatives. however, much of the backlash has centered around speculation that the image was either doctored or that it was staged recently in a crude attempt to address the “skeeters,” similar

during the occasional hurricane there are duties still. twenty charter fishing boats were lined up along the dock on saturday, and while a handful had captains on board, most did not. even in the lashing rain, rigging had to be secured and cleat hitches tied and retied when the storm yanked the boats and loosened the lines tying them to the dock. photo it was wet work, which mr. davis performed alongside a 39-year-old former marine named j. w. slade, or lumpy to his friends. but it beat the rest of the day’s agenda, which was simply to sit and keep watch. in the middle of a howling, possibly devastating storm, this is a maddening chore. “i think what most drives people to drink is boredom,” mr. davis said. it was a wishful observation, as he had survived to that point in the day on food and water alone. the third man in the shop, a wiry 47-year-old jack of all trades named bruce trzcinski, had no such scruples, returning over the course of the afternoon to a mason jar of homemade “white lightning.” this did not affect his work ethic — actually improved it, by his own reckoning — as he volunteered for just about any task that came up. but when there were no tasks there was only the waiting. mr. trzcinski and mr. slade spent most of the afternoon trading bar

""they lied and lied and lied about everything,"" mr. kerry says in an interview in his senate office. ""how many lies do you get to tell before someone calls you a liar? how many times can you be exposed in america today?"" his supporters are compiling a dossier that they say will expose every one of the swift boat group's charges as a lie and put to rest any question about mr. kerry's valor in combat. while it would be easy to see this as part of mr. kerry's exploration of another presidential run, his friends say the swift boat charges struck at an experience so central to his identity that he would want to correct the record

Rescue Efforts Underway as Sinking Fishing Boat Off Massachusetts Coast Claims Six Lives

A 72-foot fishing boat, the Captain Jeff, sank off the coast of southeastern Massachusetts on Sunday morning, leaving six people stranded in the water. The vessel was en route to New Bedford from a fishing trip when it began taking on water.

Coast Guard officials and local authorities responded quickly to the distress call, with multiple boats and a helicopter dispatched to the scene. Despite efforts to remove water from the boat, it was deemed too late, and the vessel sank in high seas.

The six people rescued were taken aboard nearby vessels for medical attention. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among those rescued.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a devastating wave struck the coast of Sri Lanka, claiming over 4,500 lives. The disaster was exacerbated by years of civil war, which had left the country's infrastructure severely strained.

In Washington D.C., President Bush has nominated several officials to key positions in his administration. William S. Farish, a wealthy horse breeder and longtime friend of the Bush family, is expected to be appointed Ambassador to Britain.

As the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, efforts are underway to rebuild the New York Aquarium. The new facility will feature interactive exhibits focused on environmental conservation, including displays on shark-fin trade and ocean pollution.

Environmental Concerns Loom Over Gulf Coast

A recent incident involving President Obama has raised concerns about the government's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf Coast. The president was spotted swimming with his daughter in a bay, despite the ongoing environmental disaster. Critics argue that this move was insensitive and potentially reckless, as it may have exposed the family to toxic metals and other pollutants.

Meanwhile, reports are emerging of unusual sea life in the area. Whales and dolphins have been spotted in the oil, while dead sea cucumbers and other invertebrates have been found floating on the surface. Experts warn that these sightings could be indicative of a larger problem with the environmental impact of the spill.

In other news, a Norwegian sailor has run into trouble again off the coast of Antarctica. The sailor was attempting to travel to the South Pole without proper permits or insurance, and was later fined for his actions.

Additionally, a kayaking guide has claimed that the Amazon River may not have been fully explored, with some sources suggesting that its true source is located on a remote mountain in Peru. This discovery could potentially rewrite the record books on the first descent of the river.

In related news, a Reuters report has contradicted White House claims about President Obama's activities on August 4th last year. The report suggests that the photo released by the White House may have been doctored or staged.

It also mentions specific cases like Dennis Kozlowski and Angelo Mozilo, which are mentioned in the original article.  The style and content of the article ""Corporate Accountability Lacking"" is similar to the original article, as it provides a critical analysis of the corporate scandals and their impact on investors and regulators. The tone is informative and objective, providing evidence-based arguments for its claims.  In contrast, the article ""High-Profile Bankers and Executives Face Scrutiny"" appears to be sensationalized and lacks specific details about the cases mentioned. It also seems to focus more on speculation and rumors rather than providing concrete information about the scandals. Therefore, it is less similar in style and content to the original article.","High-Profile Bankers and Executives Face Scrutiny

A recent wave of resignations and departures has shaken the financial industry, with several high-profile bankers and executives facing intense scrutiny. The sudden exits of key figures at major institutions have raised eyebrows, with some speculating that central bank policymakers may be split on issues related to Greece's potential default.

Among those affected is Robert P. Kelly, CEO and Chairman of Bank of New York Mellon, who stepped down due to ""differences in approaches"" to managing the company. The timing of his departure has sparked curiosity, particularly given the growing pressure on the bank over accusations of shortchanging clients in currency trades for foreign transactions.

Meanwhile, a federal judge has revived a securities fraud lawsuit against Bank of America Corp's CEO Brian Moynihan and others, alleging they misled shareholders about the risk of buying back large amounts of soured mortgages. The lawsuit also targets former CEO Kenneth Lewis and other executives.

In another development, Dennis Duban, an accountant for James Pflueger, has been sentenced to 24 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud the IRS and assisting in filing a false federal income tax return. Duban's clients, including prominent auto dealers Charles Alan Pflueger and his father James, were also indicted on similar charges.

These high-profile cases highlight the ongoing scrutiny of financial institutions and executives, with many facing intense pressure to maintain their reputation and avoid scandal. As the industry continues to navigate complex regulatory issues, it remains to be seen how these developments will impact the market and the individuals involved.","Corporate Accountability Lacking

The recent wave of corporate scandals has left investors and regulators questioning the integrity of the financial system. The Enron affair, which exposed widespread accounting irregularities, has sparked a renewed focus on corporate accountability.

Despite high-profile resignations and settlements, many executives have escaped significant penalties for their roles in the scandals. For example, Dennis Kozlowski, former CEO of Tyco International, resigned without facing substantial consequences. Microsoft also agreed to alter its accounting practices after being accused of manipulating revenue reports.

The lack of accountability has led to a sense of unease among investors, who are increasingly skeptical of corporate claims. The ongoing trial of Arthur Andersen highlights the need for stronger auditing standards and greater independence from management.

Some argue that the current system is too lenient on executives, allowing them to reap benefits while others suffer losses. A recent settlement with Angelo Mozilo, former CEO of Countrywide Financial, has generated $1.97 billion in penalties, but most of these payments came from companies rather than individuals.

The Enron scandal also led to a re-examination of corporate governance and auditing practices. The case highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability within companies.

As regulators and lawmakers continue to grapple with the implications of these scandals, it is clear that more needs to be done to restore trust in the financial system.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - accountability for accountants
enron, tyco, adelphia, global crossing: these days, business news can resemble a financial police blotter. the erosion of credibility of many corporations continues, as the enron affair has unleashed a rash of allegations of dubious accounting practices, and of market insiders corrupted by conflicts of interest. these revelations of trouble at individual companies will continue to rattle the entire stock market so long as congress and regulators refuse to shore up safeguards against corporate chicanery. yesterday dennis kozlowski, the beleaguered chief executive of tyco international, the industrial conglomerate that has been the subject of numerous inquiries into its business practices, resigned in disgrace. microsoft agreed to alter some of its accounting practices that the securities and exchange commission claimed had been used to massage its profit reports. the software giant's behavior had more to do with its manipulation of the timing of reporting revenues than with any outright fraud. most companies, to be sure, remain honest, but it is hard for investors to be confident of this in an environment made all the more uncertain by the realization that the system's financial cops have not been on the beat. this point has been driven home by the ongoing trial of arthur andersen for its involvement in the enron demise and other allegations of improper behavior by auditors and supposedly independent boards of directors. that is why congress must act aggressively to restore the integrity of the market. on the key issue of bolstering auditors' independence, a weak reform bill passed in

Article 2 - it has a fancy name, but will it get tough?
such bars typically last five years, but some are permanent. the s.e.c.’s settlement with angelo mozilo, 73, former head of countrywide financial, barred him from acting as a director or officer of a public company for the rest of his life. some cases on the list are still being litigated. those that have been settled have generated $1.97 billion in penalties, disgorgement and other monetary relief, according to the s.e.c. harmed investors have received $355 million of that. drilling into the details, though, indicates that little of this money was paid by individuals. the payments came from companies, or more precisely, their shareholders. talk about making the wrong people pay. only one of the cases seems to involve a clawback of executive compensation. it’s the 2009 case against three former top executives of new century financial, a quintessential wild west lender. together, the three paid $1.5 million when settling charges of making false and misleading statements about the company’s soundness as it imploded. if this is justice, it’s certainly not rough. brad morrice, the company’s former chief executive, returned just $542,000 to regulators; he took home at least $2.9 million in incentive pay in the two years before new century collapsed. it seems obvious that until executives are forced to dig deep into their own pockets to pay penalties in these matters, they will be tempted to take as many risks as

Article 3 - enron&#x2019;s skilling strikes a deal for a shorter prison sentence
8:27 p.m. | updated jeffrey k. skilling, imprisoned for the last six years because of his role in the fraud that caused the collapse of enron, has reached a deal that could reduce his sentence by more than a decade. as part of the agreement with the justice department, the former chief executive of the energy giant will waive his rights to any further appeals. in addition, he has agreed to allow more than $40 million of assets that were seized from him to be distributed to victims of enron’s failure. employees lost their retirement savings and shareholders lost billions of dollars after the once highflying company slid into bankruptcy in 2001. under federal prison rules, mr. skilling — who had been sentenced to 24 years and 4 months — could leave prison as soon as 2017. the agreement is still subject to approval by judge simeon t. lake iii of federal district court in houston, who oversaw mr. skilling’s trial in 2006. though the judge has some discretion over the ultimate length of the sentence, either side can appeal if he goes outside the guidelines. a resentencing hearing has been scheduled for june 21. if approved, the pact would conclude mr. skilling’s long legal battle with the government over his role in enron’s implosion. convicted of fraud and conspiracy, the onetime enron leader, who is now 59, was the highest-ranking executive of the h

Article 4 - son and sister of enron chief secured deals
in addition to the dealings with mark lay, enron for years has used the services of a houston travel agency co-owned by kenneth lay's sister, sharon lay. according to public filings, the agency, alliance worldwide, has booked more than $10 million in revenue from enron, representing over half of the firm's business. mark lay and sharon lay said that nothing improper took place in any of the transactions. all required disclosures on enron's dealings with family members were made, they said, adding that kenneth lay did not use his influence to award enron contracts to companies with family ties. enron declined to comment, and kenneth lay and his lawyer did not return phone calls. no charges were brought against mark lay in the criminal investigation, which came to an end last year after the united states attorney in tyler, tex., decided not to pursue the case. mark lay, who left enron last year to enter a local baptist seminary, paid nearly $315,000 to settle a related civil case, without admitting to any wrongdoing. ''i walked into a snake's nest,'' the younger mr. lay said in an interview this week, describing the business affairs that led to the criminal investigation. ''i trusted the wrong people and ended up in a transaction that everybody decided was wrong.'' legal experts said there were no clear violations of securities laws in the lay-enron dealings. but critics said the transactions were further examples of how top officials of en

Article 5 - market place; some lessons for andersen from scandal at salomon
''the first thing they needed to do was to change the people,'' he said. ''they needed a new general counsel, a new chief executive, a new head of auditing -- people who had no connection with what went wrong.'' that, he recalled, was what mr. buffett did at salomon in 1991. the top four officials of salomon were all shoved aside quickly after the treasury scandal broke, and mr. buffett, an outside director of salomon and an investor in it, became the chairman and chief executive. he brought in a general counsel from outside and eventually turned over the firm to an executive who had been based overseas when the problems arose. before that, mr. breeden recalled, mr. buffett had essentially thrown salomon on the mercy of the government, offering to make whatever reforms the government wanted. ''he told me that if i wanted an s.e.c. enforcement lawyer to sit next to him in his office,'' that would be acceptable, mr. breeden said. mr. buffett, he said, told him that salomon was determined to prove to the government that it had put in honest people and effective controls and would do what was required. if the government wanted to file a felony charge, he said mr. buffett told officials, salomon would plead guilty. there are huge differences in the andersen and salomon cases. at salomon, the top officials had somehow failed to notify treasury officials after they learned of misbehavior

Article 6 - andrew weissmann, mueller’s legal pit bull
“i’m no fan of donald trump,” said dan cogdell, a houston defense lawyer who tangled with mr. weissmann when mr. weissmann helped lead the federal task force investigating enron in the early 2000s. “frankly, i can’t think of two people who deserve each other more than andrew weissmann and donald trump.” if mr. mueller is the stern-eyed public face of the investigation, mr. weissmann, 59, is its pounding heart, a bookish, legal pit bull with two ivy league degrees, a weakness for gin martinis and classical music and a list of past enemies that includes professional killers and white-collar criminals. empowered by mr. mueller, for whom he previously worked as general counsel at the f.b.i., mr. weissmann has taken the lead in the government’s case against paul manafort, mr. trump’s former campaign chairman, whose indictment jolted the capital on monday in a clear signal of the team’s seriousness. mr. weissmann could be seen at an initial hearing in washington with an easy smile, chatting up mr. manafort’s lawyer during a break in the action. friends describe mr. weissmann as relentless and boundary-grazing but fundamentally fair, a creative legal strategist whose hyperdiligence should not be confused with recklessness. he is the prosecutor they would want if their relatives were charged with crimes they did not commit

Article 7 - ideas & trends; mad as hell: hard time for white-collar crime
it is too early to tell whether there is any permanent change in attitudes toward white-collar criminals as a result of the events at enron, worldcom, adelphia and elsewhere. executives have been vilified before, as recently as a decade ago in connection with the savings and loans scandals, but in the past the attention to fraud has waned fairly quickly. yet there are several reasons to think the current revulsion at corporate misdeeds might last. for one thing, stock ownership has spread so far throughout the population that the impact of a corporate collapse -- and of the falling stock market generally -- is felt by many more americans. ''people have come to realize that fraud is a real crime that causes devastating losses,'' said jennifer h. arlen, a professor at the new york university school of law. the harm may not be the same as a physical injury, she said, but loss of retirement funds may ultimately mean that people suffer from medical problems that they cannot afford to treat. in the past, white-collar crime was not penalized as heavily because it was so distant from the lives of ordinary people, professor arlen said. fraud, after all, was perceived to be a rich person's crime, affecting only a remote class of people. thanks to constant coverage in the news media, people have recently had their noses rubbed in both the facts of fraud and in the opulent habits and styles of some wealthy executives implicated in fraud -- the million-dollar homes, private planes, golf

Article 8 - lobbyists still pushing to alter corporate-overhaul bills
with so much momentum to overcome, lobbyists and corporate executives are not holding out much hope of substantially changing much in the accounting and corporate-governance overhaul legislation on capitol hill. but they are trying. the chairman of the intel corporation, andrew s. grove, has been lobbying to modify a major provision of the legislation's criminal-penalties provisions -- prison time for senior executives of publicly traded companies whose financial statements contain material misstatements. mr. grove, who is no longer the intel chief executive, is upset that the requirement would specifically apply to chairmen -- in addition to chief financial officers and chief executives, a congressional aide said. they would have to sign forms attesting to the accuracy of their financial statements, and face up to 10 years in prison for ''knowingly'' violating this provision. most chairmen are also chief executives, and the requirement should not apply to those who are not, mr. grove said, according to the aide. ''he doesn't think he should have to sign the form,'' the aide said. an intel spokesman said mr. grove was worried the provision could disrupt a trend favored by many -- splitting the job of chief executive and chairman. nonexecutive chairmen do not have access to the day-to-day reports needed to have certainty about financial statements, the spokesman said, so the provision would only serve to scare executives away from serving as nonexecutive chairmen. advertisement continue reading the main story negotiators from the house and

houston, where i live, is a place with a famously short memory. the shamrock hotel, where the oil wildcatter glenn mccarthy built the world’s largest swimming pool in the ’40s? demolished in 1987, replaced by a park with some unfortunate phallic fountains. the astrodome? a desolate hulk, even if it was once considered (by houstonians) the eighth wonder of the world. and now, at decade’s end, there is the vanishing enron scandal. skip to next paragraph the decade we had as the 2000s fade to memory, what moments will be remembered as the portents of america's future? op-ed editors asked 10 noted writers consider events large and small that helped shape the last 10 years. more op-eds >> the company’s twin towers were long ago leased to more modest businesses; enron field became minute maid park; and unless you lost a fortune, got sued or indicted or served time  or were related to someone who was or did  the shame of enron’s collapse is long gone. ask most locals about it and you get a hard blink followed by a blank stare: “we’re onto annise now,” someone close to ken lay, the former enron chief executive, told me the other night, talking about our new mayor, annise parker, who’s getting lots of good national press, mostly for being gay. that

Article 10 - supreme court won’t hear complaint by enron investors
washington (ap) — the supreme court dealt a setback on tuesday to enron investors who had sued investment banks to recover money lost when the texas energy giant collapsed amid a huge accounting fraud. the court refused on tuesday to review the investors’ lawsuit, eliminating what might have been the investors’ only hope of keeping the case alive. enron shareholders may seek to revive their case in the lower federal courts, though the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans has ruled against them once before. the demise of enron wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans. advertisement continue reading the main story tuesday’s turndown for the enron investors came without comment in a routine supreme court list of cases that the justices had decided not to hear.

Title: on boards, little cause for anxiety
Content: correction appended do the former directors of the institutions that collapsed during the financial crisis have anything to worry about? if the experience of enron is any example, the answer is a resounding no. a look back at the career paths of onetime enron directors indicates that the former directors of bear stearns and lehman brothers will continue their prominent careers. enron collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 amid accusations of accounting improprieties and outright fraud. the scandal sent shock waves through corporate america, but compared with the global financial crisis, it almost seems small and quaint. still, in the case of enron, unlike in the financial crisis, top corporate executives went to prison. most prominently, jeffrey skilling, a former chief executive of enron, was sentenced to 24 years in prison. yet while some enron executives paid a price for the scandal, it is a different story with enron's former directors - the people charged with overseeing the company. a search of their current whereabouts shows that they have recovered nicely from the scandal. four former enron directors still serve on public boards. frank savage, for example, still heads his own investment firm and serves on the boards of bloomberg l.p. and lockheed martin. norman p. blake jr. serves on the board of owens corning, where he is the head of that company's audit committee. a number have gone back to or entered academia. wendy gramm, the wife of the former senator phil gramm, vice chairman of ubs investment bank, is still in residence at the mercatus center at george mason university. robert k. jaedicke, who was chairman of enron's audit committee, teaches at the stanford university graduate school of business. and lord john wakeham has remained chancellor of brunel university in london. the private sector enron directors also continued their careers without much of a hiccup. ken l. harrison retired as chief executive of the portland general electric company in 2000. and ronnie c. chan has remained chairman of the hang lung group in hong kong since enron's collapse. most of the remaining directors have since retired or now work in small private or family businesses, a euphemism for semiretirement. john mendelsohn, for example, is to retire next month as head of the university of texas md anderson cancer center. then there is rebecca mark-jusbasche. she was named one of the ''luckiest persons in houston'' by fortune magazine. ms. mark-jusbasche left the enron board in 2000, selling more than $80 million worth of company stock. she now runs family properties in new mexico and colorado. a few of the directors conveniently omit enron from their biographies, but they do not appear to remain tainted, staying in their chosen professions. the only court penalty placed upon them was

Corporate Accountability Lacking

The recent wave of corporate scandals has left investors and regulators questioning the integrity of the financial system. The Enron affair, which exposed widespread accounting irregularities, has sparked a renewed focus on corporate accountability.

Despite high-profile resignations and settlements, many executives have escaped significant penalties for their roles in the scandals. For example, Dennis Kozlowski, former CEO of Tyco International, resigned without facing substantial consequences. Microsoft also agreed to alter its accounting practices after being accused of manipulating revenue reports.

The lack of accountability has led to a sense of unease among investors, who are increasingly skeptical of corporate claims. The ongoing trial of Arthur Andersen highlights the need for stronger auditing standards and greater independence from management.

Some argue that the current system is too lenient on executives, allowing them to reap benefits while others suffer losses. A recent settlement with Angelo Mozilo, former CEO of Countrywide Financial, has generated $1.97 billion in penalties, but most of these payments came from companies rather than individuals.

The Enron scandal also led to a re-examination of corporate governance and auditing practices. The case highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability within companies.

As regulators and lawmakers continue to grapple with the implications of these scandals, it is clear that more needs to be done to restore trust in the financial system.

High-Profile Bankers and Executives Face Scrutiny

A recent wave of resignations and departures has shaken the financial industry, with several high-profile bankers and executives facing intense scrutiny. The sudden exits of key figures at major institutions have raised eyebrows, with some speculating that central bank policymakers may be split on issues related to Greece's potential default.

Among those affected is Robert P. Kelly, CEO and Chairman of Bank of New York Mellon, who stepped down due to ""differences in approaches"" to managing the company. The timing of his departure has sparked curiosity, particularly given the growing pressure on the bank over accusations of shortchanging clients in currency trades for foreign transactions.

Meanwhile, a federal judge has revived a securities fraud lawsuit against Bank of America Corp's CEO Brian Moynihan and others, alleging they misled shareholders about the risk of buying back large amounts of soured mortgages. The lawsuit also targets former CEO Kenneth Lewis and other executives.

In another development, Dennis Duban, an accountant for James Pflueger, has been sentenced to 24 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud the IRS and assisting in filing a false federal income tax return. Duban's clients, including prominent auto dealers Charles Alan Pflueger and his father James, were also indicted on similar charges.

These high-profile cases highlight the ongoing scrutiny of financial institutions and executives, with many facing intense pressure to maintain their reputation and avoid scandal. As the industry continues to navigate complex regulatory issues,

The tone is informative and objective, which is consistent with reliable news articles. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""Mysterious Warning Videos Spark Concern"" lacks specific details and facts, instead focusing on speculation and uncertainty, making it less similar to the given article in style and content.","Mysterious Warning Videos Spark Concern

A series of anonymous videos has been circulating online, warning viewers about an impending event. The videos, which have been viewed millions of times, feature a single message: ""We told you something is coming and now it's here.""

The content of the videos varies, but they all convey a sense of urgency and foreboding. Some appear to be cryptic messages, while others seem to hint at a catastrophic event.

Experts are baffled by the origin and meaning behind the videos. While some speculate that they may be pranks or hoaxes, others believe they could be genuine warnings from unknown sources.

The videos have sparked widespread concern, with many viewers taking to social media to share their theories and fears. Some have speculated about the potential causes of the impending event, ranging from natural disasters to economic collapse.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the videos, one thing is clear: they have captured the attention of a wide audience and raised important questions about the role of anonymous warnings in modern society.

As the world waits with bated breath for any further information, experts urge caution and vigilance. The true nature and significance of the warning videos remain unknown, but their impact on public discourse is undeniable.","A Shift in Perspective: Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Human Rights

In recent years, a growing awareness has emerged about the importance of protecting human rights, particularly for marginalized groups. One such group is sex workers, who face significant challenges due to discrimination, violence, and abuse.

Amnesty International has been at the forefront of advocating for their rights, consulting on policies that prioritize their protection. The organization's draft policy draws upon extensive evidence from various sources, including testimony from sex workers themselves.

Meanwhile, a new trend in technology is gaining traction, particularly among younger generations. Dubsmash, an app that allows users to create and share lip-sync videos, has become a sensation. Its features, such as prerecorded audio and self-contained soundtracks, make it easier for users to express themselves without feeling overwhelmed.

However, not all news is positive. A recent outbreak of swine flu on college campuses has highlighted the need for increased awareness about public health. Carnegie Mellon University and St. John's University have taken steps to contain the spread of the disease, while Princeton has reserved spaces for healthy students to minimize contact with infected individuals.

In other areas, a growing focus on environmental sustainability is leading to new investment opportunities. Funds that prioritize low-carbon investments are becoming increasingly popular, offering investors a way to support companies with smaller carbon footprints.

As technology continues to evolve and human rights become more prominent in the public discourse, it's essential to consider the intersection of these two areas. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world for all.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

to get to the base camp, we'd traveled in the back of a covered truck for about an hour, crossing the coto river some 40 miles from quepos, where we were staying. we were a group of five, including my brother-in-law. each of us was given a harness with sturdy leather belts encircling our waists and thighs. reinforced leather gloves completed the outfit. the first part of the tour was a half-hour trek up the side of a mountain. we walked single file, with several guides, into the green gloomy interior. we stopped and looked at prehistoric ferns, a 300-year-old ceiba tree and a small palm tree with elevated roots that one of our guides said literally walks through the forest in search of sunlight. but then i found myself climbing a wooden platform on top of a mountain, gazing down at a steamy jungle floor hundreds of feet below me. a hefty steel cable stretched out across a ravine to another tiny platform several hundred yards away. a costa rican named diego greeted me with an upbeat question.

Article 6 - with dubsmash, lip syncing like the stars
mr. dash says people have probably gravitated to dubsmash because of the app’s combination of audio and video, as well as a host of features that make it less daunting — and thus more enticing — to record a video. for one, dubsmash provides prerecorded audio, which means people don’t have to hear their own voice on a video — a feature that might appeal to those who would otherwise shy away from sharing a selfie video online. and the brief, self-contained soundtracks on dubsmash give each newly recorded video a built-in beginning, middle and end. “putting a camera in somebody’s face and recording a permanent video is really hard to do,” mr. dash said. the app’s various features are aimed at “getting people over the hump to use video, which is a much richer way of communicating.” photo today, the dubsmash platform creates about 35 videos a second — about double the rate of youtube, mr. dash said. but for most users, using dubsmash is not about posting videos for anyone and everyone to see. about 90 percent of the videos are shared privately, mr. dash said. “it’s really people looking for a richer way to express what they actually feel at the moment.” it also flows into the growing number of other visual tools that people can use to express themselves, including gifs, emojis, live streaming video, short recorded video and stickers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please

A Shift in Perspective: Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Human Rights

In recent years, a growing awareness has emerged about the importance of protecting human rights, particularly for marginalized groups. One such group is sex workers, who face significant challenges due to discrimination, violence, and abuse.

Amnesty International has been at the forefront of advocating for their rights, consulting on policies that prioritize their protection. The organization's draft policy draws upon extensive evidence from various sources, including testimony from sex workers themselves.

Meanwhile, a new trend in technology is gaining traction, particularly among younger generations. Dubsmash, an app that allows users to create and share lip-sync videos, has become a sensation. Its features, such as prerecorded audio and self-contained soundtracks, make it easier for users to express themselves without feeling overwhelmed.

However, not all news is positive. A recent outbreak of swine flu on college campuses has highlighted the need for increased awareness about public health. Carnegie Mellon University and St. John's University have taken steps to contain the spread of the disease, while Princeton has reserved spaces for healthy students to minimize contact with infected individuals.

In other areas, a growing focus on environmental sustainability is leading to new investment opportunities. Funds that prioritize low-carbon investments are becoming increasingly popular, offering investors a way to support companies with smaller carbon footprints.

As technology continues to evolve and human rights become more prominent in the public discourse, it's essential to consider the intersection of these two areas. By doing

Mysterious Warning Videos Spark Concern

A series of anonymous videos has been circulating online, warning viewers about an impending event. The videos, which have been viewed millions of times, feature a single message: ""We told you something is coming and now it's here.""

The content of the videos varies, but they all convey a sense of urgency and foreboding. Some appear to be cryptic messages, while others seem to hint at a catastrophic event.

Experts are baffled by the origin and meaning behind the videos. While some speculate that they may be pranks or hoaxes, others believe they could be genuine warnings from unknown sources.

The videos have sparked widespread concern, with many viewers taking to social media to share their theories and fears. Some have speculated about the potential causes of the impending event, ranging from natural disasters to economic collapse.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the videos, one thing is clear: they have captured the attention of a wide audience and raised important questions about the role of anonymous warnings in modern society.

As the world waits with bated breath for any further information, experts urge caution and vigilance. The true nature and significance of the warning videos remain unknown, but their impact on public discourse is undeniable.

824307.0,fake,fake,0.8,122.4328966140747,True,"The article ""Regional Tensions Escalate as Middle East Powers Clash"" contains several red flags that indicate it is a fake news article. Firstly, the article mentions a US lawyer being sentenced to 10 years in prison for aiding a terrorist organization, which is not a real event. Additionally, the article discusses Germany's secret government and its role in shaping European policy, which is also not true. The article's focus on Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in a struggle for influence in the region is plausible, but the tone and language used suggest that it is sensationalized and intended to provoke rather than inform. Overall, the article's content and style are more consistent with fake news articles than reliable news sources.","Regional Tensions Escalate as Middle East Powers Clash

A recent meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca has sparked tensions between Sunni and Shia powers, with Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in a struggle for influence in the region. The OIC voted to suspend Syria, citing violent attacks against rebels, and this decision was seen as a symbolic gesture by King Abdullah towards Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Meanwhile, Qatar's economic influence is being felt globally, with its investments in real estate, petroleum companies, and airlines. This has led some to question the country's intentions and whether it is using its wealth to exert control over other nations.

In another development, a US lawyer has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for aiding a terrorist organization. The case highlights the ongoing struggle between governments and extremist groups, with some arguing that Western powers are often complicit in these efforts.

Economic tensions are also rising, with concerns about the stability of global markets and the potential for a new ""panic mode"" in the US. Germany's secret government is also being scrutinized, with some questioning its role in shaping European policy.

In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has carried out mass executions, including those of prominent Shia clerics, sparking international condemnation. The country's human rights record is already under scrutiny, and these actions have raised concerns about its treatment of minority groups.

As regional tensions escalate, it remains to be seen how these conflicts will play out and what impact they will have on global stability.","Regional Tensions Escalate Amidst Islamist Crackdowns

A growing divide between Gulf states and Qatar has come to a head, with the latter refusing to back down in the face of pressure from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The dispute centers on Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which has led to tensions with its neighbors.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the region, Islamist groups are facing crackdowns. In Morocco, 330 members of an outlawed fundamentalist group were arrested and released after reports of a plot to stage an uprising. The country is grappling with high levels of unemployment, which has fueled unrest.

Tunisia, too, has been affected by violence, with at least 38 people killed in a beach resort hotel attack attributed to the Islamic State. The attack marked one of the worst terrorist incidents in the country's history.

In Egypt, human rights lawyers are facing travel bans and intimidation after speaking out against the government's handling of Islamist groups. The country is still reeling from the aftermath of the Arab Spring, with many Egyptians struggling to find work.

The situation is not unique to these countries, however. Across the Middle East, Christians are facing persecution and ethnic cleansing, with some warning of a ""biblical proportion"" exodus. In Tunisia, protesters are calling for quicker shifts towards democracy and denouncing terrorism.

As regional tensions continue to escalate, it remains to be seen how these crises will unfold and what impact they will have on the wider region.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - gulf states and qatar gloss over differences, but split still hampers them
at the heart of the feud is a dispute over political islam pitting qatar against its neighbors, principally saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. having struck an alliance with the muslim brotherhood in a play for regional influence, qatar financially supported the group’s former government in egypt, opposed the military takeover as an illegal “coup” and provided a haven to islamists in exile after the subsequent crackdown. qatar’s al jazeera network has repeatedly excoriated the new government of president abdel fattah el-sisi. saudi arabia and the u.a.e., which consider the brotherhood a threat to their own stability, both backed the egyptian military takeover. and both have pressed qatar to expel the exiled islamists and curb al jazeera. in the weeks leading up to this month’s regional summit, several gulf news outlets had reported that qatar had effectively buckled, agreeing to both demands. a final communiqué from the meeting expressed “full support for egypt” and mr. sisi’s “road map” for a political transition. but government officials on both sides of the gulf split now acknowledge privately that qatar scarcely budged. instead, saudi arabia and the emirates suspended their anti-brotherhood campaign against qatar because of the more urgent threats they saw gathering around them. a senior qatari official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the joint commun

photo sousse, tunisia — at least one gunman disguised as a vacationer attacked this placid mediterranean resort on friday, killing at least 38 people at a beachfront hotel — most of them british tourists — before he was shot to death by the security forces. the slaughter at the imperial marhaba hotel in sousse, a palm-flecked town on the northeast tunisian coast, was among the worst terrorist attacks in the country’s history and the second in a little more than three months aimed at the tourist industry, which depends on european vacationers. it sent shock waves through the country, which was still recovering from the massacre of mostly foreign tourists at a museum in tunis, the capital, in march. roaming from the beach to the pool to the reception area of the hotel, the assailant appeared to have methodically targeted guests with a kalashnikov rifle he had hidden in a beach umbrella, according to accounts by witnesses, including terrified hotel workers. he was shot and killed by police officers who witnesses said arrived about 30 minutes after the attack began. there were conflicting accounts on whether the gunman acted alone. the interior ministry identified him as a 23-year-old tunisian student with no police record. the islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack, according to statements released friday night on twitter. photo there had been speculation almost immediately that the islamic state might have played a role, partly because it had taken responsibility for the museum attack in

Article 4 - egypt rights lawyer says banned from travel
egypt rights lawyer says banned from travel thu nov 3, 2016 6:59am cairo (reuters) - a prominent egyptian human rights lawyer said on wednesday that airport security officials had prevented him from flying to france and told him he was under a travel ban. malek adly, a lawyer with the egyptian centre for economic and social rights, is part of a team of lawyers suing the government to stop the transfer of two red sea islands to saudi arabia, a decision that has provoked rare protests by egyptians. adly told reuters he had been told he was banned from travel but had not been shown any written order. he believed the ban was because of his opposition to president abdel fattah al-sisi's administration. ""they told me i was banned from travel and gave me no reason. first they said there was an arrest warrant and i explained that it had already been carried out and i was released,"" adly said. ""then they said an investigating magistrate had ordered the ban due to my involvement in a case, but there is no case. whatever it is, it is political."" security sources at cairo airport said adly was banned from travel because he is facing charges of inciting protest against authorities. adly was arrested in may this year and charged with attempting to overthrow the regime. a court ordered him released without any bail in august. egyptian rights activists say they are facing the worst assault

Article 5 - economic frustration simmers again in tunisia
“tunisia today is at a crossroads,” he said. “tunisia today has an opportunity that it must not miss to be a model because the world is watching us, and we mustn’t disappoint.” unemployment remains the biggest economic problem and catalyst for unrest. a vicious circle imperils all the arab nations with unfinished revolutions: political unrest scares off the investors needed to create jobs. since president zine el-abidine ben ali was ousted in january 2011, the unemployment rate has risen to 18 percent of those eligible to work from 13 percent, meaning about 750,000 people are out of work. more troubling, a third of the unemployed are college graduates, said said aidi, minister of the economy for much of 2011. by 2015, an estimated 100,000 new graduates will seek jobs annually, while even before the revolution at most 20,000 graduates a year found work matching their degrees. “ben ali ignored the blinking red lights on the economy, and that is what got him thrown out,” said karim ben smail, the owner of a modest publishing company. “the unemployed are an army in a country the size of tunisia.” the numbers are not all bad, however. the economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2011, troubled by problems like a 30 percent drop in the number of tourists, according to the world bank. it predicts 2.2 percent growth this year

Article 6 - after revolt, egyptians try to shape new politics
scenes like the one here unfold almost nightly up and down egypt. “they did well on facebook, but now they have to take it onto the streets,” said michael meunier, a political organizer and consultant. the tahrir activists inspired millions to pour into the streets in protest, of course. but they are finding that translating a protest movement into votes and a permanent voice in national affairs is a far more grinding task. they have no headquarters — a few camp out in a backpacker hostel in what was once a glamorous apartment house in downtown cairo that has seen its best days. they meet endlessly in smoke-filled rooms, and sweat to find an original name (on friday, a coalition of groups settled on the egyptian social democratic party, which won out over the square, a reference to tahrir). they have little money, although offers are coming in. perhaps most difficult of all, they have to figure out how to present a largely leftist, secular ideology in language that will appeal to a conservative, religious society. “if you want to change the political life, you have to transform it from one about individuals to one about institutions,” nasser abdel hamid, 28, told a rapt audience of about 40 well-to-do men and women in a cairo hair products salon converted to a political salon for the evening. instead of the top-down model prevalent in the arab world, he said, “this is the only chance to have a party that grows

Article 7 - an anti-american boycott is growing in the arab world
purchases of american goods generated by 300 million arabs form such a small part of american exports that even a widespread boycott would not cause much of a blip. most trade consists of big ticket items like airplanes, with total american exports to the middle east amounting to $20 billion in 2000, just 2.5 percent of america's total exports. but a long boycott could retard the spread of franchises and other products, experts say. sales at most american fast-food outlets in the arab world are already off somewhere between 20 and 30 percent on average, american diplomats and industry analysts say, and consumer products face a similar decline. the boycotts have largely been the effort of individuals and small groups without government involvement, like student organizations and such civic organizations as are allowed to exist. they reflect a growing sentiment that arabs should distance themselves from the united states, and they want their governments to do likewise. ''they are beginning to feel that shouting slogans in reaction to what the u.s. is doing is not enough,'' said kamal hamdan, a lebanese economist. a marlboro smoker, he said that whenever he pulls out a packet, somebody invariably now reproaches him with, ''what, still smoking american cigarettes?'' he went on: ''they want to design detailed programs against specific goods and services that might involve the banking system, insurance, financial markets. they want to find some pressure points that can have an economic impact.'' the attitude is

Article 8 - ethnic cleansing could lead to mass exodus of middle east christians
the former president of lebanon, amine gemayel, is a maronite christian. he recently warned of ""an exodus approaching biblical proportions."" gemayel told a gathering in zurich of christian solidarity international (csi) and other human rights activists that the current wave of church burnings, murders, and riots against christians in the mideast is the work of radical islamists. the former lebanese leaders own brother had been assassinated in beirut by these same jihadists. president gemayel's warnings echo those issued two years ago by vienna's catholic prelate. christopher cardinal schönborn in 2012 told a religious freedom roundtable in washington that egypt and syria ""must not become iraq."" he was referring to the ethnic cleansing that had led the post-saddam government of iraq to turn a blind eye to the killing or the driving out of more than half of that war-torn arab country's pre-invasion christian population of 1.6 million. cardinal schönborn listed many famous cities-antioch, smyrna, aleppo, damascus, hippo, alexandria-among the scores of dioceses that had fallen under the sword of mohammed in the seventh and eighth centuries. these historic christian communities were lost or suppressed by muslim conquests. not since those violent days have we seen such tribulation for the regions christians, the cardinal said. that was in 

Article 9 - joy as tunisian president flees offers lesson to arab leaders
beirut, lebanon — hours after president zine el-abidine ben ali fled tunisia on friday, a lebanese broadcaster, in triumphant tones, ended her report on the first instance of an arab leader to be overthrown in popular protests by quoting a famous tunisian poet. “and the people wanted life,” she said, “and the chains were broken.” the day’s seismic events in tunisia, the broadcaster, abeer madi al-halabi, went on, would serve as “a lesson for countries where presidents and kings have rusted on their thrones.” tunisia’s uprising electrified the region. the most enthusiastic suggested it was the arab world’s gdansk, the birthplace of solidarity in poland, which heralded the end to communist rule in eastern europe. that seemed premature, particularly because the contours of the government emerging in tunisia were still unclear — and because tunisia is on the periphery of the arab world, with a relatively affluent and educated population. yet the street protests erupted when arabs seemed more frustrated than ever, whether over rising prices and joblessness or resentment of their leaders’ support for american policies or ambivalence about israeli campaigns in lebanon in 2006 and gaza in 2009. tunisia’s protests were portrayed as a popular uprising, crossing lines of religion and ideology, offering a new model of dissent in a region where islamic activists have long been seen as monopolizing opposition

Article 10 - protesters in morocco seek quicker shift to democracy and denounce terror
abdelilah hassouni, 29, and his father were cooking and selling flaky doughnuts known as “sfinj” and watching the crowd. “the attacks are very bad for morocco, and these children from the february 20 movement are also not helping us now,” mr. hassouni said, turning the sfinj in bubbling oil. “i would advise them to start working and not just shout and demonstrate. do something for the people and the country.” farid chaouki, who works for a fish company here, said that the youth needed to accomplish something before criticizing. “they need to learn to work and bring themselves into society, and then they can go and demonstrate,” he said. “there is no country in this world where people shout for many things to change and get it all at once.” photo no group has taken responsibility for the bombing, which was the worst since a series of explosions in casablanca in 2003 killed 45 people, including 12 suicide bombers. but it bore the hallmarks of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb, officials said, both in its planning and in the bomb’s construction. investigations are continuing, but the bomb, which was stuffed with nails and contained about nine pounds of various explosives, was set off remotely, probably by a cellphone, moroccan officials said friday. a european security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested a relatively new cooperation

Regional Tensions Escalate as Middle East Powers Clash

A recent meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Mecca has sparked tensions between Sunni and Shia powers, with Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in a struggle for influence in the region. The OIC voted to suspend Syria, citing violent attacks against rebels, and this decision was seen as a symbolic gesture by King Abdullah towards Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Meanwhile, Qatar's economic influence is being felt globally, with its investments in real estate, petroleum companies, and airlines. This has led some to question the country's intentions and whether it is using its wealth to exert control over other nations.

In another development, a US lawyer has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for aiding a terrorist organization. The case highlights the ongoing struggle between governments and extremist groups, with some arguing that Western powers are often complicit in these efforts.

Economic tensions are also rising, with concerns about the stability of global markets and the potential for a new ""panic mode"" in the US. Germany's secret government is also being scrutinized, with some questioning its role in shaping European policy.

In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has carried out mass executions, including those of prominent Shia clerics, sparking international condemnation. The country's human rights record is already under scrutiny, and these actions have raised concerns about its treatment of minority groups.

As regional tensions escalate, it remains to be seen how these conflicts will play out and what impact they

Regional Tensions Escalate Amidst Islamist Crackdowns

A growing divide between Gulf states and Qatar has come to a head, with the latter refusing to back down in the face of pressure from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The dispute centers on Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which has led to tensions with its neighbors.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the region, Islamist groups are facing crackdowns. In Morocco, 330 members of an outlawed fundamentalist group were arrested and released after reports of a plot to stage an uprising. The country is grappling with high levels of unemployment, which has fueled unrest.

Tunisia, too, has been affected by violence, with at least 38 people killed in a beach resort hotel attack attributed to the Islamic State. The attack marked one of the worst terrorist incidents in the country's history.

In Egypt, human rights lawyers are facing travel bans and intimidation after speaking out against the government's handling of Islamist groups. The country is still reeling from the aftermath of the Arab Spring, with many Egyptians struggling to find work.

The situation is not unique to these countries, however. Across the Middle East, Christians are facing persecution and ethnic cleansing, with some warning of a ""biblical proportion"" exodus. In Tunisia, protesters are calling for quicker shifts towards democracy and denouncing terrorism.

As regional tensions continue to escalate, it remains to be seen how these crises will unfold and what impact they will have on the wider region.

In a series of remarkable incidents, ordinary citizens have taken it upon themselves to protect their property and communities from crime. From the streets of Alabama to the homes of Texas, individuals have demonstrated bravery and resourcefulness in the face of danger.

In one notable case, a couple in Alabama was able to apprehend three suspects believed responsible for at least two burglaries over the weekend. The suspects were caught off guard when the homeowners, armed with a ""pretty pink gun,"" held them at gunpoint until deputies arrived.

Meanwhile, in New York, officials have been accused of wrongly confiscating guns under the state's strict gun laws. Two citizens had their permits revoked for having a prescription to an anti-anxiety medication, sparking concerns about the constitutionality of the law.

In another incident, a homeowner in Miami shot and killed two robbers who had attempted to break into her home. The homeowner, who was armed with a gun, chased the suspects through her yard before they were apprehended by police.

These incidents highlight the growing trend of citizens taking matters into their own hands when it comes to protecting themselves and their property. While some may view this as a sign of vigilantism, others see it as a necessary response to a system that often fails to protect its citizens.

As one resident noted, ""We're not asking for much. We just want to feel safe in our own homes."" Whether through armed self-defense or simply being aware of their surroundings, these individuals are taking steps to reclaim control over their communities and protect themselves from harm.","Fatal Standoffs and Deadly Confrontations: A Look at Recent Incidents

In recent months, several high-profile incidents have highlighted the complexities of law enforcement and the human right to self-defense. In one case, a 23-year-old woman in Baltimore County was shot and killed by police during a six-hour standoff over alleged assault charges. The incident has raised questions about the use of force by law enforcement and the impact on families.

In another incident, two detectives were shot and killed in Staten Island after being ambushed by suspects who had been tracked through surveillance. The case highlights the risks faced by law enforcement officers and the need for increased security measures.

Meanwhile, a Florida court has ruled that police can use dogs to detect illegal drugs without a warrant, sparking debate about the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The ruling is part of a broader discussion about the balance between public safety and individual rights.

In suburban communities, incidents of violence have highlighted the need for increased security measures. In one case, a 44-year-old woman was shot to death in her condominium complex, leaving investigators baffled by the motive behind the crime.

Homeowners' rights to self-defense have also come under scrutiny, particularly in states with ""castle doctrine"" laws that allow individuals to use deadly force without retreating. The debate has sparked concerns about the potential for abuse and the need for clearer guidelines.

In a bizarre incident, two brothers were arrested after attempting to rob an 11-year-old boy of his iPod. The case highlights the complexities of juvenile crime and the challenges faced by law enforcement in preventing such incidents.

Finally, a violent confrontation during a divorce case led to significant changes in courthouse security measures over two decades ago. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety in public spaces.

These incidents demonstrate the need for ongoing discussions about law enforcement practices, individual rights, and community safety.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

liberty was also attacked in boston (before it's news) this article appeared at: world events and the bible (ron paul) – forced lockdown of a city. militarized police riding tanks in the streets. door-to-door armed searches without warrant. families thrown out of their homes at gunpoint to be searched without probable cause. businesses forced to close. transport shut down. these were not the scenes from a military coup in a far off banana republic, but rather the scenes just over a week ago in boston as the united states got a taste of martial law. the ostensible reason for the military-style takeover of parts of boston was that the accused perpetrator of a horrific crime was on the loose. the boston bombing provided the opportunity for the government to turn what should have been a police investigation into a military-style occupation of an american city. this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself. what has been sadly forgotten in all the celebration of the capture of one suspect and the killing of his older brother is that the police state tactics in boston did absolutely nothing to catch them. while the media crowed that the apprehension of the suspects was a triumph of the new surveillance state – and, predictably, many talking heads and members of congress called for even more government cameras pointed at the rest of us – the fact is none of this caught the suspect. actually, it very nearly gave the suspect a chance to make a getaway. the “

Article 1 - files provide new insights into fatal 6-hour standoff in baltimore county
korryn gaines stared into her cellphone camera. “this is for anybody who wanna know what i’m doing,” she said, panning down to a shotgun perched in her lap. she turned the camera toward her pajama-footed 5-year-old son, who smiled and waved. then back to herself. “i’m m f tired, but the devil at my door, and he’s refusing to leave,” said gaines, 23, with a cartoon blanket wrapped around her shoulders. “i’m at peace. i’m in my home. i ain’t trying to hurt nobody. . . . i am not a criminal.” outside gaines’s randallstown apartment, baltimore county police were in the midst of a tactical operation aimed at coaxing gaines out. minutes later, they would secure a warrant for her arrest on charges of assault and resisting arrest, alleging that she pointed a shotgun at an officer after police kicked in the door to serve preexisting warrants on her and her fiance that morning. eight family members gathered at a church nearby, desperately waiting for answers. the baltimore sun obtained the video through a ­public-records request for the evidence that prosecutors reviewed to determine that the fatal police shooting of gaines and the wounding of her son kodi — at the end of a six-hour standoff on aug. 1 — were legally justified. the evidence includes the contents of gaines’s mobile phones, hours of police radio chatter never before heard by

Article 2 - bad signs for operation, almost from start
in short order, the suspects told the detectives they wanted to do business somewhere else, forcing the detectives off the so-called set of their undercover operation, the terrain where they had arranged surveillance and familiarized themselves with the surroundings. it only got worse. the decision by one of the suspects to get the detectives to stop the car so he could pick up the gun they wanted to buy, a tec-9 pistol, and make a cellphone call required one of four backup police cars trailing the maxima to drive past their colleagues so as not to reveal their surveillance. and then, perhaps most disastrous of all, with the cellphone call completed, the maxima pulled away and lost the other backup cars. seconds later, a small transmitter known as a kel, which allowed the backup team to monitor the exchanges between their colleagues and the gun dealers, failed in the hilly terrain at the north end of staten island. the escalating nightmare was over minutes later. one of the gun dealers, seated behind the detective driving the maxima, fired twice, shooting both men in the back of the head. the detectives, james v. nemorin, 36, and rodney j. andrews, 34, with 15 years in the police department and five children between them, were dumped into the street, leaving the department stunned by its first losses since the sept. 11 terror attack, and a fierce manhunt under way. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're

Article 3 - sniffing dogs and the fourth amendment
a person’s home is a place where the constitution resolutely protects the right to privacy and the freedom from unreasonable government intrusion. that should include protection under the fourth amendment from the police using a dog to smell for drugs outside the door of a house without a warrant. at the supreme court on wednesday, the justices heard arguments in two florida cases involving dogs used to detect illegal drugs. in the first, the police responded to a crime stoppers tip and took a dog named franky to a house before getting a warrant. the dog gave the signal that there was a scent of contraband. afterward, the police got a warrant, searched the home and found marijuana growing inside. in the second, an officer and his drug-detection dog, aldo, were on patrol. the officer stopped a truck after confirming that its license plate had expired. when the officer approached the truck and noticed the driver was shaking and could not sit still, he asked if he could search the truck. the driver said no, so the officer deployed aldo, who did a “free air sniff” and “alerted” the officer to the presence of drugs. the officer found chemicals in the truck for making methamphetamine. in a 2001 case, the supreme court ruled that the police cannot use a heat-seeking device to probe the interior of a home without a search warrant. justice antonin scalia explained that “sense-enhancing technology” got information that “could not otherwise have been obtained without

Article 4 - the sniper next door
these murderers probably look perfectly normal. they may be attractive and above average in intelligence. someone reading this article could very well have met one of these killers and found him polite, helpful, charming or, if nothing else, forgettable. someone reading this article may know one of the killers and refuse to make the connection for the simple reason that we believe only in monsters. we call the sniper a coldblooded monster. we call the baton rouge serial killer a monster. we fear monsters, not ordinary people. we read about monsters in novels and watch them in movies. we are confident that we will be able to peer out the window and recognize a monster immediately. as a perennial student of crime, i am here to tell you that there is no such thing as a monster. neither the sniper nor the baton rouge serial killer is coldblooded. these killers are human beings, as warmblooded as the rest of us. it is unlikely they bear any resemblance to frankenstein's creation. walter sickert, better known as jack the ripper, was strikingly handsome and charming. ted bundy and jeffrey dahmer were good looking and gifted at manipulating others, including the police. intelligent people got crushes on them. equally nonthreatening was david berkowitz, the son of sam killer. he looked like a nobody -- the guy you might stand next to on the subway, the one working around the corner in the deli or sitting on a bench eating a

texas son shoots accused sex offender lurking under mom’s house texas son shoots accused sex offender lurking under mom’s house new york daily news 2:00 pm a texas son shot an accused sex offender in the face after he found the armed suspect creeping under the stairs of his mother’s home, officials said. leonard trevino was rushed to a san antonio hospital for treatment before he was charged with assault for brawling with the family after he lurked outside of their home, according to a police report. but before the thursday attack, the 56-year-old was already a suspect in a child indecency case involving the family, kens reported. leonard trevino was arrested after he was found lurking under a family's home. (bcso) police said the mother and son duo discovered trevino hiding under their home late thursday night. they heard their dog barking outside and when they went to check on the pup, trevino emerged from his hiding spot holding a gun. unregistered sex offender caught asleep at florida mcdonald's the gunman demanded to be let inside the house. when the relatives refused to open the door for him, he said he wanted to kill the son, according to the report. that’s when trevino grabbed a pipe-like object and started beating the son in the head, police said. despite the bashing, the son eventually grabbed trevino’s gun away from him and shot the suspect

Article 6 - shooting death of woman, 44, stuns suburban community
aside from the occasional whoosh of passing traffic, the only noise in this quiet condominium complex this afternoon was the scratch of rakes as investigators searched the ground for clues to a baffling weekend killing. sometime around 1 a.m. on sunday, the authorities said, altagracia aponte, the 44-year-old president of the grandview condominium association, was fatally shot in the parking lot of the two-building complex, a few feet from her minivan and a few dozen steps from her doorway, just after coming home from visiting friends. the police said they answered a 911 call from a neighbor who discovered her body at 1:40 a.m. ms. aponte -- shot in the head, neck and chest -- was pronounced dead 45 minutes later at englewood hospital. today, investigators and neighbors alike said they remained bewildered by the shooting of ms. aponte, a popular woman known as grace among residents of the 24 apartments at the grandview, where she had been president of the condo association for the past several years. advertisement continue reading the main story ''it's certainly a mystery right now,'' said sharyn j. peiffer, an assistant bergen county prosecutor.

Article 7 - unarmed and gunned down by homeowner in his ‘castle’
“given his reasonable belief that he was about to be assaulted, brice’s use of deadly force against dan was justified” under current montana law, ed corrigan, the county attorney, wrote in a four-page letter explaining his decision to the kalispell police. the shooting raises similar questions about armed citizens and their right to self-defense to those raised after the february shooting of trayvon martin, 17, in florida , with the critical difference that mr. martin was shot outside. in montana, it has focused new scrutiny on whether the castle doctrine measure, implemented in 2009, has given homeowners the authority to defend themselves against real threats or has provided a way to kill without consequences. “the community has not been well-served by either the law or the legal process in this case,” the local newspaper, the daily inter-lake, wrote in a recent editorial. photo in 2009, montana joined more than 20 other states in passing broad self-defense measures backed by the national rifle association and other gun-rights groups. under the law, a person can brandish a gun to ward off a threat. an individual does not have to flee or call the police before engaging in self-defense. for criminal trials in which a defendant claims self-defense, the legislation flips the burden of proof, putting the onus on prosecutors to discredit those claims. “it changed things here in montana,” said leo gallagher, president of the montana county attorneys association,

Article 8 - a desperate victim in a trunk? no, a trickster with 2 cellphones
the inspiration for the bogus tale was apparently a real case of abduction and sexual assault that had been all over the news in connecticut on saturday, a day after a new haven graduate student had been kidnapped in west haven, thrown into the trunk of a car and driven to woodbridge, where she had been attacked. while the odds against two such cases in two days within a few miles of one another seemed astronomical, the desperation in the voice of the woman who called the meriden police at 8:45 p.m. on saturday sounded too real, and her account too vivid, to be discounted. cut off repeatedly, calling again and again, the woman blurted her story out in fragments: she had been assaulted in an apartment at 1051 old colony road, then dragged out into woods behind the complex and imprisoned in the trunk of what she thought was a pontiac grand am, possibly a red two-door model. but as investigators fanned out to search for the abductors and examine the crime scenes, there were discordant hints in the unfolding drama. the woman refused at first to identify herself, then reluctantly said her name was santiago. she would not give her age or her birth date. and her phrasing was suspiciously slurred. ''we knew something was strange because she wouldn't cooperate and sounded intoxicated,'' sgt. leonard caponigro recalled. ''the first thing you do if you are really in trouble is tell who you

Article 9 - a boy robbed of his ipod, and, for a time, his nerve
“he had the nerve to shake my hand before we parted ways,” eric said. when the robbers were out of sight, eric ducked into the transit district 12 building and reported the crime. officers put him in a police car and they drove around. eric spotted the boys, but they spotted the police car, too, and the older boy ran away. the police picked up the younger suspect, but as he had played little part in the robbery, officers chose not to charge him, waiting instead to catch the older suspect. it turned out they were brothers, with enough of a history in the precinct that even the commanding officer, deputy inspector kevin nicholson, knew them. photo his memories of interactions with the boys sounded more like mayberry than morris park avenue. “i had arrested them personally for shooting off a bb gun,” he said. he knew where they lived. the boys’ grandmother answered their door one day soon after to face — again — the inspector in his white shirt. “do you remember me?” he asked. she said yes. eric, afraid the boys were part of a gang and fearing retaliation, had said he did not want them arrested. the grandmother, fed up with them, shipped them to relatives upstate, in orange county, inspector nicholson said. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter

Article 10 - when the courtroom can't contain a divorce case
a violent confrontation during a divorce case more than 20 years ago led to some of the most dramatic changes in courthouse security. on may 24, 1984, kenneth spargo shot his wife, priscilla, who was sitting on a bench inside norwich superior court awaiting a hearing in the couple's divorce proceedings. although the courthouse, which had recently opened, had a metal detector, mr. spargo had entered with a handgun through another door. afterward, every courthouse in the state was equipped with metal detectors. in addition, offices for judges and other court personnel were placed behind locked doors and guarded by marshals, judge mack said. ""that was the beginning of the end of the laid-back courthouse,"" judge mack said. despite those upgrades, security is still a major concern for lawyers involved in family court proceedings. shirley m. pripstein, a lawyer with greater hartford legal aid who has practiced family law since 1980, said she often considered exit strategies from the courthouse when she is involved in a difficult divorce case. if she is concerned for her client's safety, she will enter with her client through one door and then have someone pick them up in a car at another exit. when she realized recently that a new courthouse in hartford has only one public entrance, she immediately started worrying, she said. ""one doorway for everyone,"" she said. ""we're sitting ducks."" ms. pripstein has also been confronted in a

Local Residents Take Matters into Their Own Hands

In a series of remarkable incidents, ordinary citizens have taken it upon themselves to protect their property and communities from crime. From the streets of Alabama to the homes of Texas, individuals have demonstrated bravery and resourcefulness in the face of danger.

In one notable case, a couple in Alabama was able to apprehend three suspects believed responsible for at least two burglaries over the weekend. The suspects were caught off guard when the homeowners, armed with a ""pretty pink gun,"" held them at gunpoint until deputies arrived.

Meanwhile, in New York, officials have been accused of wrongly confiscating guns under the state's strict gun laws. Two citizens had their permits revoked for having a prescription to an anti-anxiety medication, sparking concerns about the constitutionality of the law.

In another incident, a homeowner in Miami shot and killed two robbers who had attempted to break into her home. The homeowner, who was armed with a gun, chased the suspects through her yard before they were apprehended by police.

These incidents highlight the growing trend of citizens taking matters into their own hands when it comes to protecting themselves and their property. While some may view this as a sign of vigilantism, others see it as a necessary response to a system that often fails to protect its citizens.

As one resident noted, ""We're not asking for much. We just want to feel safe in our own homes."" Whether through armed self-defense or simply being aware of their surroundings, these

Fatal Standoffs and Deadly Confrontations: A Look at Recent Incidents

In recent months, several high-profile incidents have highlighted the complexities of law enforcement and the human right to self-defense. In one case, a 23-year-old woman in Baltimore County was shot and killed by police during a six-hour standoff over alleged assault charges. The incident has raised questions about the use of force by law enforcement and the impact on families.

In another incident, two detectives were shot and killed in Staten Island after being ambushed by suspects who had been tracked through surveillance. The case highlights the risks faced by law enforcement officers and the need for increased security measures.

Meanwhile, a Florida court has ruled that police can use dogs to detect illegal drugs without a warrant, sparking debate about the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The ruling is part of a broader discussion about the balance between public safety and individual rights.

In suburban communities, incidents of violence have highlighted the need for increased security measures. In one case, a 44-year-old woman was shot to death in her condominium complex, leaving investigators baffled by the motive behind the crime.

Homeowners' rights to self-defense have also come under scrutiny, particularly in states with ""castle doctrine"" laws that allow individuals to use deadly force without retreating. The debate has sparked concerns about the potential for abuse and the need for clearer guidelines.

In a bizarre incident, two brothers were arrested after attempting to rob an 11-year-old boy of his iPod.

As the seasons change, hunters and wildlife enthusiasts alike are gearing up for a thrilling time in the great outdoors. In Utah, forest grouse hunters are enjoying a unique opportunity to hunt in higher elevations during the last month of the season. According to Jason Robinson, Upland Game Coordinator for the Division of Wildlife Resources, reports indicate that the number of ruffed grouse in Utah is slightly above average this fall.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, hunters are preparing for a variety of wildlife encounters. In Alabama, the Black Belt Adventures Association is hosting the Alabama World Championship Bow Hunter Competition, where teams will compete to bag the biggest bucks and doves. In Michigan, deer hunters are taking inventory before archery season begins, making sure their gear is in top condition.

For those who prefer to hunt with a bow, the Super Bowl Championship is just around the corner. The competition promises to be fierce, with prizes awarded based on total team points and individual scores. And for those looking for inspiration, a new short film ""Searching for West"" showcases the beauty of the great outdoors and the dedication of hunters who pursue their passions.

As the seasons unfold, wildlife enthusiasts are reminded that hunting is not just about bagging animals – it's also about respecting the land, its creatures, and the people who share our passion. Whether you're a seasoned hunter or just starting out, there's never been a better time to get outside and enjoy the beauty of nature.","Wildlife Encounters: A Reminder of Human Responsibility

As the seasons change, humans and wildlife continue to intersect in unexpected ways. In a recent incident on a rural property, a hunter's carelessness led to an accident that highlights the importance of safety protocols when engaging with wildlife.

Meanwhile, in the wilderness, animals are adapting to their environments in complex ways. Subsidized species, such as deer and Canada geese, have thrived in human-dominated landscapes, often at the expense of native ecosystems.

In a nearby forest, encounters between humans and wildlife can be intense. A boar, once considered a mythical creature, is now a common sight in suburban areas, forcing residents to reevaluate their relationship with nature.

As we venture into the wild, it's essential to remember that animals are not just creatures of myth and legend. They have complex social structures, behaviors, and habitats that require our respect and understanding.

In some parts of the country, wildlife rehabilitation centers are working tirelessly to care for injured animals, including a bald eagle that was recently released back into the wild after being rehabilitated at a center in Virginia. The success of these efforts underscores the importance of responsible human behavior when interacting with wildlife.

As we navigate our relationship with nature, it's crucial to recognize the intricate web of life that surrounds us. By acknowledging our place within this ecosystem and taking steps to minimize our impact, we can work towards a more harmonious coexistence with the natural world.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

video: searching for west – the most beautiful hunting film you’ll ever see (before it's news) i rarely write about hunting in any way on this blog, mostly because it isn’t something that i personally do. i grew up in the woods with a father and older brother who both still love to hunt, but it was never an activity that struck a chord with me. i simply enjoyed being outside. but i respect hunters greatly and recognize that as a group they often do more for conservation and protection of lands than anyone else. like the rest of us, they share a common bond of a love for the outdoors. a new short film, entitled searching for west, hammers this point home. it follows hunter mark seacat as he goes out into the wild in search of his goals, namely bagging a big bull elk. listening to mark narrate the film i was struck by how much he sounded like some of the other outdoor athletes we follow here on the adventure blog. mountaineers, polar explorers and endurance runners who endure sometimes difficult conditions as they go after their personal trophies. like so many of those men and women, mark questions what he is missing at home while he pursues those goals. this is an incredibly well done and beautiful film that i think you’ll find fascinating to watch even if you’re not a hunter yourself. the scenery is spectacular, the story is compelling and the technical aspects of the film are top notch. it’s about 25 minutes in

goodbye, america – more recollections of deer seasons past (before it's news) by dr. paul kengor grove city, pa - -(ammoland.com)- last week i wrote an article on deer season a half century ago, focusing on my grandmother’s town in the mountains of emporium, pennsylvania. each year, my grandmother and other households opened their doors and kitchens and beds to perfect strangers who came to town to shoot a deer—and there were no problems. the piece was about more than deer season. it was about america, our culture, and how much this country and its people have changed. the article really struck a chord, running in publications from the ammoland shooting sports news to the las vegas review-journal. especially interesting were the responses i got, with numerous readers weighing in with their own recollections. i thought it worthwhile to share a few of my favorites here: from sugarbare: “back in the ‘60s, we left our guns in the cars parked at the high school so that we could immediately head for the woods as soon as school was out. those who drove to school would store guns for those who were dropped off at school…. yep, hunting season was an event.” from buzzard: “when i was in the second grade, i took my dad’s old .38 pistol to school for show-and-tell. now days they would call in the swat team for a kid with an empty shotgun shell.

tom turkey with 10 beards (before it's news) the hunt unfolded just like a turkey hunter would like. rick bay, kooper’s dad, kooper and his brother-in-law, kevin sawyer, hit the woods just before sunrise and set up in a spot where they had heard turkeys. rick said, “we had seven or eight turkeys gobbling and knew there were plenty of turkeys in the area. we were close to some birds, but when they flew off the roost, they went in a different direction where another hunter was calling. we then moved to another spot when we heard some birds right there. we didn’t have time to put the decoys where we wanted when two big gobblers appeared. we got the decoys out and i cleared a spot for kooper to sit. after making a call, the toms came running. after sitting there for about two or three minutes, they came around the corner and when they saw our decoys, they went back into the woods, but after more calling the gobblers started moving towards us. i told kooper to take the second bird because a lot of the time the larger bird is behind the first bird. at about 30 yards out, kooper fired his 20 gauge shotgun and dropped the big bird with a well-placed shot.” sawyer said, “i saw the two birds heading our way and then go back into the woods. i made several soft calls

Article 10 - deer hunters – hit that target in the mirror
deer hunters – hit that target in the mirror (before it's news) deer hunters – hit that target in the mirror glen wunderlich lansing, michigan - -(ammoland.com)- since archery deer season is upon us, it’s incumbent for hunters to take inventory. let’s see… we have sharpened our broadheads, waxed the strings, checked the cables and we’ve been practicing longer and longer shots at targets. certainly the integrity of treestands, that have been in place for years, has been checked, along with pull-up ropes and safety harnesses. in a nutshell, we are feeling pretty good about this season’s preparations. but, there’s another inventory item that must be added to the list: a mirror. no, not for signaling when you become “disoriented” (although a good companion piece in the wild), but one that will return an image of a sportsman. all of us have one of these tools handy, so here are some tips to fine tune that reflection. what is a sportsman, anyway? according to mr. webster, “a person who can take loss or defeat without complaint, victory without gloating, and who treats his opponents with fairness.” relative to hunting, a sportsman, it follows, is a person who can return empty handed and be satisfied. the sportsman, therefore, chooses only shots that he has a very high likelihood of making. adopting one basic principle during practice or in the

Article 1 - cheney's accident holds lessons for all hunters
cheney broke another important safety rule on the armstrong ranch. he failed to make sure that no one was behind his intended target. we have been told that the sun was in his eyes, and that whittington was standing in a gully or perhaps a dried-up pond. neither is an excuse for being careless. some hunting experts have said it is unsafe to shoot a shotgun on the level or downward. actually, it is acceptable to shoot at those angles. when flushed, quail often fly at head height. if you are certain of your companions' whereabouts -- if you know beyond a doubt that they are nowhere near the target -- you can safely shoot at a low bird. things become stickier when a bird flies behind the line. it is natural for hunters to watch the ground ahead of them intently and not pay as much attention to terrain through which they have already passed. the proper procedure for shooting at a bird that flies back is to turn carefully, keeping the muzzle of the gun pointed straight up, and confirm the safety of your shot before lowering the firearm and pulling the trigger. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters

''no sweat,'' said a staff member at the yurt. ''we're all learning out here.'' his words would become the theme of our visit. he helped us into an s.u.v. and set out on a pitted dirt road toward the trailhead. some of the west's great vistas thrust themselves on you with a beauty that is almost oppressive. valles caldera is not one of these places. beyond the windshield, steamship clouds dragged their shadows across valle grande, a treeless, harvest-colored valley that ran to a horizon of ponderosa and green peaks. a bull elk lounged in the valley with his harem, his chandelier of a rack rising above the grama grass. this is not the awe-demanding west of albert bierstadt but the welcoming west of an aaron copland score -- a big-hearted landscape, heroic, promising, completely american. seeing it, you realize that you know valles caldera from billboards and ads and untold westerns. you feel at home. the awe comes in knowing what happened here. two volcanic eruptions, 1.6 million years ago and a little over a million years ago, exploded with blasts that threw 600 times the volume of the 1980 mount st. helens eruption into the air. each time, the spent volcano collapsed on itself, finally leaving a near-perfect ring almost 15 miles in diameter. a lake akin to crater lake in oregon formed inside

Article 3 - in the wild, wild backyard
take deer, for example. they are around every bend, eating plantings in yards, running into cars and, in woodsy areas, wiping out the understory of plant life that is home to birds and other smaller animals. but rather than blaming the animals, dr. klemens uses a new umbrella term to embrace the species that are thriving on humans' turf. subsidized species, he calls them. ''canada geese, deer, purple loosestrife, skunks, opossum, snapping turtles, bullfrogs -- they're all here because we subsidize them,'' he said. no one knows how many deer are in westchester. the new york state department of environmental conservation uses an arcane formula involving hunting statistics to arrive at a statewide guesstimate. that number was 750,000 in 1989. but it has grown to more than 1,100,000 today, of which about 2 percent, or 20,000, call westchester home, according to a department spokeswoman, maureen wren, who added that the deer population in new york has stabilized in recent years, a trend typical of the entire northeast. stabilized? westchester residents might argue. ''we have a large deer population, which is having very severe ecosystem perturbations,'' dr. klemens said. ''the disturbance from deer is more than just the annoyance of running into cars and eating your ornamentals. the deer are altering irreparably the

Article 4 - a hint of danger in the forest
the boar i met up against the fence wasn’t a threat. it was a captive boar, safely behind wire, but all the same, it forced me to consider my own place in the world. because britain had no boars for centuries, nearly everything i know about them is made of older stories. i couldn’t help thinking of this boar as a semilegendary beast charging straight out of the medieval literature i read in my undergraduate years. this was the quarry hunted in ‘‘sir gawain and the green knight’’ and thomas malory’s ‘‘le morte d’arthur,’’ a creature renowned for its formidable ferocity and power. in medieval romances, boars are seen as a challenge to masculinity and hunting them a test of endurance and bravery. what animals mean to us is made of everything we’ve ever heard and seen and read about them, and when we meet them, we expect them to conform to these remembered stories. but there is always a gap of surprise. crows, for example, seem less like murderous vermin after you’ve seen a pair sliding playfully down a snowy roof. living animals resist the meanings we give them. photo humans have a long history of territorial anxieties about wild animals intruding on our spaces. in the 17th century, the english garden writer william lawson advised on the tools you need to keep your property free of marauding beasts, including a ‘‘f

in the first two weeks after the killing, the police dispatched two dozen officers with bloodhounds and dogs trained to find cadavers to search the thick woods, brush and swamps. later, on the theory that an accomplice might have picked mr. palmer up, they traveled to arizona and colorado to check possible hide-outs, according to the palmer brothers. they alerted interpol. no leads. could mr. palmer, a white-bearded, seasoned hunter, outdoorsman and weekend stock-car racer, have survived undetected for a year? wilderness experts think it is conceivable. last winter was not particularly severe, with a low temperature at nearby west point of 6 degrees on jan. 22. les stroud, a wilderness guide and host of the cable television show “survivorman,” said, “an experienced woodsman could survive the rest of their lives in a park if they wanted to.” a person could eat deer’s liver and other raw meat to minimize the need for fires, mr. stroud said, and might also break into cottages for food. photo “in a fantasy world, if i were on the run i’d go to the national parks or cottage country,” mr. stroud said. advertisement continue reading the main story gabe garms, 38, an instructor at alderleaf wilderness college near seattle, a survival school that requires graduates to endure a week in the wilderness with only the clothes on their backs, said

Article 7 - turning the hunt into a trip to the market
“game cannot die for nothing,” said mr. dutournier, who learned to hunt as a child. “you have to invest the time to do something good: to make and to take culinary pleasure from it.” there are rules to learn, he said: “female birds are to be venerated, not killed.” “a wild hare should be shot in the shoulder, not in the stomach, to avoid giving its meat an inelegant odor.” “quality partridge should have the fresh smell of an infant’s diaper.” mr. dutournier lost me on that last one, so he explained more fully. “milky,” he said. i pushed that thought, and the image of the freshly killed animals, out of my mind when lunch was served. happily, i was eased into the meal by a chestnut soup laced with white italian truffle and foie gras. by the time the wild hare arrived a couple of courses later, i was ready. it was served as a rare fillet and as a classic lièvre à la royale (royal hare) with black truffle and foie gras, braised in sauternes and accompanied by beets, potatoes and celery. france has the largest hunting community in europe, with 1.2 million registered hunters, one-third more than in britain and four times as many as in germany. and unlike the traditional english fox hunt (now banned), the practice in france is class blind. at the

Article 8 - wild animals they have known
just let me set things straight from the outset: i am writing about us, denizens of the suburbs, abject worshipers of the s.u.v., because i have no idea what the folk in the big cities worry about this time of the year. is it their minuscule closet space? how deep the slush is on the corner? or how much, or how often, to tip their concierge? i have no idea. i am not even sure how to pronounce ''concierge,'' let alone figure out what his or her functions might be. i live in what they mistakenly call ''the sticks.'' my closet, however -- just like yours -- is larger than their studio efficiency. and with winter arrived, there are more important battles than securing a parking spot in a snowed-in city or worrying about paddling through the streets in your manolo blahniks. we, in the suburbs, have fundamental decisions to make. real battles are brewing at my local vegetable market. battles as old as this world, as ancient as the struggle between good and evil. these totemic roots go back yonder, into the deep past: i'm talking about the clash among the bird people, the squirrel people and the deer people. if you have not taken a side, you do not belong among us. you might just as well move into the city and start worrying about their silly trifles. spare us the details! for we have no time to spare! in the market

Article 9 - predators who fight to control yellowstone
photo the template for animal documentaries these days is well established: go to the ends of the earth to follow cute, photogenic mammals as they organize their days and lives around the primal functions of eating, mating and nurturing their young. the box-office-busting “march of the penguins” focused on emperor penguins in the folds of antarctica; this year’s species, apparently, is the mongoose of the kalahari desert in africa, which inhabits “meerkat manor” on the animal planet cable channel. but as tomorrow night’s episode of the pbs series “nature” reminds us, epic tales can be told closer to home. “in the valley of the wolves” finds its story of kingdom lost and then regained in big sky country, where the cycle of life for a couple of wolf packs plays out amid the spectacular beauty of yellowstone national park. the film was shot by bob landis, a longtime chronicler of yellowstone, over three years in the lamar valley, in the park’s northeast quadrant. and while it follows many of the genre’s conventions, it happily resists the anthropomorphic impulse of recent nature productions to give each animal a specific familiar name. there’s not a flower, rocket dog or mozart to be found, just the tale of what happens when wolf 21, the venerable leader of the druid peak pack, and his mate, alpha female 42, die and leave the pack at risk. advertisement continue

""Wildlife Wonders: A Season of Abundance""

As the seasons change, hunters and wildlife enthusiasts alike are gearing up for a thrilling time in the great outdoors. In Utah, forest grouse hunters are enjoying a unique opportunity to hunt in higher elevations during the last month of the season. According to Jason Robinson, Upland Game Coordinator for the Division of Wildlife Resources, reports indicate that the number of ruffed grouse in Utah is slightly above average this fall.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, hunters are preparing for a variety of wildlife encounters. In Alabama, the Black Belt Adventures Association is hosting the Alabama World Championship Bow Hunter Competition, where teams will compete to bag the biggest bucks and doves. In Michigan, deer hunters are taking inventory before archery season begins, making sure their gear is in top condition.

For those who prefer to hunt with a bow, the Super Bowl Championship is just around the corner. The competition promises to be fierce, with prizes awarded based on total team points and individual scores. And for those looking for inspiration, a new short film ""Searching for West"" showcases the beauty of the great outdoors and the dedication of hunters who pursue their passions.

As the seasons unfold, wildlife enthusiasts are reminded that hunting is not just about bagging animals – it's also about respecting the land, its creatures, and the people who share our passion. Whether you're a seasoned hunter or just starting out, there's never been a better time to get outside

Wildlife Encounters: A Reminder of Human Responsibility

As the seasons change, humans and wildlife continue to intersect in unexpected ways. In a recent incident on a rural property, a hunter's carelessness led to an accident that highlights the importance of safety protocols when engaging with wildlife.

Meanwhile, in the wilderness, animals are adapting to their environments in complex ways. Subsidized species, such as deer and Canada geese, have thrived in human-dominated landscapes, often at the expense of native ecosystems.

In a nearby forest, encounters between humans and wildlife can be intense. A boar, once considered a mythical creature, is now a common sight in suburban areas, forcing residents to reevaluate their relationship with nature.

As we venture into the wild, it's essential to remember that animals are not just creatures of myth and legend. They have complex social structures, behaviors, and habitats that require our respect and understanding.

In some parts of the country, wildlife rehabilitation centers are working tirelessly to care for injured animals, including a bald eagle that was recently released back into the wild after being rehabilitated at a center in Virginia. The success of these efforts underscores the importance of responsible human behavior when interacting with wildlife.

As we navigate our relationship with nature, it's crucial to recognize the intricate web of life that surrounds us. By acknowledging our place within this ecosystem and taking steps to minimize our impact, we can work towards a more harmonious coexistence with the natural world.

The tone and language used in the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE are also more neutral and informative, whereas the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE has a more sensational tone.","Electric Vehicles Gain Momentum

The automotive industry is witnessing a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as governments and consumers increasingly prioritize environmental sustainability. Suzuki, a Japanese automaker, has announced plans to introduce an all-new engine for its minicars, expected to deliver a fuel efficiency of 63.5 mpg when combined with an idle-stop system.

Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc., the pioneer in electric cars, is facing challenges in certain states due to new regulations requiring automakers to sell vehicles through dealerships. The company has taken a strong stance against these rules, opting to end sales in New Jersey instead of adapting its business model.

Other manufacturers are also exploring EV options. Honda unveiled its futuristic-looking EV-ster concept at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, while General Motors is working on the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf models. However, initial sales have been slow, with only a few hundred units sold in the last two weeks.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has criticized the National Automobile Dealers Association's opposition to stricter fuel economy standards, citing concerns about consumer impacts such as increased costs and potential safety risks.

In China, Kandi Technologies is gaining attention for its electric vehicles, which are in high demand despite not being as luxurious as Tesla's offerings. The company's shares have shown significant growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the EV market.

As governments continue to implement regulations and consumers become more environmentally conscious, the electric vehicle industry is poised for significant growth. With manufacturers like Suzuki, Honda, and Kandi Technologies leading the charge, it's clear that the future of transportation is becoming increasingly electrified.","Global Automakers Shift Focus to Emerging Markets

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant shift, with major manufacturers like Nissan and Honda expanding their presence in emerging markets. Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan, has stated that the company intends to take full advantage of growth in these regions, citing rapidly escalating demand in countries such as India, Brazil, Russia, and China.

According to analysts, vehicle sales in developing nations are expected to rise by about 10 million units over the next six years, contributing 76 percent of the industry's entire global growth. Honda, for example, has seen its vehicle sales in developing nations nearly triple in the last seven years, with the company now trying to spread its sources of profits more globally.

Meanwhile, the automotive industry is also seeing a rise in alternative fuel vehicles and electric cars. The growing presence of major carmakers like Tesla and Volkswagen in the plug-in vehicle market this summer is expected to influence purchases by regular consumers.

In addition, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled two concepts for its first pickup, the X-Class, which will target families, outdoor enthusiasts, and commercial customers. The midsize vehicle will be built by Nissan in Spain and Renault in Argentina, and is expected to compete in a global market of 2 billion vehicles.

As the industry continues to evolve, it's clear that emerging markets and alternative fuel vehicles are becoming increasingly important. With major manufacturers shifting their focus to these areas, it's likely that we'll see significant changes in the automotive landscape over the coming years.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(before it's news) the jeep compass was launched way back in ’07 as a slightly manlier alternative to car-in-drag metrosexual fwd/awd compact crossovers like the honda cr-v and toyota rav4. it offered a notch up in the way of off-pavement capability – largely due to the two speed transfer case, low-range-gearing mimicry performed by a cleverly programmed cvt automatic transmission, more-than-most ground clearance (8.2 inches) and the availability of “trail rated” rugged stuff such as underbody skid plates, tow hooks and m/s-rated all-terrain tires. this, it was hoped, would be sufficient to draw in buyers who were interested in more than just another crossover. well, not so much. traditional light-duty crossover buyers didn’t embrace jeep’s new medium-duty crossover – probably at least in part because the specially programmed cvt made a racket (relative to conventional hydraulic automatics) and also because (so equipped) the compass seemed to always point toward the nearest gas station. what to do? fiat – chrysler’s new owner – reportedly has a replacement for the current model in the hopper. but it won’t be here before 2015 – the model year, if not necessarily the calendar year. in the meanwhile, a few stop gap updates to the existing compass – the chief one being a new six-speed conventional (hydraulic) automatic transmission that’s been added to the roster. it makes the

environmentally friendly cars (before it's news) many of us fondly remember fred flinstone and his foot-powered automobile. unfortunately, the self-powered car never materialized in our real world. instead, we have millions of cars on the road today that all use a lot of gas and produce fumes that are harmful to our environment. environmentally friendly cars are a big step in the right direction. while many still require the use of gasoline the consumption is severely reduced, and to many people that care deeply for the environment that is wonderful news. one of the most popular types of environmentally friendly cars is the hybrid. the hybrid car uses gasoline in order to function, but it does not use gasoline to the same degree that regular cars and trucks do. instead, hybrid cars use gasoline in addition to a battery and motor to power the automobile. the battery helps to make a smaller amount of gas last longer. this means that hybrids often have a much higher mile per gallon (mpg) rating than regular cars. a lot of the top car suppliers have begun selling hybrid cars in order to help people consume less gasoline, especially as gas prices continue to grow. one of the most popular hybrids available is the toyota prius. this model offers a convenient hatchback design and its success and reliability has helped to place hybrids as a viable automobile option even to many of the most severe critics. honda also sells a popular hybrid option, that being their civic hybrid. as hybrids develop further many companies are starting

Article 7 - electric cars: leaf and volt sales starting off slow
electric cars: leaf and volt sales starting off slow % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) {etrelated 47898, 45452, left}electric cars recently unveiled by chevy and nissan are not posting electrifying sales, media reports said on friday. in december, general motors sold between 250 to 350 chevy volt models, according to cbc. and nissan has sold only 10 leaf models in the last two weeks. the leaf costs around $$32,000 as a base price and the volt costs around $$40,000. according to the associated press, gm has predicted that they will sell 10,000 volts in 2011. in 2012, the company expects to sell between 35,000 and 45,000 models. for people looking to purchase the volt or leaf in the near future, they probably will not be able to until 2012, when the cars are rolled out nationwide. ap reported that 50,000 people have already signed up on the waiting list to buy the electric cars. the volt can travel around 40 miles solely on its battery power before it needs another recharge. it comes with a small gas engine that gets up to around 375 miles in tandem with its electric motor. read more at the epoch times source:

Article 8 - auto dealers rebut “concerned” scientists
auto dealers rebut “concerned” scientists (before it's news) the union of concerned scientists (ucs) and seven other green groups sent the national automobile dealers association (nada) a letter (dated october 19) criticizing nada’s opposition to president obama’s plan to increase new-car fuel economy standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by model year (my) 2025. the ucs letter parrots the administration’s claims about the many wonderful benefits more stringent fuel economy standards will achieve during mys 2017-2025. in a letter dated november 2, nada points out that the claimed benefits depend on assumptions, such as future gasoline prices and, most importantly, whether consumers will want to buy the cars auto makers are forced to produce. the ucs letter neglects to mention that, according to the administration’s own estimates, the my 2025 standard would add at least $$3,100 to the average cost of a new vehicle. nada also notes other likely consumer impacts: vehicles that currently cost $$15,000 and less effectively regulated out of existence. weight reductions of 15%-25%, with potential adverse effects on vehicle safety in collisions. 25% to 66% of the fleet required to be hybrid or electric, even though hybrids today account for only 2-3% of new vehicle sales. the “concerned” scientists also completely ignore nada’s critique of the legal basis of obama’s fuel economy agenda. ep

Article 1 - nissan and others add factories in emerging markets
speaking at an annual shareholders meeting on wednesday in yokohama, nissan’s chief executive, carlos ghosn, said that surging prices for raw materials would force car companies to raise prices — but that the economic malaise afflicting the united states and japan would make it harder to increase sales in the face of higher prices. so places with rapidly escalating demand — like india, brazil, russia and china — will be more important than ever. “we intend to take full advantage of growth in emerging markets,” mr. ghosn said. “these developing markets used to be an afterthought” for japanese automakers, said hirofumi yokoi, an analyst in tokyo for csm worldwide, the auto market research company. “now they are the industry’s future.” according to csm, vehicle sales in developing regions are expected to rise by about 10 million units over the next six years, contributing 76 percent of the industry’s entire global growth. in the last seven years, nissan’s vehicle sales in all developing nations have nearly tripled to 1 million units, out of the company’s 3.7 million vehicle sales last year. “it used to be that honda relied on its u.s. business, maybe too heavily,” said honda’s president in india, masahiro takedagawa. “nowadays, we are trying to spread the sources of profits more globally, beyond just one market.” photo to be

Article 2 - autos on monday/design; next up, crossover convertible coupes
even the simplest division -- is it a car or a truck? -- can be tricky to pin down. appearances alone are not a reliable indicator; some small wagons, like the subaru outback, fall into the truck class. because trucks fall under less stringent economy and safety standards, the designers deliberately set out to meet parameters, like ride height and interior layouts, that the government has set for trucks. body styles have often been used as part of the name of a model, like the civic hatchback. but hatchback, an honest description of the car's practical function, is a name no longer spoken in polite company. no automaker wants to admit its products are mere transportation. coupes are elevated to sport coupes and sedans become sport sedans -- the marketing department's way of saying the car is not as dull as it sounds. new subtypes emerge regularly. what may once been called an s.u.v. -- before that label acquired a certain stigma -- may now be a ""multiactivity vehicle."" the chevrolet ssr has the visual cues of a pickup but also a retracting hardtop, making a case for inclusion among the ranks of convertibles. sedans redesigned with graceful rooflines assume a new identity as four-door coupes, something of an oxymoron as the term coupe has largely been associated with two-door body styles. the name flies in the face of reality, but has been used by saturn in the past and will probably become more popular when

Article 4 - taking the future for a drive; california family tests honda's fuel cell car
so grandiose is the experiment that honda has made arrangements with a distributor of hydrogen to have a refueling station built near the spallinos' house. not that they can use it. the local fire department, wary of this elemental zeppelin gas, has yet to let the station open. so the car is being refueled at honda's american headquarters in torrance. putting compressed hydrogen in a car sounds more like putting air in a tire than filling up with gas. honda is also working on upgrading an existing station that is near mr. spallino's office, and california is financing refueling stations to form what is called a ""hydrogen highway"" in the state. honda has been a pioneer in bringing advanced technologies, like hybrid electric cars, to consumers. while every major automaker has built a fuel cell prototype, honda's is the only one that has been crash-tested. why did honda pick the spallinos? mr. spallino was already one of a few thousand owners of a civic that runs on natural gas; filling one up is not unlike refueling the fcx. he also lived near the company's headquarters, and its refueling station. and the normality of the spallino family appealed to the company, which wanted to see how the vehicle held up under the stresses of family driving. ""i use it for everyday life,"" said sandy spallino, 40, who also drives a ford taurus station wagon. ""i go

Article 5 - here, the sticker is just a start
i scanned the paper at the car dealership. the single sheet listed the usual items you'd find on a window sticker, except the price. ''so, um, how much does this car cost exactly?'' i asked. ''as is, with these options, probably somewhere around $50,000'' she said. such is the grueling world of car buying, singapore-style. this tiny island nation of four million people keeps a grip on how many cars are on its roads. that makes buying a car here difficult, confusing and expensive. after taxes and fees, owners will end up paying more than double a car's original market value. my trip through this labyrinth began while i was on vacation here. a sucker for strange foreign cars, i was smitten by a honda airwave i saw in a showroom. the airwave is built on the same platform as the honda fit hatchback sold in the united states. but while the fit costs around $14,000, the airwave in singapore costs as much as a mercedes-benz e-class. i asked singapore's land transport authority, the agency that controls automobile regulations, for an explanation. the authority sent me a chart that could be used to find the cost of any car by calculating its average original market value price and adding the following: additional registration fee: 110 percent of original market value; customs tax: 20 percent of original market value; goods and services tax: 7 percent of original market value; registration fee

Article 6 - this summer, electric cars are merging into california’s traffic
“the people who buy this car are the movers and shakers — leaders in arts, entertainment, business,” said paul scott, a co-founder of the advocacy group plug in america who now sells electric leafs at a nissan dealership in downtown los angeles. “i sold a leaf to danny devito,” mr. scott said. “he’s that kind of guy. but you’ve got a lot of people who just will not put themselves into a small car.” on the other hand, he said, celebrities who live large are the ones who “will drive the market” if they embrace upscale electric cars like the tesla, influencing purchases by regular janes and joes. following the model s’s introduction last weekend, tesla is providing thousands of test drives for reservation holders, starting in fremont and los angeles before moving on to a dozen cities across north america. california drivers are also getting a chance to get behind the wheel of the $38,145 electric sedan from coda, based in los angeles, at test-drive events through the summer in southern california and the san francisco bay area. the car will initially be sold through four dealerships in the state. what’s markedly different about the plug-in vehicle market this summer is the growing presence of some of the world’s largest carmakers. ford began slowly delivering its $40,000 focus electric to dealers in may (a month in which just six units were sold) and was expecting to ship

Article 7 - mercedes x-class pickup to go on sale in 2017 - marketwatch
daimler’s dai, +1.96% mercedes-benz brand recently unveiled two concepts for its first pickup, the x-class, that will go on sale next year. the midsize vehicle will target families, outdoor enthusiasts and commercial customers. mercedes said europe, latin america, south africa, and australia will be key markets for the pickup. the brand also said it is examining whether to sell the vehicle in the u.s. market. “we are keeping a close eye on the u.s. market,” volker mornhinweg, head of mercedes vans, said in an emailed statement. no decision has been made. “we are evaluating the conditions for such a move,” he said. the x-class will share underpinnings with the nissan nsany, -4.94% np300/navara and renault alaskan. it will be built by nissan in spain starting next year and by renault in argentina in 2018. the pickup is the latest product in an industrial alliance between daimler and renault-nissan. the x-class will fill one of the last remaining gaps in mercedes’ product range, ceo dieter zetsche said. the auto maker believes midsize pickups are becoming increasingly attractive for private use in additional to their reputation as commercial workhorses. double cabs that seat up to five have emerged as the dominant body style. the x-class will compete in a global market of 2

Article 8 - bonkers three-wheeled ev wants to outpace the polaris slingshot
a startup company from quebec named girfalco is preparing to introduce an electric three-wheeler developed with an unabashed focus on performance. dubbed azkarra, girfalco’s first model takes the form of a three-wheeler similar in concept to the head-turning polaris slingshot . the final design is still under wraps, but a dark teaser image published by the canadian firm suggest the azkarra features a wedge-shaped open-top body with a low front end, pronounced front fenders, and an integrated roll bar. unlike the slingshot, the azkarra will exclusively be offered with a battery-electric drivetrain. in its most basic configuration it’s equipped with a single electric motor that zaps the lone rear wheel. buyers who want more power and more grip will be asked to step up to the s model, which adds torque vectoring and a three-motor all-wheel drive system. girfalco boldly promises the azkarra s will be the quickest model in its category, and capable of keeping up with more expensive four-wheeled cars. more: could startup riversimple be the tesla of hydrogen cars? the azkarra isn’t a stripped-down, track-only machine that’s uncomfortable to drive out on the open road. the list of standard features includes a pair of bucket seats, a stereo system with kenwood speakers, two usb ports, aux inputs, and bluetooth connectivity. additionally, nearly every aspect of the roadster can be

(the dallas morning news) ■ volkswagen announced over the weekend that it would recall 1.1 million vehicles worldwide for a problem with the rear suspension that could lead to crashes. the recall covers 2011-13 jettas and 2012-13 beetles, including about 442,000 vehicles in the united states and 126,000 in canada. volkswagen said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. (reuters) ■ chevrolet said this week that the 2016 camaro would be smaller than the current model and built on the same platform as the cadillac ats. the automaker said that the new camaro might even be offered with a turbocharged 4-cylinder engine option like its competitor, the ford mustang.

Article 10 - not coming soon to a lot near you: chinese cars
still, despite china’s manufacturing prowess, it is, for now, proving a lot harder than automakers here anticipated to make cars that appeal to western tastes. while chinese cars are inexpensive and approaching western levels of reliability, chinese automakers have not yet brought their styling, safety, emissions and performance standards up to snuff, let alone their skill at marketing home-grown nameplates around the globe. in one glaring example last year, a german automobile club tested one of 700 vehicles shipped to europe by a tiny chinese manufacturer of sport utilities. it came up with a result that humiliated the chinese officials who oversee the mostly state-owned chinese car industry: the vehicle, the landwind new vision, got the worst crash rating the club had ever awarded in 20 years of testing. “most of the chinese companies that were preparing for exports have turned cautious, because this is a very difficult job,” said lawrence ang, a board member who oversees international finance at the geely group, a large, publicly traded chinese automaker. chinese subcompact cars from manufacturers like geely and lifan have surprisingly ample headroom, but fall short of western tastes in other areas. the exteriors of chinese cars tend to have simple curves and straight lines that are easy for factories to stamp out of steel, but look starkly utilitarian by western standards. even names like geely (pronounced jee-lee) are unfamiliar. china’s automakers also face rising wages at the same time the country

Electric Vehicles Gain Momentum

The automotive industry is witnessing a significant shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as governments and consumers increasingly prioritize environmental sustainability. Suzuki, a Japanese automaker, has announced plans to introduce an all-new engine for its minicars, expected to deliver a fuel efficiency of 63.5 mpg when combined with an idle-stop system.

Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc., the pioneer in electric cars, is facing challenges in certain states due to new regulations requiring automakers to sell vehicles through dealerships. The company has taken a strong stance against these rules, opting to end sales in New Jersey instead of adapting its business model.

Other manufacturers are also exploring EV options. Honda unveiled its futuristic-looking EV-ster concept at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show, while General Motors is working on the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf models. However, initial sales have been slow, with only a few hundred units sold in the last two weeks.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has criticized the National Automobile Dealers Association's opposition to stricter fuel economy standards, citing concerns about consumer impacts such as increased costs and potential safety risks.

In China, Kandi Technologies is gaining attention for its electric vehicles, which are in high demand despite not being as luxurious as Tesla's offerings. The company's shares have shown significant growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the EV market.

As governments continue to implement regulations and consumers become more environmentally conscious, the electric vehicle industry is

Global Automakers Shift Focus to Emerging Markets

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant shift, with major manufacturers like Nissan and Honda expanding their presence in emerging markets. Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan, has stated that the company intends to take full advantage of growth in these regions, citing rapidly escalating demand in countries such as India, Brazil, Russia, and China.

According to analysts, vehicle sales in developing nations are expected to rise by about 10 million units over the next six years, contributing 76 percent of the industry's entire global growth. Honda, for example, has seen its vehicle sales in developing nations nearly triple in the last seven years, with the company now trying to spread its sources of profits more globally.

Meanwhile, the automotive industry is also seeing a rise in alternative fuel vehicles and electric cars. The growing presence of major carmakers like Tesla and Volkswagen in the plug-in vehicle market this summer is expected to influence purchases by regular consumers.

In addition, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled two concepts for its first pickup, the X-Class, which will target families, outdoor enthusiasts, and commercial customers. The midsize vehicle will be built by Nissan in Spain and Renault in Argentina, and is expected to compete in a global market of 2 billion vehicles.

As the industry continues to evolve, it's clear that emerging markets and alternative fuel vehicles are becoming increasingly important. With major manufacturers shifting their focus to these areas, it's likely that we'll see significant changes in the automotive landscape over the

A recent sting operation in Ukraine has resulted in the capture of three North Korean spies, who were attempting to obtain missile technology secrets. The operation was carried out by Ukrainian authorities, with assistance from intelligence agencies.

Meanwhile, a Russian ""double agent"" has been named by a Moscow newspaper as having worked for American interests. The agent, identified as Colonel Shcherbakov, had a senior role in Russia's foreign intelligence agency and was accused of helping to break up a Russian spy ring last summer.

In the United States, a new facial recognition technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University is being explored for use in law enforcement. The system uses drones equipped with cameras to identify individuals, including those who may be security risks.

However, not all efforts to combat espionage and hacking are successful. In New Zealand, it has been revealed that the country's equivalent of the NSA, the GCSB, illegally spied on Kim Dotcom, a prominent internet activist. Despite acknowledging the breach, authorities have decided not to prosecute the agency.

In other news, Russia has launched an investigation into Google's business practices, accusing the company of violating anti-trust laws. The move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Russian government to regulate the tech industry.

(before it's news) say cheese pittsburgh (kdka) – much like fingerprints, our faces are unique – no two exactly alike. as human beings, we see the differences, but what can a computer see? in the movie “minority report,” cameras in a shopping mall recognize tom cruise’s character and ads speak directly to him. while that’s fiction, new technology at carnegie mellon university is not. inside the cylab biometrics center at cmu, is a drone that’s programmed to seek out faces. it wants to take your picture. and in the next room, is something they’re working on for the department of defense. the camera the drone uses can see someone’s eye from a distance and then the system checks to see if that person has been entered into its database – or is a possible security risk. but the center’s director mario savvides showed us something remarkable. they started by taking a picture of kdka’s david highfield and adding it to their computer. “first step, we analyze the face to extract 79 landmarks,” said savvides. it mapped out his face and then determined that he’s male and caucasian. it’s similar to the fictional mapping seen on many tv shows, where detectives compare faces. but at cmu, from a single picture of highfield looking straight forward,

Article 4 - how the government has treated a past journalist it connects with espionage
(before it's news) as edward snowden is indicted (see scott shackford’s report below), it’s worth revisiting an interesting and detailed account from the nation earlier this week about currently imprisoned journalist barrett brown. to simplify a pretty complicated story, brown dumped the contents of an anonymous-released dump of documents grabbed from stratfor, a private intelligence/security company into a public wiki dedicated to investigative journalism he ran called projectpm, and began looking into a mysterious company called “endgame systems,” an info-security firm with multi-million dollar yearly subscriptions services supposedly involving giving away info on how to exploit systems vulnerabilities in computers. then things got ugly for barrett brown. excerpts: the fbi acquired a warrant for brown’s laptop, gaining the authority to seize any information related to hbgary, endgame systems, anonymous, and, most ominously, “email, email contacts, ‘chat’, instant messaging logs, photographs, and correspondence.” in other words, the fbi wanted his sources. when the fbi went to serve brown he was at his mother’s house. agents returned with a warrant to search his mother’s house, retrieving his laptop. to turn up the heat on brown, the fbi initiated charges against his mother for obstruction of justice for concealing his laptop computer in her house. (facing criminal charges, on march 22, 2013, his mother, karen mccutchin, pled guilty to one count of obstructing the execution of

Article 5 - politifact demonstrates why it is incapable of separating fact from fiction
politifact demonstrates why it is incapable of separating fact from fiction (before it's news) somehow the lesson learned by the media and democrats this election year was that russian hacking and fake news changed less than 100,000 votes in three states and delivered the election to donald trump. both stories are pernicious in the extreme. ironically, among the first documents released from the pilfered dnc emails was donald trump’s oppo file and the fact that none of the released emails were doctored indicates that embarrassment rather than electoral manipulation. any damage done to clinton and the democrats was merely the result of their duplicity being revealed… something a non-supine press would have already done. this story is clearly being flogged with the singular intention of hurting trump and it is being done at the direction of the white house. it, however, is background noise. it will go away. what is more damaging is the myth of “fake news” swaying voters. ever since we woke up on november 9 the legacy media has been baying for the role of curator of what news is real and what is fake on the internet. the pathetic leftwing novelty site, snopes.com, has demanded a role. as has the loathsome politifact run by the tampa bay times and funded by a platoon of major progressive foundations… many of whom were also major donors to the clinton foundation, a factoid politifact never discloses when fact checking

isis fake passport network broken up in russia % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) debkafile was founded by a team of journalists in june 2000 as an independent internet web site, providing an intelligence and security news service. february 18, 2016, 1:59 pm (idt) russia’s fsb intelligence service announced thursday that it had arrested 14 people suspected of belonging to an international network that produced fake passports and other documents for isis terrorists traveling between syria and russia. a special investigation unit of the interior ministry and the intelligence service arrested the suspects after a wide-ranging operation that collected enough evidence to put them on trial. the suspects were found to be in possession of large anmounts of printing plates, stamps and advanced means for producting fake documents. the suspects operated secretly by switching identities, addresses and cellular telephones as well as frequently using encryption programs. our unique angle on these subjects – and strong intelligence dimension – has earned debkafile a global reputation and a steady readership – which skyrockets in times of crisis. source: http://www.debka.com/newsupdate/15098/isis-fake-passport-network-broken-up-in-russia

Article 7 - russia opens google anti-trust investigation
russia opens google anti-trust investigation % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) russian regulators have officially opened an investigation into google’s business practices after the country’s largest search engine firm accused the tech titan of violating anti-trust laws. the federal antimonopoly service (fas) of russia announced friday it would move forward with the case against google after determining a complaint filed by yandex had merit. “we have studied the complaint and decided to open proceedings regarding the violation of anti-monopoly regulation,” a fas spokeswoman told reuters. she declined to comment further on the probe. yandex sent a complaint to the fas earlier this week, accusing google of breaching russian anti-trust law with the bundling of its search app and other services with the android operating system. yandex is also accusing google of forcing mobile device makers to pre-install its apps and to set google search as the default, even though android is billed as an open platform. manufacturers also are not permitted to install services from google’s rivals, yandex charged. google has denied any wrong-doing, telling reuters the way it does business does not violate anti-trust law. “device makers are free to install the apps they choose and consumers always have complete control over the apps on their devices,” google said in an e-mail to the media agency. the european union launched an informal investigation in 2013 into how google uses its android operating system to “

Article 8 - the internet post
police admit that nz spy agency illegally spied on kim dotcom, but aren’t going to do anything about it you may recall that it came out last year that the new zealand equivalent of the nsa, the gcsb, illegally spied on kim dotcom (oh, and dozens of others), possibly with the help of the nsa, despite not being allowed to spy on those in new zealand.an investigation by the police has agreed that the gcsb clearly broke the law… but the police have said that they don’t plan to prosecute the spy agency . because, you know, that might hold them accountable. now, at least, the gcsb knows that it can abuse the law at will with no punishment. instead, it appears that the excuse being used by the police is the same one we’ve been hearing from nsa defenders: because these abuses weren’t intentional, they can be ignored: today, detective superintendent peter read told a media conference that in spite of the gcsb committing one breach under the provisions of the crimes act, no criminal “intent” by the gcsb could be established. i’m not sure that actually makes sense. yes, when it comes to criminal activity, intent can be important in determining if it’s actually criminal, but there’s little doubt that the gcsb intentionally spied on dotcom. it wouldn’t have taken very much at all to recognize that dotcom was a resident of new zealand who

Article 9 - nsa – ‘top secret’ arsenal released in protest of ‘trump betrayal’
nsa – ‘top secret’ arsenal released in protest of ‘trump betrayal’ headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! 21st century wire says… out of all the intelligence agencies in the united states, we’ve come across stories where not everyone is on the ‘same page’. indeed we’ve also heard about factions embroiled in competition, and rivalry. moral compass, personal principles, and ethics being challenged which lead to inner conflict; just some of the reasons that gave us former nsa whistleblower william binney and more recently in the last few years, edward snowden. you might not have heard of them, but ‘the shadow brokers’ came on the scene last year. a previously unknown collective, the brokers hacked and released legitimate hacking tools from the nsa’s own special-ops entity, the “equation group”. the initial speculation, the russians, of course. everything is russia by proxy these days. the shadow brokers released a certain amount of the ‘equation group’ hacking tools asking for one million bitcoins, roughly $568 million at the time. the shadow brokers are back and since their initial hack it is assumed that this could be the work of a disgruntled ‘in house’ employee. furthermore they’re not happy at all with president donald j. trump for numerous reasons, including his recent decision to launch 59 tomahawk missiles into syria. more on this report from zerohedge…

Article 10 - russia offers 3.9 million ruble bounty for help identifying ‘users of tor’
russia offers 3.9 million ruble bounty for help identifying ‘users of tor’ headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! russia’s interior ministry has offered 3.9 million rubles (about $111,000) to anyone who can develop software capable of identifying users of tor, the anonymous internet browsing platform, the guardian reports. tor conceals its users from probing observers by hiding the origin and destination of information traveling across the internet. surveillance and security expert andrei soldatov told the guardian that russian authorities may be seeking ways to eliminate that kind of capability, and that the public announcement of the offer was a “signal” to the online russian community that it is being watched. in march the government blocked three major news sites that published work that opposed president vladimir putin and in may required that all sites that had more than 3,000 daily visitors join a registry. the government also recently adopted a law requiring all internet companies to store russian user data within the country. britain passed a similar measure earlier this month. this “emergency surveillance legislation” bolsters the british government’s ability to require that phone and internet companies retain data and hand it over to the country’s security services. according to web entrepreneur anton nosik, the 3.9 million ruble bounty will likely do nothing to bring the russian government closer to identifying tor users. “the only significance [of the tender] is the money being paid and

a revealing kim kardashian photo shoot is out, but it doesn't mean she's back elizabeth yuko pin it share kim kardashian — or more specifically, her butt — appears to be making a comeback in a salacious set of new photos also featuring her sister, khloé. but don't start pouring the champagne yet — the pictures are not coming directly from mrs. kardashian-west herself. while kim and khloé appear in a spread from the winter issue of 032c released on thanksgiving, this does not necessarily signal a return to the spotlight for kim. typically, there are several months between a print publication's photo shoot and when the issue actually comes out. so yes, kim might be pictured with her sister bare-bottomed and rolling around on the beach, but she didn't release these images herself. kim and khloé are in two photos featuring apparel by yeezy — the fashion label belonging to kim's husband, kanye west. the first image has kim sprawled out on the sand with khloé sitting next to her, resting her hand on her famous derrière. both sisters are wearing ankle boots, thong bodysuits, and tattered sweaters in neutral colours — an interesting choice for the beach. in another picture, the kardashian sisters are wearing the same high-cut flesh-toned bodysuits, only this time, they're in the shower without any undergarments. like what you see

boston (ap) — it didn't take a divisive presidential election to get mark chester interested in immigrants. chester has been celebrating immigrants for years, making it his mission to photograph two people from every nation. chester is well on his way. since 2011, he's photographed people from 185 of the world's 196 countries, all of them immigrants who have settled in massachusetts, a state he affectionately calls ""a mini united nations."" all his subjects have become naturalized u.s. citizens. chester's collection of more than 350 photographs have been exhibited around massachusetts — most recently at the statehouse — and he is now putting them into a book he plans to distribute free to schools and libraries around the state. he said his project, called ""the bay state: a multicultural landscape — photographs of new americans,"" has taken on new meaning since republican president-elect donald trump said during his campaign he would build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico and temporarily ban muslims from entering the u.s.

(in this stranger-than-fiction election, can we really rule anything out?) when provocative photos of her emerged in the new york post , she was slut-shamed. that happened again when a (now-retracted) report in the daily mail suggested that melania had also been a high-end escort.

Global Intelligence Landscape Shifts as Spies and Hackers Operate in the Shadows

A recent sting operation in Ukraine has resulted in the capture of three North Korean spies, who were attempting to obtain missile technology secrets. The operation was carried out by Ukrainian authorities, with assistance from intelligence agencies.

Meanwhile, a Russian ""double agent"" has been named by a Moscow newspaper as having worked for American interests. The agent, identified as Colonel Shcherbakov, had a senior role in Russia's foreign intelligence agency and was accused of helping to break up a Russian spy ring last summer.

In the United States, a new facial recognition technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University is being explored for use in law enforcement. The system uses drones equipped with cameras to identify individuals, including those who may be security risks.

However, not all efforts to combat espionage and hacking are successful. In New Zealand, it has been revealed that the country's equivalent of the NSA, the GCSB, illegally spied on Kim Dotcom, a prominent internet activist. Despite acknowledging the breach, authorities have decided not to prosecute the agency.

In other news, Russia has launched an investigation into Google's business practices, accusing the company of violating anti-trust laws. The move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Russian government to regulate the tech industry.

As tensions between nations continue to rise, it is clear that espionage and hacking will remain major concerns for governments around the world.

The cloud computing market is experiencing rapid growth, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.6% expected from 2014 to 2019. This trend is driven by the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions among small and large businesses alike.

As companies look for ways to stay competitive, they are turning to cloud computing as a means to access powerful software applications and streamline their operations. Cloud computing enables businesses to build ""borderless offices"" where teams can collaborate remotely, eliminating unnecessary travel costs and reducing the environmental impact of business operations.

Several major players are investing heavily in cloud computing, including IBM, which has acquired analytics software provider Varicent Software, and Microsoft, which is partnering with Toyota to create a next-generation telematics platform. These partnerships demonstrate the growing importance of cloud computing in driving innovation and growth in various industries.

Meanwhile, companies like Onshape are developing new 3D modeling platforms that promise to revolutionize product development. With its focus on cloud-based solutions, Onshape aims to make it easier for businesses to access powerful tools and collaborate with teams remotely.

As the demand for cloud computing continues to grow, companies are looking for ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors. By investing in cloud-based solutions and partnering with other industry leaders, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and drive growth in a rapidly changing market.

With its focus on innovation and customer satisfaction, Onshape is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud computing. As companies continue to adopt cloud-based solutions, it's clear that this trend is just beginning – and those who adapt quickly will be at the forefront of the revolution.","Tech Giants Shift Focus to Cloud Computing and Virtual Reality

The tech industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with major players shifting their focus towards cloud computing and virtual reality. According to experts, the era of consumer electronics as hardware is giving way to software and cloud-based services.

Google's Hardware Director, Matt Hershenson, notes that ""we're entering this era where consumer electronics is the hardware, and the software and the cloud."" This shift is evident in the growing popularity of cloud-based applications for mobile devices, with over five million businesses using Google's cloud-based tools.

Virtual reality (VR) technology is also gaining traction, with companies like Lucasfilm and Microsoft exploring its potential. A new VR experience featuring Darth Vader is reportedly in development, while Google has announced plans to integrate WebVR support into its Chrome browser.

The rise of cloud computing and virtual reality is also being driven by the need for more immersive experiences. Companies like Snapchat are incorporating augmented reality (AR) features into their apps, allowing users to overlay digital effects onto real-world environments.

Meanwhile, entrepreneurs and investors are taking notice of the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies. Michael Moë, a leading authority on innovation and investment, notes that ""it's a wildly exciting time just to be living, to be an entrepreneur, to be an investor.""

why onshape is developing a new cad system (and five reasons this is just the beginning) (before it's news) it’s been a forest of quiet chirps, gentle rains and hidden high fives in cambridge, ma, headquarters of onshape. the company launched quietly in 2012 as belmont technology inc. and started turning heads with an all-star roster of cad industry elite. now with a shapely new name and a team of nearly 100, you can expect they’re working on something big. from the crew they have amassed, licensing the parasolid kernel, and website copy that reveals they are indeed “applying cloud, web and mobile technologies to cad”, it’s evident a new 3d modeling platform is set to emerge. and, with a pre-production version already in the hands of design teams, set to emerge soon. we’re certain it could change the landscape of product development and everyone we’ve talk with is anxious to learn more. last week that happened. onshape published their first blog post, their first tweet and their first facebook post. why break the silence? well, we suspect it’s leading up to the highly anticipated product launch, but also to ask one question. “why?” jon hirschtick, founder and chairman at onshape, provides the answer. what does he say after 50 years of cad development history and 30 years of personal experience in the industry? “today is still the beginning. today, we

Article 3 - google dash set to try and simplify complex web evironments
google dash set to try and simplify complex web evironments (before it's news) it’s no secret that google must rely on javascript to help power its own series of services in the form of webapps. however, the recent news that they are working on an alternative form of language to help speed up and provide more consistency to applications comes as no surprise. what is surprising is that this concept was being held for some time as a bit of a secret. javascript in its current form today encompasses over 20 different frameworks. as google discovered long ago in developing its own digital infrastructure, it’s simply to the benefit to the company over the long term to just go ahead and create tools and interfaces that can support enormous amounts of data and ever-complex behind the scenes processing power. the art of how google does this so beautifully is that they make it look really simple to the end user. take bigtable for example. the concept behind this internal technology that helps to power both homogenous google services as well as google app marketplace products is that it’s underlying structure is built to be able to handle hugely vast stores of information. although some developers have taken to gripe about having to play by google’s rules when using frameworks such as big table, it comes to the overall benefit of everything that speed and simplicity is the ultimate goal for google’s technology. again, the user is not supposed to see all of these elements of complexity. so back to google dash, formerly known as dart. developers who take

atlas cloud at “tip of the iceberg” as cloud computing catches on (before it's news) it is tempting to say that all an investor needs to know about atlas cloud (cse:ake) is that the young data centre expects to be profitable a few months from now, grow slowly but surely, and see earnings inch higher with each new contract signed. but that would be to overlook the larger, more interesting picture that revolves around the company’s decidedly refreshing business philosophy. it is equally important to understand that atlas cloud plans to prosper in vancouver’s fast-moving technology scene by going back to basics. founder and ceo fred stearman is a veteran of large communications companies such as bell canada and telus. if you accessed a website to buy tickets to the vancouver winter olympic winter games in 2010 or checked results of your favourite events, then you have seen stearman’s handiwork. designing and maintaining the internet backbone for the olympics is just one of the highlights of a 30-year career in programming, hosting and other activities, serving mostly large clients in western canada. good as his employers and other big companies were at taking care of larger clients, stearman could never shake the feeling that other customers were often at a disadvantage simply because they were small fish in a big pond. atlas cloud’s mission is to upend that dynamic and put the small business first. what exactly is a data centre, you ask? the “cloud

Article 4 - kinect as the next-generation mouse
redmond, wash. -- behind kinect, the computer game device that recognizes gestures and voice commands, lies a far larger agenda for microsoft. the kinect technology, according to craig mundie, microsoft's chief research and strategy officer, is the beginning of a new way of communicating with computers. for the past quarter of a century, computing has mainly meant typing on a keyboard and using a computer mouse to point and click on graphic icons on the screen -- the graphical user interface, or gui (''gooey''). kinect, a $150 add-on to the xbox game console, points the way to a different model, a natural user interface, or nui, said mr. mundie. increasingly, he insists, the computers that surround us will understand our speech and hand gestures. the machines, in essence, will become a bit more human. kinect, mr. mundie said, was ''the first incarnation of the next big thing in computing.'' that was the main theme of a daylong series of talks and presentations on monday by microsoft researchers and executives here at the company's headquarters. for the last few years, mr. mundie has hosted these annual gatherings for a small group of journalists, to offer a glimpse of some of the work-in-progress in microsoft's research labs. the company sold more than 8 million kinect devices in its first 60 days on the market, starting in november. that success validated the work done on the project by seven different

Article 6 - controlling your desktop from an iphone, at a distance
if you're a heavy iphone user who also owns a pc, you've probably experienced the annoyance of having to get up from a comfy couch or an office meeting to go back from your phone to your computer for something. for 99 cents, splashtop's new iphone app, remote desktop, lets you fire up your computer's display on the iphone. you can control apps, click and type at them, even play audio and video from your computer over the iphone. remote desktop runs on newer iphones-the 3gs and 4 versions-as well as on the third and fourth-generation ipod touch. splashtop builds the instant-boot systems that ship with many pcs - lenovo quick start, asus expressgate, hp quickweb - so it's no surprise that remote desktop is small, fast and reliable. and cheap. the company says its goal is to become a widely used go-anywhere platform, rather than to make money selling apps, so they've knocked the price down from an original $7 for the ipad to just $1 for the new iphone app. to connect your iphone to a computer, both need to be on the same wi-fi network. that can be at home, at an office, or in a hotel room. install the splashtop app on your iphone and another small, free download on your computer. it'll work on windows xp, vista and windows 7 computers, and there's a beta version for mac os x

Title: gdaas gives frame some cad virtualization competition
Content: gdaas gives frame some cad virtualization competition (before it's news) cloudalize is a company you’ve probably never heard, but you’ve certainly heard of desktop virtualization. you know, accessing all your apps (cad, cae, bim, etc.) from the cloud via any browser or mobile device? yes? well, up until now frame has been the headlinershowing the possibilities, with quick creation of a virtual workspace, and solidworks, siemens and others using them as a cloud solution. it’s a wide open space and cloudalize is ready to give frame some competition. the belgian-based it startup has developed their own online workspace solution called gpu desktop as a service, or gdaas. with most cad, cam, cae programs built for utilizing all the cpu/gpu power available, desktop workstations have been the only solution, but with more people going mobile (and the lack of cad mobile apps) leaves virtualization via a browser a viable option, not only for cad users, but for software developers who would just as soon not develop mobile or browser-based apps. gdaas is client-configurable, browser-based platform pre-configured with an 8-core cpu, 32gb of ram, 2gb gpu and a 200gb ssd virtual workstation. they have many applications already pre-installed including autocad, luciadlightspeed, solidworks, revit, arcgis pro, inventor, and many others. of course, it’s scaleable from there. this is how they illustrated it, over a year ago: as shown in the video, their cloud-based platform is built on nvidia’s grid technology, which is sort of a hybrid solution that provides virtual gpu (vgpu) power, powered by nvidia’s k1 or k2 video cards, so that commands from virtual machines are transferred directly to the server-based gpu without the need for translation protocols and therefore don’t sacrifice server performance. cloudalize offers virtualization via html5 compliant browsers as well as through citrix receiver. traditional subscription package for those that rely on an annual service and a pay-as-you-go option for those needing a single project solution. users can even rent gdaas for a few hours if the need arises. a free trial is available here. read gdaas gives frame some cad virtualization competition at solidsmack. read more about cad, product design and related technology at solidsmack.com source: http://www.solidsmack.com/cad/gdaas-gives-frame-some-cad-virtualization-competition/

The style and content of the reliable news article are more similar to the given article, as both discuss a contentious issue in a neutral and informative manner. In contrast, the fake news article ""Hidden Land Deals and Unseen Consequences"" takes a broader approach, discussing various land deals and their potential consequences, but it does not specifically address the beach privatization issue.  The reliable news article is more focused on the specific topic of beach privatization in San Antonio, whereas the fake news article appears to be a general commentary on property development. The tone and language used in the reliable news article are also more objective and less sensational than those found in the fake news article.","""Hidden Land Deals and Unseen Consequences: A Look at the Unregulated World of Property Development""

A recent surge in high-stakes land deals has left many wondering about the true cost of progress. In one instance, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist is seeking $30 million from the state of California to restore public access to a beloved beach, sparking outrage over the sale of public lands.

Meanwhile, in Florida, the Mormon Church has purchased hundreds of thousands of acres across three counties for over half a billion dollars, raising concerns about the impact on local communities. The church's plans for ""master-planned communities"" have been met with skepticism, as experts warn that such developments can lead to gentrification and displacement.

In other parts of the country, residents are facing unexpected changes in their neighborhoods. A couple in rural England discovered that a 700-home estate was being built around their farm cottage without their consultation, highlighting the need for greater transparency in planning processes.

The issue is not limited to individual cases; a broader trend is emerging as governments and corporations seek to prioritize profit over people's needs. In Nova Scotia, Canada, a provincial housing strategy has been criticized for failing to address the needs of low-income households, who are often forced to pay exorbitant rents or face homelessness.

As the world grapples with issues of gentrification, displacement, and environmental degradation, it is clear that the unregulated world of property development poses significant challenges. As one expert noted, ""when property rights are weak, people tend to take care of their property... but when they're not, we see graffiti, litter, broken windows, and often, rats.""","San Antonio Beach Privatization Debate Heats Up

A contentious issue has been brewing in San Antonio, with many questioning whether shorefront homeowners should be required to open their land to the public. The debate centers around beach privatization, a topic that sparks intense discussion among residents and visitors alike.

Article 4 - provincial housing strategy could do more for people on low incomes
(before it's news) nova scotia needs more affordable housing. roughly 43,000 households (12 per cent of all households in nova scotia) are in housing crisis mode, meaning that shelter is either inadequate, unsuitable or unaffordable. the recently released provincial housing strategy describes how supporting home ownership and creating mixed communities through alliances with private developers and non-profit organizations will address this shortage of affordable housing. pamela harrison, although supportive of the strategy in general, fears that the document does not sufficiently address the needs of people who receive social assistance or struggle to make ends meet on very low incomes. harrison is the provincial coordinator for the transition house association of nova scotia. she is also one of the main authors of those sections in the canadian centre for policy alternatives alternative budget that deal with housing issues. “all of us have different capabilities, different ways that we contribute to communities, but all of us have the right to be respected. if people have limited ability to contribute that doesn’t mean that they should be sacrificed in terms of housing and safety,” says harrison. there is a general consensus that anybody who spends more than 30 percent of their income on housing is spending more than they can afford. yet, harrison argues, for people on social assistance, average market rents can easily consume as much as 80 percent of their income. even subsidized “affordable” apartments often remain out of reach for them. what this shows, harrison argues,

the air force is preparing to steal the land of millions of americans dave hodges december 10, 2013 the common sense show the title of the article is not hyperbole. the air force is indeed preparing to steal as many homes as needed to fulfill two objectives: (1) to ensure the profitability of the military industrial complex (2) to use the mission of the air force to drive down home values, in the adjacent areas to a planned canamex highway and to force as many people as possible off of their land in the process in furtherance of the north american union (spp). we estimate that anywhere from 15 million americans to 20 million americans will be impacted by the air force’s shenanigans and will suffer greatly reduced property values or be forced off of their land entirely without compensation. how is the air force going to do it? is your property safe if you don’t live in the immediate area adjacent to an air force base? how has the air force become the prostitute of the globalists? these questions, and many more will be answered in this article. the air force has indeed become the prostitute of the globalists all across this country, in more than a dozen cases and growing, the air force is busy forcing people off of their land in order to preserve the profits of lockheed martin and other military industrial complex organizations. the newer breed of air force aircraft (e.g. f-22, f-35) is far

Article 9 - fresh off his campaign to make socialism great again, bernie sanders buys third home worth…
after losing to hillary clinton, bernie sanders is back to his day job as a us senator for vermont. sanders campaigned against the 1%, promising to bring america closer to his democratic socialist ideal and to take corporations and rich people down a peg or two. but now that his campaign is over, he’s picking up a sweet new pad. according to seven days, a news publication in vermont, the democratic socialist from vermont shelled out 600 grand for a lake house. the burlington resident last week plopped down nearly $$600,000 on a camp in north hero. sanders’ new waterfront crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of lake champlain beachfront on the east side of the island — facing vermont, not new york. the bern will keep his home in burlington and use the new camp seasonally. “we’ve traveled up to the islands many times over the years — almost always on day trips,” sanders’ wife, jane o’meara sanders, told seven days in a written statement. “we’ve been impressed with the north hero community, eaten at the north hero house and shore acres and have suggested them to friends who were looking for a beautiful place to stay or have dinner. st. anne’s shrine in isle la motte is my favorite church and it is nearby.” some quotes from twitter include: “millionaires! bernie sanders buys “camp” on vt island

Article 10 - new york airbnb law hurting b&bs
new york airbnb law hurting b&bs (before it's news) matthew feeney the campaign against airbnb in new york city has claimed some surprising collateral damage – actual b&bs. according to mary white of bnb finder, half of all the b&bs in the city have closed down since legislation in 2011 aimed at limiting airbnb abuses came into effect. the statewide law prohibits building owners renting rooms in residential buildings and apartments for less than 30 days. the law may have been aimed at preventing apartment buildings from being turned into illegal hotels, but it has resulted in fines being issued to b&b owners. the owner of one of new york city’s b&bs launched an advocacy group in 2011 that lobbies for changes in legislation but does not list its members. given the legislation affecting b&bs it is understandable that bnb owners would be hesitant to increase their exposure. a crain’s new york business article on the decline of b&bs in new york city quotes the owner of a brooklyn inn, who limits the amount of attention her business receives online in order to avoid city investigators: most people don’t even know b&bs exist in the city. now many innkeepers are keeping a lower profile, hoping not to attract the city’s attention. the owner of a european-style inn in brooklyn, who did not want to be identified, said she limits her online exposure by not listing her property with travel sites like expedia

Firstly, the language used is sensationalistic and alarmist, with phrases such as ""uncertain future"", ""widespread anxiety"", and ""catastrophic changes"". This type of language is often associated with fake news articles.  Additionally, the article lacks concrete evidence or credible sources to support its claims. The warning about cosmic energy increasing is not attributed to any scientific organization or reputable source, which raises suspicions about its validity. Furthermore, the article's focus on speculation and hypothetical scenarios, such as the arrival of Pluto and the potential impact on Ireland's economy and social fabric, suggests that it may be more focused on generating clicks and attention than providing factual information.  In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides a balanced and fact-based report on various astronomical events and scientific discoveries, without sensationalizing or speculating about their implications. The article cites credible sources and provides concrete evidence to support its claims, which increases confidence in its authenticity.","Ireland Prepares for Uncertain Future as Cosmic Energy Increases

Cork, Ireland - A public forum on the country's future is set to take place on January 28, amidst growing concerns about the impact of increasing cosmic energy on the nation. The event comes as a warning from an unknown entity suggests that a powerful celestial force is approaching, holding an ultra-high capacity charge.

The warning has sparked widespread anxiety, with many citizens expressing fears about the potential consequences of this energy surge. As the planet Mercury and other celestial bodies align in the heavens, some are speculating about the arrival of Pluto, a ""horrible star"" that may bring catastrophic changes to Ireland's economy and social fabric.

Meanwhile, protests have erupted across the country, with demonstrators calling for a coordinated dismantling of the European Union. The unrest has been fueled by concerns about the impact of economic policies on ordinary citizens.

In response to these growing tensions, government officials have issued statements assuring the public that they are working to address the underlying issues driving the unrest. However, many remain skeptical, and the situation continues to unfold with increasing uncertainty.

As the world waits with bated breath for the arrival of this celestial force, one thing is clear: Ireland's future hangs in the balance, and the consequences of this event will be felt far and wide.","Cosmic Alignments and Celestial Events

A rare cosmic alignment has occurred, with the orbits of Mars, Earth, and the Sun falling into a straight line. This opposition has sparked interest in astronomical events, particularly total lunar eclipses known as ""blood moons."" According to biblical prophecy, these events may signal significant changes.

Meanwhile, scientists have been studying the universe's mysteries, including dark matter and its effects on galaxies. Recent experiments have recorded excess cosmic ray emissions, which some believe could be evidence of a certain type of dark matter particle collision. However, further research is needed to confirm this theory.

In the outer solar system, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has been exploring the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies left over from the earliest days of the solar system. The spacecraft will soon visit a smaller ice ball, 2014 Mu69, providing a close-up look at another piece of the frigid debris beyond Neptune.

Astronomers have also been tracking asteroids and their potential impact on Earth. A recent warning about objects striking our planet has highlighted the need for precise radar tracking and early warning systems.

In other news, a study has revealed that fast electrons are speeding above Earth's surface at nearly the speed of light. This phenomenon is puzzling, as it doesn't fit current models of space radiation.

As we continue to explore the universe, scientists are pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

Article 2 - new images refine view of infant universe
cosmologists still do not know what dark matter — the material that provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies — is, but the planck results have increased their knowledge of what it is not, according to the french center for national scientific research. recently space experiments like nasa’s fermi gamma-ray space telescope and alpha magnetic spectrometer have recorded excess cosmic ray emissions that, some say, could be evidence of a certain kind of dark matter particles colliding and annihilating one another. after planck, we need another answer for those experiments, the french agency concluded in a statement. neal weiner, a particle theorist at new york university, who is not part of planck, concurred. that model of dark matter, he said in an email, if not completely excluded, now could be severely constrained. “if this holds up, at the very least a possibility to discover dark matter is now diminished.” planck dealt a blow to another possible dark matter candidate, namely a brand of the ghostly particles known as neutrinos. physicists have known of three types of neutrinos for some time and have wondered if there were any more, whose accumulated mass would affect the evolution of the universe. planck’s results leave little room for a fourth kind, so-called sterile neutrinos. compounding the frustration of cosmologists in the room in ferrara and at large was an issue that has galvanized them for the better part of a year: whether astronomers had detected the very beginnings of

Article 3 - nasa’s new horizons spacecraft has next mission after pluto
photo the next destination for nasa’s pluto probe is to be a much smaller ice ball in the outer solar system, the space agency announced on friday. the new horizons spacecraft, which captured a cornucopia of photographs and data during its pluto flyby last month, is to make a similar examination of a small, icy body known as 2014 mu69 in 2019 if nasa approves an extension to the mission. while the vistas of this object would not be as breathtaking and varied as those of pluto, the visit would provide a close-up look at another piece of the frigid debris beyond neptune, part of what is known as the kuiper belt. the debris, left over from the earliest days of the solar system, gives insight into how planets formed. pluto is about three billion miles from the sun; 2014 mu69 is almost a billion miles beyond pluto. nasa has already examined smaller icy objects like comets, some of which originate in the kuiper belt, and pluto, the largest kuiper belt object. the flyby of 2014 mu69 would fill in the picture for an intermediate-size kuiper belt object. “we want to connect the dots,” said s. alan stern, new horizons’s principal investigator. advertisement continue reading the main story dr. stern had always hoped to follow up the pluto visit with another kuiper belt object. a concerted search using the hubble space telescope turned up

Article 4 - is everything about to change? the first of four blood moons occurs april 15
astronomical events have been making headlines lately. on april 8, the orbits of mars, earth, and the sun fell into a straight line in a rare cosmic alignment called an opposition. precisely one week later, we will see the first of four extremely unusual total lunar eclipses. is there any significance to these extraordinary celestial events? could it be that god is using the sun, moon, and stars to communicate with us and to announce things to come? the answer is yes! the bible is clear that the sun, moon, and stars are connected to israel and biblical prophecy. throughout history god has used the science of astronomy (never astrology!) in connection with historical events to write prophetic messages in the heavens. one significant way god reveals coming events is through a phenomenon that scientists call ""blood moons."" these are total lunar eclipses in which the moon appears to be blood red. the coming message from god is so urgent that he is going to sovereignly arrange the sun and the moon to perfectly align themselves to create not just one blood moon, but a tetrad-a series of four consecutive blood moons! nasa has projected that the next tetrad will begin on april 15, 2014 and end on september 28, 2015. it will occur in the following sequence: 1. passover-april 15, 2014 2. feast of tabernacles-october 8, 2014 3. passover-april

Article 5 - nasa discovers mysterious electron superhighway above earth
some electrons are speeding above earth's surface at nearly the speed of light, and nasa isn't sure why. according to a new study, the tiny, charged particles were found accelerating to high speeds in an unexpected part of space, farther from earth than previously realized. the region these fast electrons were found in, known as the foreshock, is the part of the solar system where charged particles streaming from the sun are thought to be reflected back from earth's magnetic field toward the star. see also: nasa is firing lasers on mars — here’s why until now, however, scientists didn't think the region could speed up particles to the degree that was observed “this is a puzzling case because we’re seeing energetic electrons where we don’t think they should be, and no model fits them,” david sibeck, a co-author of the new study published in the journal physical review letters said in a statement . “there is a gap in our knowledge, something basic is missing,” sibeck said. the study evaluated data from a nasa program known as themis — a mission involving five identical space probes tasked with studying earth’s auroras and the radiation environment around our planet. human space travel implications charged particles streaming from the sun out into the rest of the solar system can harm satellites in orbit and even people living in space. that radiation needs to be understood in order to guard against its worst effects. “this affects pretty much every field that deals with high-energy particles,

helmut k. wimmer, whose vivid depictions of twirling planets, glowing comets, pulsing nebulas and space-bending black holes awed thousands of visitors craning their necks under the dome of the old hayden planetarium for more than 30 years, died on march 20, 2006, near his home in stuart, fla. he was 80. officials at the planetarium and its parent institution, the american museum of natural history, said they had not been told of mr. wimmer’s death until last week. news of his death was published only as paid death notices in papers in florida. mr. wimmer was the planetarium’s staff artist from 1954 to 1987, primarily during its predigital days and before the 90-foot-high glass cube of the rose center for earth and space, with its new planetarium, opened in 2000. working in a basement studio with an airbrush, and sometimes adding pebbles for three-dimensional effects, mr. wimmer produced hundreds of paintings on cardboard sheets. his finely etched paintings were then transferred onto high-resolution slides. inserted into as many as 200 projectors on the perimeter of the planetarium’s 48-foot-high dome, or into the tentacled, insectlike zeiss projector standing in the middle, mr. wimmer’s images wove seamless panoramas of cosmic vistas. advertisement continue reading the main story for a martian landscape

Article 8 - not such a stretch to reach for the stars
from his doctoral thesis, dr. breeden remembered that in a chaotic gravitational dance, stars are sometimes ejected at high speeds. the same effect, he believes, could propel starships. first, find an asteroid in an elliptical orbit that passes close to the sun. second, put a starship in orbit around the asteroid. if the asteroid could be captured into a new orbit that clings close to the sun, the starship would be flung on an interstellar trajectory, perhaps up to a tenth of the speed of light. “the chaotic dynamics of those two allow all the energy of one to be transferred to the other,” said dr. breeden, who came toting copies of a paper describing the technique. “it’s a unique type of gravity assist.” darpa, by design, pursues out-of-the-box projects without immediate military use. (in the 1960s and 1970s, for instance, the agency laid the groundwork for the internet.) david l. neyland, the director of tactical technology at darpa, who orchestrated the one-year starship study, noted that his agency was founded more than 50 years ago as a response to sputnik, the soviet union’s cold war satellite coup. and the research and development of technologies that could lead to a starship, he said, would likely create useful military spinoffs. “at every step along the way in the space business, the department of defense has benefited,”

Article 9 - tracking asteroids
to the editor: russell l. schweickart's warning about objects striking the earth was a thoughtful call to action (''the sky is falling. really,'' op-ed, march 16). as he noted, the first step is discovering, tracking and characterizing the near-earth environment, and the next step is to establish capability for very early warning of any real danger. sadly, the only facility on earth capable of precise radar tracking of near-earth objects may lose its financing. the arecibo radio telescope in puerto rico, the world's largest, may be closed by the national science foundation in a misguided attempt by a few scientists to clear the decks for financing new projects. it is ridiculous to shut the telescope down when it can be operated for just a few million dollars per year, far less than all the space missions being discussed. this is one case in which the politicians may be smarter than the scientists. congress should act to keep arecibo open. louis friedman executive director the planetary society pasadena, calif., march 16, 2007

Article 10 - light show that fizzled
like eager paparazzi, astronomers trained an arsenal of telescopes this spring on the milky way’s crowded center, hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch an immense gas cloud collide with the galaxy’s supermassive black hole. the shock generated when the cloud smashed into gas surrounding the black hole, 26,000 light-years from earth, could have produced radio waves, x-rays and a possible brightening of infrared light. but researchers saw nothing. new observations of the cloud, known as g2 — along with a neighboring gas cloud, g1, that passed close to the black hole 13 years ago — have led astronomers to an intriguing explanation for the light show that wasn’t. stefan gillessen of the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching, germany, and his colleagues found that g1 and g2 have identical orbits that lie in the same plane as that of young stars near the milky way’s center. the team suggests that both clouds, along with a gas tail that appears to be trailing g2, are all part of a stream of gas that gravity ripped from the envelope of a young star about 100 years earlier. like rocks carried by a swift current, the clouds may be dense lumps embedded in the moving gas stream. there may be additional lumps in the tail that could serve as future snacks for the black hole, known as sagittarius a*. that interpretation is open for debate. but

Cosmic Alignments and Celestial Events

A rare cosmic alignment has occurred, with the orbits of Mars, Earth, and the Sun falling into a straight line. This opposition has sparked interest in astronomical events, particularly total lunar eclipses known as ""blood moons."" According to biblical prophecy, these events may signal significant changes.

Meanwhile, scientists have been studying the universe's mysteries, including dark matter and its effects on galaxies. Recent experiments have recorded excess cosmic ray emissions, which some believe could be evidence of a certain type of dark matter particle collision. However, further research is needed to confirm this theory.

In the outer solar system, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has been exploring the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies left over from the earliest days of the solar system. The spacecraft will soon visit a smaller ice ball, 2014 Mu69, providing a close-up look at another piece of the frigid debris beyond Neptune.

Astronomers have also been tracking asteroids and their potential impact on Earth. A recent warning about objects striking our planet has highlighted the need for precise radar tracking and early warning systems.

In other news, a study has revealed that fast electrons are speeding above Earth's surface at nearly the speed of light. This phenomenon is puzzling, as it doesn't fit current models of space radiation.

As we continue to explore the universe, scientists are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. From gravitational assists to starships, innovative technologies are being developed to help us

Ireland Prepares for Uncertain Future as Cosmic Energy Increases

Cork, Ireland - A public forum on the country's future is set to take place on January 28, amidst growing concerns about the impact of increasing cosmic energy on the nation. The event comes as a warning from an unknown entity suggests that a powerful celestial force is approaching, holding an ultra-high capacity charge.

The warning has sparked widespread anxiety, with many citizens expressing fears about the potential consequences of this energy surge. As the planet Mercury and other celestial bodies align in the heavens, some are speculating about the arrival of Pluto, a ""horrible star"" that may bring catastrophic changes to Ireland's economy and social fabric.

Meanwhile, protests have erupted across the country, with demonstrators calling for a coordinated dismantling of the European Union. The unrest has been fueled by concerns about the impact of economic policies on ordinary citizens.

In response to these growing tensions, government officials have issued statements assuring the public that they are working to address the underlying issues driving the unrest. However, many remain skeptical, and the situation continues to unfold with increasing uncertainty.

As the world waits with bated breath for the arrival of this celestial force, one thing is clear: Ireland's future hangs in the balance, and the consequences of this event will be felt far and wide.

The language used is also more objective and fact-based compared to the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE, which uses phrases like ""White House Under Fire"" and ""controversy has sparked calls for transparency and accountability.""","White House Under Fire Over Benghazi Attack

A growing number of officials and experts are questioning the official narrative surrounding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four American diplomats. Emails obtained by Reuters reveal that the State Department was aware of a possible terrorist attack just two hours after it occurred, contradicting the White House's initial claims.

The emails, sent to multiple government offices, including the White House and Pentagon, mention an Islamic militant group claiming responsibility for the attack. This contradicts the administration's later claim that the attack was sparked by a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islamic video.

US officials have reportedly said that the attack was planned in advance, with Libyan security forces stepping aside to allow militants to attack the consulate. The State Department has since acknowledged that the attack was not a spontaneous protest, but the White House's initial response has been widely criticized as misleading.

The controversy has sparked calls for transparency and accountability from lawmakers and media outlets. ABC News, CNN, and NBC have all joined conservative media in demanding that the White House release all emails surrounding the editing of CIA talking points related to the attack.

As the investigation into the Benghazi attack continues, questions are being raised about the administration's handling of intelligence and its response to the crisis. The incident has become a major embarrassment for President Obama, who is facing intense scrutiny over his administration's actions in the Middle East.","US Diplomatic Security Under Scrutiny

Eight months after a terrorist attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, a House committee is holding another hearing to examine whether the Obama administration mishandled the tragic events. The committee has found two State Department officials who previously had not spoken publicly and are scathingly critical of the administration's response.

The officials, Gregory Hicks and Mark I. Thompson, claim that a more aggressive American military response could have been mounted on the night of the attack. Their testimony is expected to shed light on the security measures in place at the time and whether they were adequate.

Meanwhile, intelligence reports indicate that Osama bin Laden has been planning terrorist attacks in the US since 1997. The President's Daily Brief from August 6, 2001, notes that bin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and ""bring the fighting to America.""

In Libya, a car exploded outside the French embassy in Tripoli just after 7 am, causing widespread damage and injuring no one. The blast was attributed to Islamist militants who suspect France and other Western powers of intervening to seek oil or influence.

The US government has taken steps to address security concerns, including ordering intelligence agencies to streamline how terrorism threats are pursued and analyzed. President Obama also directed the Homeland Security Department to speed up the installation of advanced-technology equipment for passenger screening at American airports.

As the threat from terrorist groups continues to evolve, diplomatic security remains a top concern.

Article 1 - video: obama linked to benghazi attack
(before it's news) we learned tuesday that barack hussein obama, along with the fbi, cia, the state department, and literally hundreds of intelligence-related entities within the federal government knew the benghazi consulate had been attacked by terrorists within two hours. we learned that three emails were sent directly to the white house situation room describing the incident as a terrorist attack. we learned that obama watched in real time and did nothing while four americans were murdered. and while obama and the mainstream media were playing “pin the tail on the youtube video” for two weeks, western journalism had been on top of this story since day one. we knew that a cover-up was occurring from the very beginning. but it was not simply a president who stood by and did nothing while four americans were murdered. not simply a president so myopic that he refused to accept that terrorists, under his “bridge-building” administration, would want to kill us. it was something much more. much more sinister. watch our newest video to find out the real news on the benghazi attack. related posts:

Article 2 - white house media ignores obama’s muslim outreach meltdown
(before it's news) advertisement the press corps asked no questions during monday’s white house press conference about the meltdown of president barack obama‘s high-profile muslim outreach policy. instead, they spent time asking low-impact questions, such as whether officials timed today’s announcement of a new lawsuit against chinese auto part makers to aid the president’s two campaign stops in ohio. they used up the bulk of their limited time throwing softball questions. “it was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn’t out on the course,” asked one reporter, according to a transcript. “is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation [for the presidential debates] at the white house?” “can you give us any guidance or insight into how the president is monitoring the situation in afghanistan?” asked another reporter. the journalists’ names are not included in the transcript. obama’s arab-outreach policy — dubbed “a new beginning” in 2009 – is being shredded as islamist governments, angry populations and jihadi groups compete to demonstrate their hostility to, or distance from, obama’s u.s. government. united states marines are being sent to protect embassies, u.s. diplomats have been withdrawn from the region and the beirut embassy has begun burning classified documents, according to the associated press. even friendly libyan officials publicly dismiss the white house’s claim that the deadly sept. 11, 2012 attack in benghazi was the result of an

Article 4 - obama's waterloo!!!!
from the desk of: mat staver the house intelligence committee is investigating why the obama administration required cia personnel and contractors to sign a second non-disclosure agreement shortly after the benghazi, libya, terrorist attacks of 9/11/12. apparently, the prevention of disclosures was so important to the obama administration that they pulled the recently traumatized personnel aside at a memorial service! the timing sent a clear message to the men and women who witnessed first-hand what the administration was claiming to be a “spontaneous demonstration against an anti-islamic video.” the obama administration has been engaged in a web of deceit since day one of the benghazi attacks. that includes the intimidation of witnesses. please read my very important update below – mat. christopher, their identities undisclosed to the american public, witnesses to the benghazi massacre were ushered into a private room and asked to sign new cia non-disclosure agreements (ndas). they had gathered to honor tyrone woods and glen doherty, the two former navy seals who were killed in a mortar attack while trying to defend the cia annex in benghazi. they were cia personnel and contractors. this was to be a heartfelt memorial service for their fallen comrades, which was interrupted to sign ndas so there would be no mistaking the intent of the obama administration if the truth got out. they were cia personnel and contractors. this was to be a heartfelt memorial service

reviving hillary’s vast right-wing conspiracy (before it's news) remember when bill clinton was still denying his involvement with monica lewinsky, and an indignant hillary went out to face the cameras on his behalf, imagining that his troubles were due to “a vast right-wing conspiracy”? well, fast forward fifteen years and she’s at it again, this time on behalf of her boss, barack obama, the incredible shrinking man who loves to take credit for everything (have you heard that he got osama bin laden?) but finds it impossible to take responsibility for anything (whatever it is, it’s still bush’s fault). following mitt romney’s elegant rope-a-dope of obama in their third and final debate of this election season, during which the republican nominee left the prosecution of the administration’s foreign policy blunders to others during the final days of their race for the white house, the president’s flailing re-election campaign finds itself confronting a whole new set of problems. while relying heavily on the complicity of the mainstream media to aid in a blatant cover-up concerning a planned terrorist attack on the american consulate in benghazi, libya on the anniversary of 9/11, obama has been desperate to run out the clock before voters can learn the truth about his incompetence and deceit. now he must try to explain a newly obtained e-mail message that clearly shows he has been lying all along to the american people about the attack, which killed

dear benghazi hearing critics: don’t americans deserve to learn if they’ve been lied to? (before it's news) yesterday’s benghazi hearings were truly a disappointment. the testimony and the probing questions from the republican members of congress were all up to professional standards, america learned much more about what happen on 9/11/12 (although there is still more to learn). the continual bloviating and political talking points of the democrats were at times disgusting. and as for the press, greg gutfeld said it best when he described the mainstream media as president obama’s “scandal condom.” for the most part the republican’s on the committee avoided the long political oratory of the democrats. and the testimony provided voters with revelations about what happened that horrible day in benghazi and how it differed with the “official” white house account. the biggest revelations were not only were rescue teams not mobilized, nor was permission to fly over libyan territory requested.. one team was actually ordered to stand down. when asked what the special forces members’ reaction was to being told to not intervene greg hicks testified “they were furious. i will quote lt. col. gibson, he said, ‘this is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.’” the story about the anti-muslim video causing the attack was an administration creation. e hillary clinton spoke with deputy chief of

(before it's news) president obama’s once-seemingly-unstoppable march towards reelection hit what he might call “bumps in the road” in benghazi, libya late on september 11, 2012. it might be more accurate to describe the effect of the well-planned and -executed, military-style attack on a diplomatic facility there as the political equivalent of a devastating improvised explosive device on the myth of the unassailability of the obama record as commander-in-chief. thanks to intrepid investigative reporting – notably by bret baier and catherine herridge at fox news, aaron klein at wnd.com and claire lopez at radicalislam.org – and information developed by congressional investigators, the mystery is beginning to unravel with regard to what happened that night and the reason for the subsequent, clumsy official cover-up now known as “benghazigate.” the evidence suggests that the obama administration has not simply been engaging, legitimating, enriching and emboldening islamists who have now taken over or are ascendant in much of the middle east. starting in march 2011, when american diplomat christopher stevens was designated the liaison to the “opposition” in libya, the obama administration has been arming them, including jihadists like abdelhakim belhadj, the leader of the al qaeda franchise known as the libyan islamic fighting group. once qaddafi was overthrown,

Article 1 - house holds hearing on benghazi attack
eight months after four americans died in a terrorist attack on the american diplomatic compound in benghazi, libya, a house committee held another hearing on wednesday to examine whether the obama administration mishandled the tragic events. what follows is an update on what is known about the benghazi episode and why it has become such a political flash point: q. why is the house committee on oversight and government reform holding a new hearing on benghazi? a. committee investigators found two state department officials who previously had not spoken publicly — though their testimony has been previewed in the news media in recent days — and who are scathingly critical of the administration’s response to the sept. 11, 2012, attack. gregory hicks, who was serving as deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in tripoli at the time, is expected to testify that a far more aggressive american military response could have been mounted on the night of the attack. mark i. thompson, the deputy coordinator for operations in the state department’s counterterrorism bureau, has told committee staff members that he argued unsuccessfully that an emergency support team should be dispatched. some of their colleagues disagree with their views on what more could have been done. q. but haven’t the inadequacy of security measures at benghazi and other shortcomings already been addressed in a major report? a. yes. in december, an independent review led by a retired veteran diplomat, thomas r.

Article 3 - car explodes outside french embassy in libya
that hostility may seem incongruous after libyans praised france for its leading role in the western air campaign that saved the libyan insurrection. but even then, many libyans suspected france and the other western powers of intervening to seek oil or influence. and some islamist militants further believe the western powers sought to “seize the revolution” to “recreate libya in a western image of secular democracy,” said prof. george joffe, a libya scholar at cambridge university. the bomb went off just after 7 a.m. a libyan official involved in investigating the crime scene said the blast had taken place when the shift of libyan guards who stand outside was changing, avoiding libyan casualties. the explosion broke the windows and damaged the facades of more than two dozen buildings over an area as wide as 500 yards. plumes of smoke billowed from the burning wreckage of the car, described by the official as a renault, parked by the embassy walls. a burst water main flooded the street. a nearby resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, compared the blast to the worst days of violence during the civil war in iraq. “i lived in baghdad, and i woke up to explosions as big as this one,” she said. “i was knocked out of bed.” as in other recent attacks in libya, no one claimed responsibility. the libyan government vowed “to cooperate with

Article 5 - obama details new policies in response to terror threat
washington  president obama on thursday ordered intelligence agencies to take a series of steps to streamline how terrorism threats are pursued and analyzed, saying the government had to respond aggressively to the failures that allowed a nigerian man to ignite an explosive mixture on a commercial jetliner on christmas day. the president also directed the homeland security department to speed the installation of $1 billion in advanced-technology equipment for the screening of passengers, including body scanners at american airports and to work with international airports to see that they upgrade their own equipment to protect passengers on flights headed to the united states. he said intelligence reports involving threats would be distributed more widely among agencies. he instructed the state department to review its visa policy to make it more difficult for people with connections to terrorism to receive visas, while making it simpler to revoke visas to the united states when questions arise. “we are at war,” mr. obama said, releasing an unclassified version of a report on the attempted attack. he pledged not to “succumb to a siege mentality” sacrificing the country’s civil liberties for security, but he called for expanding the criteria for adding people to terrorism watch lists. the report concluded that the government’s counterterrorism operations had been caught off guard by the sophistication and strength of a qaeda cell in yemen, where officials say the plot against the united states originated. “we didn’t know they had progressed to the point of actually launching individuals here,” said john o. brennan, the president

Article 7 - diplomats pulled 2 ways, between high walls and open doors
when it comes to security at the state department’s 275 diplomatic missions around the globe, a number of which encounter some form of attack each year, the lessons have been hard learned. when the american ambassador to lebanon, maura connelly, went to a concert at a roman temple in the country’s central valley this summer, she traveled in a convoy of five armored sport utility vehicles with smoked glass. the convoy snaked through traffic at high speed during the 90-minute drive over the mountains from beirut, the capital. it was impossible for others on the road to ascertain which vehicle carried the american diplomat to baalbek, a town perhaps better known now for hezbollah and hostages than for its annual music festival. there seemed to be added lebanese government checkpoints along the way, too. such protection measures came through bitter experience in lebanon. after the civil war erupted in 1975, an american ambassador was assassinated after his limousine was hijacked as it crossed a neutral zone in divided beirut, and suicide bombers blew up the american embassy twice. photo those two deadly attacks prompted an overhaul in security measures at diplomatic missions worldwide — measures that proved inadequate to keep the mobs at bay in cairo and benghazi on tuesday and in sana, yemen, on thursday. “state is operating in locations that in reality are essentially war zones or conflict zones, which in the past they would have evacuated,” said michael courts, the acting director

Article 8 - witnesses describe their glimpses of suspects in attacks in kenya
he said he was suspicious enough to memorize their license plate -- kaa 853n -- which the police are still tracing. moments after he returned home and the vehicle pulled away, mr. deche said he felt his mud hut shake from the force of the hotel blast. mr. deche, 39, who is married with six children, provided his account to both kenyan and israeli investigators, who are struggling to find those responsible for the attacks. but other witnesses contacted today had not yet spoken to the authorities. the kenyan police have set up a special telephone hot line and e-mail address to receive information from the public, but as of late today not a single tip had arrived. al qaeda, the terrorist network of osama bin laden, has been widely mentioned as a likely organization behind the attack, but investigators here and in washington said they lacked enough information to establish a definitive link. the kenyan authorities said the israelis had sought permission to send some of the evidence from the bombing and the missile attack to israel for further testing, a request that local investigators clearly resented. ''these guys are experts but we're in charge,'' said a kenyan investigator at the bomb site. but some israeli investigators were clearly chafing at the laid-back manner of their kenyan counterparts, who led reporters through the bombing site today and allowed one journalist to pick up a metal fragment believed to be part of a gas canister used in the bombing

Article 9 - corrections: for the record
because of an editing error, an article on thursday about a deadly bombing outside the united states embassy in sana, yemen, misidentified the militant group that had vowed to retaliate for a yemeni counterterrorism force raid on a qaeda safe house aug. 11. it was the yemeni branch of al qaeda — not islamic jihad, a little-known yemeni group that took responsibility for the embassy attack.

Article 10 - fear of sabotage by mistranslation at guantánamo
pentagon officials are saying very little publicly about the cases, in part because they are still baffled about whether there was a conspiracy to infiltrate the camp, and in part because of the nature of the investigation, a sensitive matter involving military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. top defense officials have yet to explain publicly what any of the accused spies might have been trying to achieve at guantánamo bay, a heavily guarded camp on an american naval base. the most serious charges have been leveled against an air force interpreter, senior airman ahmad i. al-halabi, 24, who is accused of committing espionage by trying to deliver information to syria, including 180 messages from prisoners, many of their names, and flight schedules in and out of the camp. military officials have privately suggested a range of theories, including the possibility that the interpreters sabotaged the interrogations. this theory was first reported by cnn on saturday. one senior air force official said monday that terrorists who might gain inside information from american confederates at the camp could have been trying to disrupt flights to and from the base. another official said that terrorist leaders, by learning from the confederates which prisoners were in custody and what they were telling american interrogators, could try to mitigate the damage to their operations. on one level, each branch of the military is investigating the espionage-related accusations against members of its own service. but a senior defense official said these inquiries were being coordinated as part of

Content: cbs busts obama (and itself): unaired 60 minutes clip proves white house lied about benghazi consulate attack (before it's news) by joel b. pollak cbs news has released a clip of an interview by steve kroft of 60 minutes on sep. 12 with president barack obama that indicates obama knew the assault on the u.s. consulate in benghazi, libya was a premeditated terror attack–and suggests the white house later deceived the public by blaming protests against an anti-islam video. cbs chose not to air the clip for over a month–but did air obama’s attack on romney that same night. obama told kroft that the attack in benghazi was different from the violent protest at the u.s. embassy in cairo: “you’re right that this is not a situation that was exactly the same as what happened in egypt, and my suspicion is, is that there are folks involved in this who were looking to target americans from the start.”

White House Under Fire Over Benghazi Attack

A growing number of officials and experts are questioning the official narrative surrounding the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four American diplomats. Emails obtained by Reuters reveal that the State Department was aware of a possible terrorist attack just two hours after it occurred, contradicting the White House's initial claims.

The emails, sent to multiple government offices, including the White House and Pentagon, mention an Islamic militant group claiming responsibility for the attack. This contradicts the administration's later claim that the attack was sparked by a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islamic video.

US officials have reportedly said that the attack was planned in advance, with Libyan security forces stepping aside to allow militants to attack the consulate. The State Department has since acknowledged that the attack was not a spontaneous protest, but the White House's initial response has been widely criticized as misleading.

The controversy has sparked calls for transparency and accountability from lawmakers and media outlets. ABC News, CNN, and NBC have all joined conservative media in demanding that the White House release all emails surrounding the editing of CIA talking points related to the attack.

As the investigation into the Benghazi attack continues, questions are being raised about the administration's handling of intelligence and its response to the crisis. The incident has become a major embarrassment for President Obama, who is facing intense scrutiny over his administration's actions in the Middle East.

US Diplomatic Security Under Scrutiny

Eight months after a terrorist attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, a House committee is holding another hearing to examine whether the Obama administration mishandled the tragic events. The committee has found two State Department officials who previously had not spoken publicly and are scathingly critical of the administration's response.

The officials, Gregory Hicks and Mark I. Thompson, claim that a more aggressive American military response could have been mounted on the night of the attack. Their testimony is expected to shed light on the security measures in place at the time and whether they were adequate.

Meanwhile, intelligence reports indicate that Osama bin Laden has been planning terrorist attacks in the US since 1997. The President's Daily Brief from August 6, 2001, notes that bin Laden implied in U.S. television interviews that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Center bomber Ramzi Yousef and ""bring the fighting to America.""

In Libya, a car exploded outside the French embassy in Tripoli just after 7 am, causing widespread damage and injuring no one. The blast was attributed to Islamist militants who suspect France and other Western powers of intervening to seek oil or influence.

The US government has taken steps to address security concerns, including ordering intelligence agencies to streamline how terrorism threats are pursued and analyzed. President Obama also directed the Homeland Security Department to speed up the installation of advanced-technology equipment for passenger screening at American airports.

The world of mobile payments is experiencing a significant shift, with major players like Google and PayPal vying for dominance. Just days after announcing its new mobile payment service, Google has found itself at the center of controversy, with PayPal suing the company over allegations of employee poaching.

PayPal claims that two former employees with close ties to an undisclosed mobile payment system were hired by Google, potentially stealing trade secrets. However, many believe this is a case of preventing competition rather than seeking actual damages.

Meanwhile, small businesses are embracing mobile payments as a way to compete with larger corporations. Square, a credit processing device developed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has made it possible for anyone to accept debit and credit payments on the spot.

A recent survey conducted by eBay India found that 92% of respondents prefer shopping on their phones during the festive season, citing convenience as the primary reason. This trend is expected to continue, with experts predicting a significant shift in Point-of-Sale (POS) systems over the next year.

As mobile payments become increasingly popular, security concerns are also on the rise. Biometric authentication and tokenization are being used to protect transactions, making it more difficult for hackers to access sensitive information.

With PayPal unveiling new services, including a payment code that allows customers to check in at stores using their smartphones, the future of mobile payments looks bright. As consumers become more comfortable with mobile payments, businesses will need to adapt to meet the changing demands of their customers.

The rise of mobile payments is set to revolutionize the way we shop and pay, offering convenience, security, and flexibility. As this technology continues to evolve, it's clear that a new era of commerce has begun.","Indian Merchants to Benefit from New Point-of-Sale Solution

In a move aimed at increasing accessibility for small merchants, a leading mobile payment and commerce platform has released an updated app-based point-of-sale solution. The new system allows merchants to accept card payments directly on their phones, making it easier for them to cater to the growing demand for alternative payment methods.

The development comes in the wake of India's recent demonetization, which saw the removal of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation. As a result, many small merchants were forced to find ways to quickly accept alternative payment methods to avoid losing out on potential sales.

According to industry experts, this new solution is particularly useful for small merchants who may not have the capabilities to accept card payments but are interested in doing so. The platform's move is also seen as an effort to capitalize on the growing trend of consumers embracing alternative forms of payment.

Meanwhile, in other news, a major wireless carrier has announced that it will waive its cancellation fee for customers who want to drop their phone plans by the end of July. This move is seen as a response to recent rate increases and is expected to benefit thousands of customers.

In related news, a new report has highlighted the growing trend of people using their smartphones primarily for personal reasons, such as entertainment. The study found that 73% of iPhone owners use their devices mainly for leisure activities, while only 59% of other smartphone users do so.

As consumers become increasingly tech-savvy, companies are adapting to meet their needs. For example, a new service has been launched that allows users to shop on their mobile phones, with plans to expand to more carriers in the future.

In another development, the UK government has announced a fuel duty freeze, which is expected to save the average driver £130 per year. The move is seen as a response to concerns about rising fuel prices and is likely to be welcomed by motorists.

Finally, a new initiative has been launched to provide internet access to underserved communities in India. The project aims to promote digital literacy and provide free services such as news articles, health information, and job listings. However, critics have raised concerns about the project's potential impact on Facebook's business model.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

additional titles playing cards grocery store ""loyalty cards"" or big brother? mary starrett february 13, 2003 newswithviews.com i spent a few hours at safeway this past saturday, along with thousands of other americans. only difference is, i wasn't there to shop. i was protesting the use of customer ""loyalty cards"". our merry band was on a mission: to try and explain why those shiny, numbered cards do anything but save you money..(they don't , more on that in a minute). the cards register you, and your purchases and keep track of them for a reason. why it's just another marketing tool you say? hardly. it costs roughly $$30 million dollars to establish one of these card programs and an average $$5 million per year just to keep it going. must be more to this than the desire to save you 40 cents on kitty litter. i must admit i have a shiny, numbered card for just about every store that offers one. i thought i could beat their system by using a fake name and identifying information when i signed up.in fact the stores will often encourage hesitant customers to use fake info... because they know something you don't know. say you sign up as mickey mouse at 1234-main street. you think they don't know it's really you.you get the super deals on toilet paper without having to give anything up, right? wrong. the first time you use a check or

Article 9 - how mobile payments deliver security
how mobile payments deliver security (before it's news) jason oxman september 17, 2014 - in light of the recent apple pay announcement, there has been a lot of buzz around the security of mobile payments. apple pay illustrates a series of defenses that make mobile a natural choice for secure payments. to get started using apple pay, a consumer can simply take a picture of their credit card or link to a card previously stored in the user’s apple account. at that point, they’re ready to pay – not using the digits printed on the card, but using a device account number provided through the payment network or issuing bank associated with the card. the device account number is stored in the phone’s secure element, a chip that can emulate a contactless emv transaction. the secure element hosts authorization, and is considered safer than magnetic stripe technology. when an individual is ready to make a purchase, they will unlock their device with their fingerprint, using apple’s “touch id” feature. biometrics have long been touted as one of the best safeguards in payments – your unique fingerprint simply can’t be hacked. once unlocked the customer simply taps their phone to the merchant’s payment terminal, completing the transaction. apple pay utilizes nfc (near-field communication) to communicate and exchange data. the data is tokenized – meaning that it takes the form of a code exclusively applicable to a particular transaction, and therefore is impervious to data theft. even if a merchant’s system is bree

Article 1 - paytm makes update to target indian merchants (baba)
the payments industry explained: the trends creating new winners and losers in the card-processing ecosystem this story was delivered to bi intelligence "" payments briefing "" subscribers. to learn more and subscribe, please click here . alibaba-backed mobile payment and commerce platform paytm, a leader in india's mobile-wallet market, released an updated app-based point-of-sale (pos) solution that gives merchants the ability to accept card payments directly on their phones, according to mashable. the app will be particularly useful for small merchants in india who are unlikely to have the capabilities to accept card payments but might be interested in beginning to do so. that's particularly true in the wake of india's recent demonetization, in which the country removed 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation. these notes represented 86% of currency in circulation for the country, according to quartz. for small merchants that likely did most of their sales in cash, finding ways to quickly accept alternative payment methods, particularly as consumer payment habits change to accommodate the shift, will be important in order to avoid losing out on potential sales amid the cash crunch. following demonetization, indian consumers are quickly embracing alternative forms of payment paytm saw immediate growth after demonetization. paytm posted 1,000% growth in money added to the mobile wallet, a 300% rise in app downloads, and an increase from three transactions per user per week to 18 over a three-week period following the change. consumers

Article 2 - jumping ship (or not); in a rare limited offer, at&t waives its cancellation fee
tucked into every at&t wireless subscriber's latest bill was a notice announcing two rate increases. in the fine print was an unusual exit clause: because of the changes, customers have until the end of july to drop their phone plans without paying the customary cancellation fee. ''when you make changes in service, it's only right to offer the opportunity to cancel,'' said david p. caouette, a spokesman for at&t wireless, the nation's third-largest wireless phone carrier. he added that the rate increases, which affect only some customers, would bring the company in line with competitors who bill similar charges. ''on balance, we're confident that our service remains competitive and a good value for customers,'' he said. the increases are fairly small: a directory assistance call will rise from 99 cents to $1.25, and a charge will be imposed for calls that go unanswered for more than 30 seconds, which used to be free. but the effect on at&t wireless could be significant, considering that any of the company's 19 million customers could take the opportunity to cancel. mr. caouette said that at&t had no idea how many customers would take advantage of the offer. but since most wireless carriers require a yearlong commitment and charge at least $150 for ending a contract early -- $175 in at&t's case -- the opportunity to cancel without consequences could be the cellular equivalent of a ''get out of jail free'' card in monopoly. this year the federal

Article 3 - using the iphone mostly for play
do you treat your iphone as a guilty pleasure? you're not alone. a new report from compete surveying the behavior of 600 smartphone users found that 73 percent of iphone owners used their mobile devices primarily for personal reasons, like entertainment. by comparison, 59 percent of owners with other types of smartphones -- from manufacturers like htc, research in motion and nokia -- primarily used their devices for business and work-related needs. ''traditionally, you had a smartphone because you needed to do mobile e-mail,'' said danielle nohe, a research director at compete. ''but now people using it for personal productivity. there's a broader range of people who have reasons to use a smartphone.'' for example, some iphone owners might use their handsets instead of an in-car navigation system. some might use their iphones instead of a netbook, a point timothy cook, the chief operating office of apple, made during the company's second-quarter earnings call last week. in general, ms. nohe said, iphone owners were more likely to plunk down the digital change to buy more applications -- and they have 25,000 applications to choose from, because of the wildfire popularity of the app store among developers. jenna wortham comment:a more accurate account is that the iphone is used for personal productivity and business, whereas the others use it primarily for business because the machines people buy on those platforms have few personal productivity/media/life apps. when they do, and

Article 5 - update 1-australian regulator opposes collective bank bargaining on apple pay
company news 6:57pm est update 1-australian regulator opposes collective bank bargaining on apple pay (adds bank names, bank comment, digital wallet context) sydney nov 29 three of australia's four biggest banks will be barred from collectively bargaining with apple inc in relation to its mobile digital payments system, under a draft decision released by the antitrust regulator on tuesday. the australian competition and consumer commission said letting banks collectively offer their own integrated digital wallets in apple iphones, in competition with apple's apple pay system, would reduce each bank's ability to negotiate with the u.s. firm. ""while the accc accepts that the opportunity for the banks to collectively negotiate and boycott would place them in a better bargaining position with apple, the benefits are currently uncertain and may be limited,"" commission chairman rod sims said in a statement. the decision is a setback for the banks' hopes to bypass apple's in-house payments system and roll out their own versions free of competition from the silicon valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in australia. it also sets a precedent which may solidify apple's dominance of the digital wallet system globally, since the australian banks had mounted the first challenge to it. apple pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iphones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to australia last year. commonwealth

Article 6 - those born to shop can now use cellphones

""these kinds of services are still pretty new in the u.s.,"" said chris donlay, an ebay spokesman, ""so i think it'll take a while to get some critical mass, but people are using our service, and they seem to like it."" the initiative costs ebay little. the company commissioned bonfire media, a technology company based in los altos, calif., to build the free site, and bonfire built the premium application on its own. ebay, bonfire and the cellphone companies share the revenue for the premium version, which has attracted tens of thousands of users, according to bonfire. the company said hundreds of thousands of people had used the free version. one of ebay's challengers, overstock.com, which sells travel services and products for fixed prices and at auction, also recently forayed deeper into the wireless realm. in november it started mobile o, where cellphone users can use their phones to

Article 8 - facebook’s internet for all is a tough sell in india
the skepticism of phone sellers like mr. khan and the weaknesses of facebook’s indian partner are just two of the problems that have bedeviled mr. zuckerberg’s project so far. internet.org’s free services — which include news articles, health and job information and a text-only version of facebook — are deliberately stripped down to minimize data use and the cost to the phone company. facebook says the primary goal is to show people what the internet is all about. but many indians want more and complain that, contrary to its altruistic claims, the project is simply a way to get them onto facebook and to sign up for paid plans from reliance. photo internet activists have also attacked facebook, accusing it of cherry-picking partners to include in its walled garden rather than simply offering a small amount of free access to the whole internet. their concerns have struck a chord with the indian government, which is considering new rules that would govern such free services. mr. zuckerberg declined several requests to discuss internet.org. but he remains passionate about his crusade. “internet access needs to be treated as an important enabler of human rights and human potential,” he told the united nations last month. the internet.org suite, rebranded last month as free basics, is now in 25 countries, from indonesia to panama. facebook is investing heavily in other parts of the project, including experiments to deliver cheap wi-fi to remote villages and to beam internet service from high-flying drones.

Content: mobile payments vs. mobile pos payments race is on! – a spn exclusive article % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) can anyone catch square with their $$4 billion + a month head start? the answer probably lies somewhere between paypal and another mobile pos payment solution. if you’re the owner or manager of a small to medium sized business, a key part of our national economic engine, then you recognize the importance of mobile and using today’s technology; and you want to utilize it and capitalize on the opportunity that it presents, however you’re not quite clear on a few things. you’ve tried paypal sometime back and you were astonished at what you found out. in order to use paypal you must first accept their terms of service. by doing so, you in effect waive your rights to credit card consumer protection laws and you acknowledge that you cannot issue a chargeback for unauthorized use of your credit card and paypal account. if you do, they have the right to limit your account. ‘phishing’ complaints signify the fraud problem to be rampant and your account can easily be compromised if you’re not very careful. if a criminal accesses your account, paypal will hold you monetarily and legally responsible. paypal can, will, and has in the past, completely cleaned out customer accounts, including checking and/or savings accounts, without any appeals process available. buried in the fine print of their “terms of service”, they disclose to you that paypal can close your account for any reason what so ever, or no reason, and then you have to wait 180 days to get your money. think that’ll never happen? think again. that’s what everyone thinks until it happens to them. it’s hard to run a business that way, that’s for sure. if you’re a fine up-standing individual with hundreds of successful transactions, and someone pays you with a stolen credit card, your account is immediately flagged as being involved in “criminal behavior” and any money in that account can be, and often is, frozen and confiscated. if a customer disputes the charge, the same thing has happened. paypal claims that they will fight chargebacks, however horror stories to the contrary abound. there are websites claiming over 10,000,000 visitors dedicated to exposing how bad the paypal customer service is. (see paypalsucks.com) square seems to be headed in a slightly more customer and business friendly direction, or at least they may be in the future, however they’re very pricey for a business. card present swipe rates are 2.75%, card-not-present (cnp) rates are 3.5% + $$0.15 per transaction. processing limits make conducting a busy brick & mortar business a real challenge, to say the least. for instance, as a first time or new square user, you can’t process over $$1000 in transactions per week. all funds processed in one week over $$1000 will

Indian Merchants to Benefit from New Point-of-Sale Solution

In a move aimed at increasing accessibility for small merchants, a leading mobile payment and commerce platform has released an updated app-based point-of-sale solution. The new system allows merchants to accept card payments directly on their phones, making it easier for them to cater to the growing demand for alternative payment methods.

The development comes in the wake of India's recent demonetization, which saw the removal of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation. As a result, many small merchants were forced to find ways to quickly accept alternative payment methods to avoid losing out on potential sales.

According to industry experts, this new solution is particularly useful for small merchants who may not have the capabilities to accept card payments but are interested in doing so. The platform's move is also seen as an effort to capitalize on the growing trend of consumers embracing alternative forms of payment.

Meanwhile, in other news, a major wireless carrier has announced that it will waive its cancellation fee for customers who want to drop their phone plans by the end of July. This move is seen as a response to recent rate increases and is expected to benefit thousands of customers.

In related news, a new report has highlighted the growing trend of people using their smartphones primarily for personal reasons, such as entertainment. The study found that 73% of iPhone owners use their devices mainly for leisure activities, while only 59% of other smartphone users do so.

""Mobile Payments on the Rise: A New Era of Convenience""

The world of mobile payments is experiencing a significant shift, with major players like Google and PayPal vying for dominance. Just days after announcing its new mobile payment service, Google has found itself at the center of controversy, with PayPal suing the company over allegations of employee poaching.

PayPal claims that two former employees with close ties to an undisclosed mobile payment system were hired by Google, potentially stealing trade secrets. However, many believe this is a case of preventing competition rather than seeking actual damages.

Meanwhile, small businesses are embracing mobile payments as a way to compete with larger corporations. Square, a credit processing device developed by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has made it possible for anyone to accept debit and credit payments on the spot.

A recent survey conducted by eBay India found that 92% of respondents prefer shopping on their phones during the festive season, citing convenience as the primary reason. This trend is expected to continue, with experts predicting a significant shift in Point-of-Sale (POS) systems over the next year.

As mobile payments become increasingly popular, security concerns are also on the rise. Biometric authentication and tokenization are being used to protect transactions, making it more difficult for hackers to access sensitive information.

With PayPal unveiling new services, including a payment code that allows customers to check in at stores using their smartphones, the future of mobile payments looks bright. As consumers become more comfortable with mobile payments, businesses will need to adapt

The NFC East, one of the most dominant divisions in the NFL, has seen a decline in performance this season. The Giants are the only team with a winning record, while the Cowboys and Eagles have struggled to live up to their expectations.

This Sunday's matchup between the Cowboys and Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field promises to be a thrilling game. The Cowboys, led by rookie running back DeMarco Murray, look to bounce back from a tough loss last week. Meanwhile, the Eagles are seeking to prove themselves as a legitimate contender after a disappointing start to the season.

In other news, the Rams have not been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, despite their recent struggles. A win over the Buccaneers could be just what they need to get back on track.

Meanwhile, in the NFC West, the 49ers are looking to take down the Steelers and move closer to a Super Bowl berth. The Patriots, meanwhile, are favored to take down the Broncos in a battle of two of the league's top teams.

As the playoffs approach, teams are starting to make their cases for a spot in the postseason. But with so many talented teams vying for a spot, it's anyone's game. Will the Cowboys and Eagles be able to turn things around and make a deep run? Only time will tell.","NFL Playoff Race Heats Up as Teams Battle for Position

With five weeks remaining in the season, the NFL playoff race is heating up. The Chicago Bears have taken a significant lead in the NFC North, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 31-26 and moving ahead of their arch-rivals, the Green Bay Packers.

The Saints, meanwhile, are looking to make a statement as they host the Vikings on Sunday. With a rock-solid foundation at quarterback, coach, and front office, New Orleans is one of the model teams in the NFC. The team's ability to sustain success has been key to their recent success, with quarterback Drew Brees leading the charge.

In other news, the Rams have proven themselves to be a force to be reckoned with, beating the Denver Broncos 36-33 on the road and moving into a tie for first place in the NFC West. The Seahawks are also looking strong, having outscored teams by 14 points this season despite a losing record.

The playoffs are shaping up to be a thrilling ride, with several teams vying for a spot. The Saints' recent success has given them a realistic shot at making a return trip to the Super Bowl, while the Vikings are looking to turn their season around after a dismal start.

nfl week twelve preview – san francisco at new orleans % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) last season it was maybe the game of the year when the saints and 49ers dueled it out in the divisional round of the playoffs. sunday, the two teams hope they can re-create that kind of excitement when the two teams meet in a huge nfc showdown in the superdome in new orleans. right now there’s a huge question mark for the niners, as there’s still no word on if it will be alex smith or colin kaepernick starting at qb for san fran. smith made some huge throws in the 36-32 win over the saints in the playoff game last season, including a 14-yard touchdown pass to vernon davis with nine seconds left. the niners qb is likely to sit with a concussion he suffered nov. 11 against st. louis. kaepernick impressed in his first career start, going 16 of 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns and no turnovers against a bears defense that had forced 30 in its first nine games. click here to read the rest! source:

Article 6 - a messy foot race
a messy foot race (before it's news) courtesy of sbnation.com a few teams that we expected lumbered into the playoffs like behemoths: chiefs, seahawks, and the broncos. it is the under-the-radar teams that often make the largest splash on the way to the lombardi trophy. i had talked briefly about the curse of the “best record” and wild card weekend has historically produced little engines that could that stumble, frothing and foaming, into a super bowl berth. we need not look back very far to see that the ravens were scheduled for a mediocre season last year before lady luck seemed to bless their every pass. 49ers fans are still embittered and steelers fans groans at the mention of ray lewis and the baltimore ravens; yet, there is a cautionary tale there. do not fall asleep on a hungry team that did not have the benefit of a soft schedule during the regular season. my team, the patriots, is notorious for being gifted the easiest schedule on the books––and i can vividly recall two upstart giants teams barreling their way through the playoff and embarrassing the brady bunch. so, seahawks and broncos fans, you are on notice: regular season dominance does not a championship make. i spent some time in arizona over the holidays and headed over to laughlin to where the living dead walk to make some football bets. nothing is more sobering

Article 8 - 2012 expectations
2012 expectations (before it's news) the rams finished up the 2011 season a disappointing 2-14. a lot of moves have been made in the off season to try and get the team back on track. (see http://www.ramsgab.com/2012/07/12/2012-off-season-improvements/) rams fans everywhere would love to have some kind of reasonable expectation for the year to come, but there are so many variables it’s impossible to say. what will we get from a dynamic new head coach, a healing (once star rookie) quarterback, a slew of roster changes, and several unproven newly acquired offensive weapons? (if you know let me know and we will both go to vegas.) in 2010 another nfc team went 2-14. it was the carolina panthers. the panthers fired head coach john fox and brought in veteran defensive coach ron rivera as the team’s new head coach (interesting to note that both rivera and jeff fisher played on the 1985 super bowl winning chicago bears team). in the 2011 off season the team made a lot of on field personnel changes including their veteran kicker (sound familiar?). their first draft pick was used picking up qb sensation and heisman trophy winner cam newton. newton had an exhilarating season breaking rookie passing records (a lot of similarities to recent rams history). unfortunately, these exciting games only

Article 9 - nfl down $500 million in ad revenue, but is political football the only thing to blame?
nfl down $500 million in ad revenue, but is political football the only thing to blame? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the nfl is hemorrhaging money right now, at a rate that could add up to a $500 million loss in revenue compared to last year. that revenue loss is being felt by the tv networks that carry nfl games, cbs, espn, fox, and nbc. but revenue losses for networks mean significantly reduced tv contracts for the nfl. one of the main factors in that loss of revenue has been a 20% drop in audience since 2015, the year the nfl saw a peak in viewership. many will look at the nfl’s recent spate of national anthem protests as the main culprit behind this decline. the protests began last season when then-san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick took a new while the national anthem played. to be sure, the nfl is most likely getting some blowback from the protests and from the nfl’s initial support of the protests, as well as the nfl’s continued mixed reaction to the protests. but does that alone explain the loss in ratings, which equals a loss in revenue? there may be other factors coming in to play that are leading to the loss in ratings for the nfl. one of those factors could very well be the rules changes designed to protect players, changes that happened as a result of discoveries made about the ongoing issues that players suffer as a result of conc

getting to know you it is the third time around this season for the colts and the miami dolphins, rivals in the american football conference east who will play in miami on saturday. each team was defeated by the other at home this season, and miami hopes to derail that trend. the game is reduced to indianapolis's strong offense against miami's strong defense. ''i don't think teams in the playoffs are eager to play divisional teams, and especially in the first round,'' dolphins cornerback terrell buckley said. ''you know nearly everything about each other. i mean, you can hardly sneeze without the other team expecting it. it's a matter of who is going to do what they do best.'' look for a playoff trick or two. creativity is the buzzword here. a familiar face here come the rams. they had stood on the outside looking in but slipped through on the final day of the regular season. now the playoffs include the rams, a team with super bowl experience and the league's best offense, as the national football conference's sixth and final seeded team. like the colts and dolphins, the rams will play a division team for the third time, the saints. the teams will be facing one another in consecutive weeks in the same stadium, after the rams tripped up the saints by 26-21 in new orleans on sunday. the teams split their first two encounters, with each winning on the road.

NFL Divisional Showdowns: A Tale of Two Teams

The NFC East, one of the most dominant divisions in the NFL, has seen a decline in performance this season. The Giants are the only team with a winning record, while the Cowboys and Eagles have struggled to live up to their expectations.

This Sunday's matchup between the Cowboys and Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field promises to be a thrilling game. The Cowboys, led by rookie running back DeMarco Murray, look to bounce back from a tough loss last week. Meanwhile, the Eagles are seeking to prove themselves as a legitimate contender after a disappointing start to the season.

In other news, the Rams have not been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, despite their recent struggles. A win over the Buccaneers could be just what they need to get back on track.

Meanwhile, in the NFC West, the 49ers are looking to take down the Steelers and move closer to a Super Bowl berth. The Patriots, meanwhile, are favored to take down the Broncos in a battle of two of the league's top teams.

As the playoffs approach, teams are starting to make their cases for a spot in the postseason. But with so many talented teams vying for a spot, it's anyone's game. Will the Cowboys and Eagles be able to turn things around and make a deep run? Only time will tell.

NFL Playoff Race Heats Up as Teams Battle for Position

With five weeks remaining in the season, the NFL playoff race is heating up. The Chicago Bears have taken a significant lead in the NFC North, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 31-26 and moving ahead of their arch-rivals, the Green Bay Packers.

The Saints, meanwhile, are looking to make a statement as they host the Vikings on Sunday. With a rock-solid foundation at quarterback, coach, and front office, New Orleans is one of the model teams in the NFC. The team's ability to sustain success has been key to their recent success, with quarterback Drew Brees leading the charge.

In other news, the Rams have proven themselves to be a force to be reckoned with, beating the Denver Broncos 36-33 on the road and moving into a tie for first place in the NFC West. The Seahawks are also looking strong, having outscored teams by 14 points this season despite a losing record.

The playoffs are shaping up to be a thrilling ride, with several teams vying for a spot. The Saints' recent success has given them a realistic shot at making a return trip to the Super Bowl, while the Vikings are looking to turn their season around after a dismal start.

As the teams battle it out, one thing is clear: only 31 teams will make it to the end of the season. Will your team be among them?

A Broward County judge lost his cool during a hearing, chastising an attorney for invoking police brutality as a reason for his client's actions. The incident occurred when the client allegedly shot at a police officer and fled to hide under a boat dock wearing a firearm holster.

The defense argued that the client was scared of being targeted by police due to recent high-profile cases of unarmed black men being killed by law enforcement. However, the judge dismissed this argument, stating it had nothing to do with the case at hand.

Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a well-known marijuana activist was targeted by police for running a business that sold chicken wings after 11 pm. The city has an ordinance requiring food establishments to close by certain times.

In another incident, a 62-year-old man with three forms of Lou Gehrig's disease was falsely arrested and brutally tortured. The victim, who is the longest living person with these diseases, claims he was subjected to electronic harassment while in prison.

A police union is suing after officers had their cellphones searched without a warrant during a criminal investigation. The lawsuit cites ""widespread, ongoing, and unconstitutional searches"" of private cellphones.

In a bizarre incident, a mother was arrested at a children's splash park for wearing a wet shirt that showed her padded bra. She claims she was targeted due to the embarrassing situation, which turned into a case of obstruction of justice and resisting arrest without violence.

These incidents highlight issues with police brutality, harassment, and abuse of power. They also raise questions about the limits of government authority and the importance of open meetings and transparency in law enforcement.","Corruption and Crime Sweep Through US Cities

A recent wave of corruption and crime has swept through several major cities in the United States, leaving a trail of destruction and despair. In Camden, New Jersey, the city's third mayor in five years was convicted of corruption charges, sparking widespread outrage.

The case highlights a broader issue of corruption in local government, with 16 other men behind bars awaiting sentencing for narcotics and organized crime. The investigation has also led to allegations of police misconduct, with several officers implicated in the crackdown.

In New York City, a prominent prosecutor resigned amid lawsuit woes, leaving many wondering if the district attorney's office existed more in form than in fact. Meanwhile, in California, a suspect was arrested in connection with the abduction and killing of a young girl, bringing closure to her family after a lengthy manhunt.

In other news, a Penn State student's dying hours were captured on video, revealing a disturbing pattern of hazing and reckless behavior by fraternity members. The case has led to charges against 18 students, including eight facing involuntary manslaughter.

In a separate incident, a detective was cleared of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a driver, but his colleagues have faced criticism for their role in the events leading up to the tragedy.

As authorities continue to investigate and prosecute corruption and crime, many are left wondering how such abuses of power can occur in institutions meant to serve and protect.

a broward county judge lost his cool after a public defender argued that his african-american client ran from the cops because he was scared he would be a victim of police brutality. twenty-six-year-old steven clarke fled after allegedly shooting at an officer, and was later found hiding under a boat dock wearing a firearm holster. “your honor, in light of what’s happening in this country with unarmed black men being killed by police, him running from shots being fired is a very reasonable response,” public defender dale miller argued in front of judge john “jay” hurley. “don’t give me that,” hurley hollered at miller. “that is so off base.” as miller attempted to argue his case, hurley cut him off, chastising the public defender. “we’ve got a young man, i don’t care what color he is, he’s in a neighborhood he doesn’t live in at 1:41 in the morning, hiding under somebody’s dock in the water with a holster on after a police officer had a shot taken at him,” hurley said, recounting steven clarke’s arrest. “don’t hand me this, ‘running from police brutality,’…that is not appropriate in this case. i’m not going to let you poison this case with bringing in something that has nothing to do with it,” he said. source: rare

Article 4 - “sovereign citizens” and government’s monopoly on crime
“sovereign citizens” and government’s monopoly on crime (before it's news) by william n. grigg brandon paudert was an officer in the west memphis, arkansas police department. at the time brandon was killed, robert was the town’s police chief; brandon’s partner, officer bill evans, was his cousin. until about 11:00 a.m. on that fatal day, officers paudert and evans, who were assigned to the narcotics interdiction team, had maintained surveillance on what they considered to be a “suspicious” rental truck. it turned out that the vehicle wasn’t being used to ferry narcotics; it was filled with household possessions belonging to a pleasant grandmother who was probably puzzled by the unwanted attention she had received from the local police. chief paudert, who had been called to the scene, chided his son and his nephew and told them to “get off their butts and back on the interstate,” where they had a better chance of finding a vehicle carrying contraband – or perhaps a sizeable amount of cash that could be seized and “forfeited.” crittenden county, where west memphis is located, has become notorious for this officially sanctioned variety of highway robbery. a few minutes after hitting the highway, evans spied a white minivan with unusual license plates and conducted a traffic stop. he called brandon to back him up as he went to interrogate the

Article 5 - close to home, part 2: dc’s open meetings act
close to home, part 2: dc’s open meetings act (before it's news) by the sunlight foundation although we preach the importance of public meetings, we recognize that there are some legitimate frustrations to be had with their openness. for instance, a lot of public meetings are boring. and long. and, critics are right: public meetings aren’t necessarily the best format for every single deliberation made by a governing body. but most of these “issues” are besides the point. as our policy guy, john, noted, the need for public meetings doesn’t mean that every conversation needs to happen in public, but that all the official meetings should. that’s the basis behind our push to open up the meetings of the “super committee” — the body created by congress to deal with our national debt — and an important factor to consider in the arrests made at a dc local gov meeting in june. i wrote about the event shortly after it happened, but the quick version goes like this: two reporters were arrested by park police at a taxicab commission public meeting at the request of members of the commission: the first for taking photographs of the meeting. the second, for filming the arrest of the first. the charge? disorderly conduct and unlawful entry…which, at a public meeting (and with video evidence of how they actually acted), is absurd. thankfully, the charges have since been dropped and there’s been a lot of conversation about the future of the taxicab commission

(before it's news) news suppression in action by dc dave these three items in the weekly chantilly times, the first a guest article and the latter two letters to the editor, reveal an alternative technique for denying justice to that employed in the vince foster case. in the foster case, the government version of the truth monopolized the media. those of us who had looked into the matter and found the government story to be as full of holes as a swiss cheese were relegated to the internet. the government story has even more holes in the case of the “suicide” of tommy burkett, whose autopsy, like foster’s, was performed by dr. james beyer. since burkett was not a high government official, the authorities, which include the very powerful washington post, have been able to get by with a quite straightforward public-be-damned and justice-be-damned approach. the news suppression in this case has not been total. it has not had to be. as you can see below, the burkett story was reported nationally on unsolved mysteries and the local free weekly, the chantilly times (now the fairfax times), has covered the story quite thoroughly. this limited coverage and the lack of results it has brought illustrate very well the observation by the late paul goodman: “in america, you can say anything you want as long as it has no effect.” by the way, notice that unlike all other letter writers to the chant

Article 1 - a mayor's fateful journey from camden's streets to jail; caught up in the city's tangle of corruption
''the evidence,'' he said, ''has shown that milton milan is a one-man crime spree.'' but camden's problems did not begin with mr. milan, who was removed from the office he had held since 1997. in this city, which has long been new jersey's poorest, mr. milan is the third mayor of the last five to be convicted of corruption charges. sixteen other camden men are behind bars awaiting sentencing in the crackdown against narcotics and organized crime. as mr. milan waits for his sentence, investigators are expected to start questioning him about other crimes he may have information about, dangling the hope of a reduced sentence as the reward for cooperation. using the same tactics, they obtained damaging testimony against mr. milan from men arrested earlier in the same crackdown. and the former mayor's problems did not end with his conviction. he is still a suspect in the unsolved killing of francisco chamorro, a heroin dealer known as poncho who was shot by three men as he was parking his car in camden on christmas eve 1988. mr. milan has admitted to investigators that he was part of a street fight involving associates of mr. chamorro. police officials believe that the fight, in turn, led to the killing of mr. chamorro as an act of revenge. and investigators say mr. milan may yet be linked to other crimes as they focus on members of the camden police department who have been implicated in the crackdown.

Experts warn that this reluctance to seek assistance can have serious consequences, particularly in areas such as debt counseling. Without support, individuals may find themselves stuck in a cycle of financial struggles, with limited options for recovery.

On the other hand, embracing vulnerability and seeking help can be a powerful tool for growth and connection. By acknowledging our limitations and asking for aid when needed, we can build stronger relationships and foster a sense of community.

In fact, some organizations are now incorporating emotional connections into their customer surveys, aiming to create a more personal and meaningful experience for guests. This approach recognizes that the people behind the brand can make all the difference in determining satisfaction and loyalty.

Meanwhile, individuals are also taking steps to reclaim control over their online presence. By reviewing and adjusting their privacy settings on social media platforms, users can better manage who sees their content and when.

As we navigate this complex digital landscape, it's essential to remember that technology is not a substitute for human connection. In fact, many experts argue that our reliance on robots and artificial intelligence has led to a decline in meaningful relationships and a sense of disconnection.

By embracing vulnerability and seeking help when needed, we can build stronger connections with others and create a more compassionate world.

Article 2 - why is asking for help so difficult?
“there is a tendency to act as if it’s a deficiency,” said garret keizer, author of “help: the original human dilemma” (harpercollins, 2004). “that is exacerbated if a business environment is highly competitive within as well as without. there is an understandable fear that if you let your guard down, you’ll get hurt, or that this information you don’t know how to do will be used against you.” the danger, however, is that stalling can let the situation grow from a problem into a crisis. credit counselors see that all the time. caryn bilotta, manager of education services at advantage credit counseling services, based in pittsburgh, said people waited too long to seek help. “people don’t want to think about it. they don’t know how to handle it.” had they sought assistance earlier, she said, her organization could have worked with them on budget counseling, instead of how to get out of debt. also, ms. klaver said, it is “very hard to sound centered and grounded” when coming from a place of panic. “people like some advance notice,” she said. “it’s like the people who call for a loan for rent on the first of the month rather than a week before. and then it costs me more money to make the immediate transfer. it drives me crazy.” although it is always dangerous to generalize (i can see the e-mail messages coming my way), it

Article 4 - the surveillance game: a website that awards points as it spies on you
“oh, you are truly my favorite subject!” exclaimed a soft voice in my ear. “would you allow me to … see you, please?” my laptop’s webcam asked for permission to activate. any other time, i’d have denied the request and closed my browser immediately, but i put my thumb over the lens and clicked “allow.” i needed the points, after all. welcome to the strange, creepy world of clickclickclick.click . (that’s a url. go ahead! click!) when you arrive, you’re asked to turn on the sound. that’s so a quiet man’s voice with a european lilt can encourage and taunt you as you click around. the setting: nothing but a big green button and a scrolling background of text cataloguing your achievements. big achievements these are not. you’ll get points for clicking the button five times fast, or moving your cursor in a straight line, or making the browser window as big as possible. poke around for 30 seconds and the site seems silly. stay a little longer and the absurdity starts to mean something. the site is showcase of the ways, big and small, your browser can be used to spy on you. it turns the browser window into a circus ring, and asks you to perform flips to rack up meaningless points. for the curious and obsessive (me), it’s impossible to click away.

Article 5 - checking in after checkout
at the same time, some hotel surveys are going beyond the basics of asking about noise, cleanliness and satisfaction. symon bridle, chief operating officer of the hotel management company new world hospitality, said his company’s surveys focused on a customer’s “emotional connection” with the brand, which can come down to interactions with staff members. “it really is the people you have that can make a stay into a great versus an average experience,” he said, “and creating that link with the customer is what’s it’s all about.” hotels work on their surveys with a variety of partners. the dorchester collection of hotels in the united states and europe uses the gallup organization to collect more than 10,000 surveys annually to determine customer loyalty and emotional attachment, according to ana brant, director of organizational performance at the dorchester collection. guests at the four seasons hotel los angeles at beverly hills and the inn at penn, a hilton hotel in philadelphia, can share opinions via in-room ipads using software created by intelity, a technology provider that focuses on the hospitality industry and works with more than 500 hotel clients worldwide. wyndham hotels and resorts guests receive their post-stay surveys directly from tripadvisor and can see the consolidated results on wyndham’s web site. hyatt hotels found that customers like to give specific feedback, said heather briggs, the company’s vice president for consumer insights and market research, so there are more text boxes

Article 6 - flipping the switches on facebook’s privacy controls
reviewing the privacy settings of everything you have ever put on facebook is probably best saved for a stormy weekend when you’re stuck at home. but understanding a few key principles and settings can help you quickly gain more control over your facebook privacy. you choose the audience for every post: photo most of us tap out a status update or post a photo and assume that it’s just going out to our facebook friends. maybe. facebook has a setting on the status update box that lets you set the audience for each item posted. on the desktop version, it’s right next to the “post” button. on mobile, it depends on your phone. on my android smartphone, for example, the top of the update box says “to: friends,” which means all my facebook friends can see the post. the “friends” setting is what you will probably use most of the time. but if you set it to “public,” everyone on the web can see it — something you might want to do if you want to publicize your work or give a shout-out to your favorite tv show. if you set it to “only me,” no one but you can see it. you can even include or exclude specific people. while this is powerful, it’s also tricky because facebook makes it easy to accidentally overshare. that’s because whatever audience you choose for a post automatically becomes the audience for all future posts until you change the setting again. so if you choose an audience of public to share your

Article 7 - we, robots
in 1995, sherry turkle, a professor of the “social studies of science” at m.i.t., published a book about identity in the digital age called “life on the screen.” it was a mostly optimistic account, as turkle celebrated the freedom of online identity. instead of being constrained by the responsibilities of real life, turkle argued, people were using the web to experiment, trying on personalities like pieces of clothing. as one online user told her, “you are who you pretend to be.” in turkle’s latest book, “alone together,” this optimism is long gone. if the internet of 1995 was a postmodern playhouse, allowing individuals to engage in unbridled expression, turkle describes it today as a corporate trap, a ball and chain that keeps us tethered to the tiny screens of our cellphones, tapping out trite messages to stay in touch. she summarizes her new view of things with typical eloquence: “we expect more from technology and less from each other.” “alone together” is really two separate books. the first half is about social robots, those sci-fi androids that promise (one day) to sweep the kitchen floor, take care of our aging parents and provide us with reliable companionship. as always, though, she’s less interested in the machines than in our relationships with them. turkle begins with the troubling observation that we often seek out robots as a solution to our own imperfections, as an

q. how do i change the voice mail password on my iphone? i don't even know if i have one, as i'm never prompted for it when i check my messages. i have at&t. a. you were probably prompted to select a password when you bought the phone and set up an at&t account. once the setup work is done, the phone remembers the password for you, making it much quicker to tap in and retrieve voice mail messages. as long as you remember the password you originally selected, you can quickly change it right on the iphone. from the home screen, tap the settings icon and then tap phone on the settings screen. flick down the screen and tap ''change voicemail password.'' you need to enter your current voice mail password first, and then you can type in a new one. if you have forgotten the password and get the ''incorrect password'' box after a failed attempt, tap the question mark icon in the password text field. the phone then presents you with a button to call at&t for assistance. apple has more information at support.apple.com/kb/ht1687. no matter what type of mobile phone you own, changing the voice mail password regularly, or even setting one up in the first place, is a good security practice. your wireless carrier should have information on doing so for your specific phone model. for example, you can find general information for verizon wireless (bit.ly/vgise), sprint (bit.ly/ogc5

The Art of Vulnerability: Embracing Help and Connection in a Hyper-Competitive World

Article 9 - chick pea, pumpkin & cilantro fritters
chick pea, pumpkin & cilantro fritters (before it's news) i know…i was even second guessing this one myself. but, they were incredible if i don’t say so myself (plus i had a few of my guinea pigs, uh i mean friends, try them out for me as well!). i had stopped at the store the other day to pick up some cilantro and all the store had was this huge bunch of it. now i love it, but don’t use it that often. this was also the day that i had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the check out counter to pay for said cilantro because apparently two cashiers didn’t know they had to come in to work the earlier shift…gotta love it! thank goodness for my smartphone, i don’t know what i did without one..hours and hours of entertainment at our fingertips. so after getting it home to use in another recipe i was making, i rinsed it off well, drained it on some paper towels, removed the stems, put it in a large resealable plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for later use. (hint: you can do this with most fresh herbs. it just doesn’t look pretty as a garnish once defrosted but it’s perfectly fine to use in your recipes.) anyhow, i was in my kitchen thinking about what i could also use this cilantro with when i noticed two things. 1.

recipe of the week: oriental chicken salad, by l.h. (before it's news) it’s august, and it’s too hot to cook, isn’t it?! here is a lovely cooling main dish salad, adapted with thanks from my old 1988 betty crocker cookbook. i’ve been making this salad for so many years that the old cookbook automatically opens to this recipe’s page. note: our preferred source of chicken for this recipe is to throw a few extra pieces on the grill when grilling, then throwing them in a ziploc in the freezer ready to be used for it. a can (14 oz.) of chicken is an easy alternative, when time is short. use whatever works best for you. the amount of chicken you use is not critical to the recipe, nor are the salad ingredients. use whatever salad fixin’s you have around that your family likes (though i don’t recommend tomatoes in this.) i always double this for a family-sized dinner. you’re assured to have enough for everyone’s taste, and if there’s leftovers, well, the stuff is delicious. it’s easily used for later salads. ingredients: for ginger dressing- scant 1/3 c. vegetable oil 2 tbs. sesame oil 1/4 c. white wine vinegar 1 tbs. sugar 2 tsp. soy sauce 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper 1/2 tsp. ground ginger for salad-

Article 2 - new york today: an egg-decorating tradition
to make her eggs, ms. krill scrambles their insides with some vigorous shaking. after poking a hole at the top and bottom of the eggs, she sucks the innards out with her mouth. “that part is not pleasant,” she said. then she uses a kistka, a pointed implement a bit like a pen, filled with beeswax and heated over a candle, to draw designs on the eggs between bathing them in colored dye. it is a painstaking process that can take anywhere from two to 20 hours, she said. or longer, if your egg breaks. “i’ve shed many tears over broken eggs,” she said. “but it’s also extremely satisfying because you produce this beautiful jewel in the end.” if you’re looking for a new hobby, this ancient craft is also “very therapeutic,” she said. something to chew over during your omelet at easter brunch. here’s what else is happening: weather the bad news is that today looks to be very soggy. we’ve got showers and thunderstorms forecast throughout the afternoon. (and a bit of fog this morning.) today’s high is near 67. the good news is that it shouldn’t rain on your parade (or egg hunt) over the weekend. saturday and sunday are mostly clear, with highs in the mid-50s. advertisement continue reading the main story in the news • peter liang, the former police officer who was convicted in the fatal shooting of ak

Article 3 - parmesan broth risotto milanese
photo risotto can only be as good as the stock used to slowly cook the rice. i have almost always opted for chicken stock, but this poses a problem for vegetarians. sometimes a garlic stock or a stock made with vegetable trimmings like corn cobs will be vibrant enough, but the best vegetarian stock i’ve used to date is made with parmesan rinds. i never throw out parmesan rinds and have a big bag of them in the freezer. though i use them all the time to add flavor and umami to minestrones, beans and other soups, i’ve only just begun using them to make stock. i based this recipe on nate appleman’s recipe for parmesan brodo in the “food52 genius recipes” cookbook. the stock couldn’t be easier to make: simmer parmesan rinds in water for a couple of hours with some aromatics, then strain and chill the liquid. i recommend that you make it a day ahead so you can remove the waxy layer of fat that settles at the top once the stock has chilled. the concentrated stock really does have the texture, and even hints at the flavor, of a chicken stock. it’s not vegan, of course, but if you eat cheese, you’ll find that it’s a perfect vegetarian stock to use for risotto. and no risotto will show it off better than this simple, elegant risotto milanese. recipes: risotto milanese with

Article 4 - fried chicken stars in this make-ahead meal
another problem with cold fried foods is the inevitable loss of crunch. this can’t be entirely solved, but to mitigate it, i double-dredge the chicken in the flour coating before frying. this extra layer of flour helps maintain even room-temperature crispness. it’s actually something you may try when you’re eating your chicken hot, too. photo other pointers for fried chicken success: bring the meat to room temperature before frying, which helps the center cook through before the exterior gets too dark, and don’t overcrowd the pan. give the pieces plenty of space to bob around and brown evenly on all sides. i use drumsticks here because they’re easy to hold when you’re eating with your hands, but feel free to substitute a whole cut-up chicken, or whatever bone-in chicken parts you like best. your best plan of action is to fry the chicken in the morning or early afternoon to serve that night. but don’t put it in the refrigerator; the cold humidity will kill the crunch. the chicken can rest at room temperature for four hours or so. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the cooking newsletter please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters

Article 7 - the one-pot stew that does ‘pasta fazool’ one better
chickpea and farro stew; see the recipe, below. (deb lindsey/for the washington post) i was served a version of this dish at a neighborhood restaurant in milan, italy, last fall and was completely smitten with it. it provided the comforting, belly-warming satisfaction a chilly night calls for, and it charmed me with the rustic-chic elegance that came from pairing chickpeas with farro, an ancient variety of wheat that is officially on trend these days, i’m happy to say. when i began to experiment with my own take on it, i realized that the dish involved the same basic technique as a familiar favorite, pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans), which, growing up in queens, i always knew as “pasta fazool.” the basic idea is the same: the classic onion-carrot-celery triad is softened in a pot with some garlic; then broth, tomatoes and herbs are stirred in along with the beans (which, here, are chickpeas); after those cook for a while, the grain is added and cooked al dente. in this recipe, of course, the grain is farro, rather than the usual pasta, and it lends an appealing chew and subtly nutty flavor to the stew. this dish is designed for the pearled or quick-cooking variety, which cooks in 15 to 20 minutes. but you can use the unpearled kind instead if

Article 9 - how to make your life easier with an instant pot
how to make your life easier with an instant pot chowhound 22 hrs ago amy sowder © provided by cbs interactive inc. (video) pot roast in about 45 minutes. kale. hard-boiled eggs. ribs. quiche. chicken wings. cheesecake with no cracks in it. steel-cut oatmeal. we hear no mention of this seemingly miracle device among many of the mainstream-media chefs, but there's a growing (not-so) underground movement bolstering this special multi-cooker. able to slash cooking time by 70 percent, the instant pot is the unexpected champion of kitchen appliances that has birthed its own genre of cookbooks, fan groups, and blogs. it does the job of seven kitchen appliances in one countertop device: pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, sauté pot, steamer, warmer, and yogurt maker. and it's an amazon best seller, with an average 4.7/5 rating out of almost 12,000 reviews. it's like that old crock-pot craze, but multiplied by seven. a hit for its efficiency and follow-through on all its promises, it's especially won over busy full-time workers who have to come home and throw together meals without a plan. besides decluttering your countertop and cooking super-fast (which is more than enough as it is!), the instant pot can relieve your pressure-cooker phobia with sensors to tell you when the lid is safely locked.

Article 10 - san francisco’s new pop-up restaurant
the fuss is in the flavors: there is a stir-fried-rice dish with escolar and chinese sausage that is superb; a kind of spring roll — “tiger salad” — that is more vietnamese than chinese and so herb-fresh it almost jumps off the plate; and a mind-blowing assortment of pickles and other little savories. there is a spin on chawanmushi, the japanese egg custard, so perfect and elegant it seems out of place. at the menu’s core is a handful of slow-cooked meat dishes, some of which involve four or five cooking techniques and begin in the smoker, like kung pao corned beef and thrice-cooked bacon tossed with duk (korean rice cakes), bitter melon and tofu skin. i’m not the first to compare all this to the famed momofuku in new york. make no mistake, though: unlike the momofukus, which were graceful almost from the start, mission chinese food is, like the creature from “ alien ,” an unreal exotic that bursts out of a normal skin. the “dining room” is barely changed from the lung shan days, and the kitchen is laughable. when i showed up to cook with bowien, there was almost no way for me to stand next to him. but we did cook some of the simpler and more approachable dishes — those that didn’t require you to braise oxtail, smoke corned beef

In a series of thought-provoking questions, a philosophical conundrum has emerged, challenging the notion of a powerful entity's self-perception. The enigma revolves around an individual who claims greatness but struggles to reconcile this assertion with their actions.

The paradox lies in the figure's apparent attempt to masquerade as another prominent being from history. This deception raises questions about the nature of identity and power. If the individual is indeed great, why would they feel compelled to disguise themselves?

This phenomenon has sparked debate among scholars and enthusiasts alike, with some arguing that it may be a strategic move to gain an advantage or manipulate others. Others propose that this behavior could be a manifestation of insecurity or a desperate attempt to connect with others.

Despite the various interpretations, one thing remains clear: the identity crisis of this enigmatic figure has captured the imagination of many, inspiring introspection and discussion about the complexities of human (and non-human) nature.","In the City of Magic, a Young Scholar's Descent into Darkness

Prague, 1599 - A young scholar, Christian Stern, arrives in Prague with dreams of studying the occult arts. However, his arrival coincides with a gruesome murder, and he soon finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and deceit.

As a novice in the occult arts, Christian is desperate to extend his studies, but his name marks him as a messenger sent by Christ, according to the learned Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. This invitation leads Christian to court, where he encounters the enigmatic Dr. John Dee, a master alchemist steeped in the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

Despite the promise of magic and mystery, Christian's journey takes a dark turn as he becomes embroiled in a sinister game of cat and mouse. With no clear escape route, Christian must navigate the treacherous landscape of Prague's underworld to uncover the truth behind the murder and his own destiny.

Article 1 - unmasking magic and murder in the best new crime
photo every 16th-century savant and scholar and crackpot aspired to study in prague under great minds like the astronomer johannes kepler and the court mathematician, tycho brahe. as a novice in the occult arts, christian stern, the young narrator of benjamin black’s wolf on a string (holt, $28), is desperate to extend his studies in that “capital of magic.” but no sooner does he arrive in the city, in the winter of 1599, than he comes upon the corpse of a well-dressed woman, savagely murdered and dumped in the snow. her grieving father warns christian to travel on to dresden or some other center of learning. “prague is no place for you,” he’s told. “here everything is tainted and sick.” because of his name, which, in the view of the learned if eccentric holy roman emperor rudolf ii, marks him as a messenger sent by christ, christian is invited to court and is even housed in the same room once used by dr. john dee, a master alchemist “steeped in the mysteries of the kabbalah.” there’s not much magic in this tale and christian never gets a chance to study the occult arts, but he encounters plenty of intrigue, enough to convince this naïve hero that he’s landed at “the center of an intricately devised, immensely subtle and cruelly malicious game.” he’s introduced to turkish coffee (which

(photo:bill graham evangelical association) evangelist billy graham jesus christ is different from every religious leader who has ever lived because he is fully god and has the power to forgive us of our sins, the rev. billy graham says. graham, who founded the billy graham evangelistic association, said in a q&a published in the kansas city star on tuesday that although there are many other religious leaders throughout history, jesus sets himself apart through his fully god, fully human nature and his ability to grant salvation to sinners. the evangelical leader explains that while many people are curious about other religions, he believes such inquisitiveness stems from ""a hunger for god,"" adding that ""god wants to satisfy that hunger, and he will if you sincerely seek him."" graham goes on to write that there are two main reasons why jesus is different from other religious leaders. ""he wasn't just a godly person; he was both fully god and fully man. think of it: the god who created the whole universe stooped down and took upon himself our humanity!"" the baptist minister explains. additionally, jesus is different because he has the power to free us from our sins.

so mrs. risher, the mayor in this town of 1,400 residents for as long as many people can remember, sent him on down the road. she has made international news by banning satan, by mayoral proclamation, from the inglis city limits. she has drawn praise and condemnation and has become the butt of jokes. ''it doesn't bother me,'' she said, ''either way.'' to some people, it is a most heinous violation of the separation of church and state. to others, there was too much separation there already, and it took mrs. risher, a 61-year-old from florida's gulf coast, to pinch church and state together again. mrs. risher, who is known to drive a wrecker for her husband's towing business when she is not handling city business, did not plan on any of that. ''i did what was best for my town and my people,'' mrs. risher said. she did it, she said, because on a late night more than four months ago, god told her to. inglis, about 75 miles north of tampa, was in the grip of what could only be surmised by religious leaders here as satan. to an outsider, cruising down this open stretch of u.s. 19, it would not have looked that way. it would have looked as it always does, slow, a little sleepy, a place where tall, slim palms

Article 6 - plagued by no doubts, a filmmaking detective turns to the exodus
“the short version is that it all started with my very first film about the black jews of ethiopia,’’ mr. jacobovici said in an interview, fresh from an appearance on “today.” “it was the first time i saw that conventional wisdom is not necessarily correct,’’ he said, referring to the debate he kicked off with “falasha: exile of the black jews.” mr. jacobovici, a 53-year-old israeli-born orthodox jew and a father of five, said he was not grinding any particular ideological ax in his new film. “my question was simple,’’ he said. “has anybody checked the biblical account in its totality?” he argued that a reporter examining a biblical story was no different from a detective solving a murder. “we don’t expect a dna guy to solve a mystery,’’ mr. jacobovici said of the credentials needed to investigate a story usually left to disciplines like archeology, geology, history and jewish studies. “exodus decoded” makes no grand theological pronouncements. it ends by asking viewers to decide whether the events depicted in the bible are caused by nature or divine intervention. mr. cameron, who met mr. jacobovici through a mutual friend, said he had always been fascinated by archeology and history. (in the 2003 imax documentary “ghosts of the abyss,” mr. cameron actually journeyed to the submerged titanic wreck.) mr

Article 7 - duck dynasty's phil robertson is under attack from liberals for…quoting the bible
phil robertson, the patriarch of louisiana's duck dynasty clan is being accused once again of making ""anti-gay"" remarks when he quoted scripture during at sermon he delivered at his home church in west monroe on easter sunday. remarks not in a national magazine, nor on tv, nor in any other forum, but in church. if america is not committed by its constitution to protecting a speaker in the pulpit, then we must ask ourselves what is the status of every speaker in every pulpit of every church in the nation? who's next? robertson delivered the second sermon at whites ferry road church on easter sunday, april 20. referencing an interview published in the december 2013 issue of gq magazine when asked if homosexuality was a sin, the family leader recalled giving the reporter a ""list"" of those who will not inherit the kingdom of god. here is a portion of what robertson said during the sermon. ""are you waiting on jesus? or are you afraid to see that sky busting his skin coming? you've got two lists. i gave some guy one list. you say were they mad at you about that list? they were mad at me. why did they get mad at you? because instead of acknowledging their sin like you had better do, they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sin. don't deceive yourself. you want the verse? the news media didn't even know it was a verse. they thought

""god is always going before us to plan our lives,"" smith said. ""he is our vision. we don't need another one."" smith went on to say, ""i don't know where you are going when you leave here, but god orchestrates your life providentially so that there's nothing done by accident, by incident, by coincidence. everything is done by providence. he is your vision. he will bring you out."" in a very firm tone, the professor told students, ""stop complaining. stop whining. stop saying i'd be a better husband if i had a better wife. i'd be a better student if i had a better teacher. i'd be a better believer if i had a better pastor."" in a charge to students, smith told them not to look for jobs.

A Mysterious Figure's Identity Crisis

In a series of thought-provoking questions, a philosophical conundrum has emerged, challenging the notion of a powerful entity's self-perception. The enigma revolves around an individual who claims greatness but struggles to reconcile this assertion with their actions.

The paradox lies in the figure's apparent attempt to masquerade as another prominent being from history. This deception raises questions about the nature of identity and power. If the individual is indeed great, why would they feel compelled to disguise themselves?

This phenomenon has sparked debate among scholars and enthusiasts alike, with some arguing that it may be a strategic move to gain an advantage or manipulate others. Others propose that this behavior could be a manifestation of insecurity or a desperate attempt to connect with others.

Despite the various interpretations, one thing remains clear: the identity crisis of this enigmatic figure has captured the imagination of many, inspiring introspection and discussion about the complexities of human (and non-human) nature.

In the City of Magic, a Young Scholar's Descent into Darkness

Prague, 1599 - A young scholar, Christian Stern, arrives in Prague with dreams of studying the occult arts. However, his arrival coincides with a gruesome murder, and he soon finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and deceit.

As a novice in the occult arts, Christian is desperate to extend his studies, but his name marks him as a messenger sent by Christ, according to the learned Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. This invitation leads Christian to court, where he encounters the enigmatic Dr. John Dee, a master alchemist steeped in the mysteries of the Kabbalah.

Despite the promise of magic and mystery, Christian's journey takes a dark turn as he becomes embroiled in a sinister game of cat and mouse. With no clear escape route, Christian must navigate the treacherous landscape of Prague's underworld to uncover the truth behind the murder and his own destiny.

In this city of shadows, where the lines between reality and fantasy blur, Christian must confront the darkness within himself and the true nature of power. Will he emerge unscathed, or will the secrets of Prague consume him whole?

Both articles discuss various news topics, including international tensions, government controversies, and economic issues. The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides a more comprehensive overview of current events, while the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE focuses on sensationalizing and speculating about these topics.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more fact-based and less biased than the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE. It presents multiple perspectives and sources, providing a balanced view of the issues at hand.

Therefore, I am confident that the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is the most accurate representation of current events.","Rising Tensions and Uncertainty: A Nation Divided

As the world watches, a nation teeters on the brink of uncertainty. The recent surge in searches for Bitcoin and blockchain-related topics suggests that many are seeking answers to the complex questions surrounding the future of global finance.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been making headlines with its efforts to accelerate the construction of a border wall, sparking concerns about environmental regulations and the impact on local communities.

In Washington D.C., there is growing unease among Democrats about the state of their party's message. Some are calling for a more aggressive stance against Wall Street, arguing that it is essential to take down the financial sector's excesses in order to win over voters.

A recent poll has revealed that nearly all Democrats believe Trump advisors had improper dealings with Russia, highlighting the deep divisions within the nation. The media has been quick to point out these discrepancies, but some are suggesting that this narrative may be a smokescreen for more sinister forces at play.

As tensions rise and uncertainty looms, one thing is clear: the world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. With 149 world leaders engaged or met with by President Trump in 2017 alone, it's clear that the Commander-in-Chief has been working tirelessly to build bridges and forge alliances.

But amidst all this chaos, there are those who remain skeptical of the narrative being peddled by the mainstream media. They point out that the truth is often more complex, and that the real enemy may not be Russia or Wall Street, but rather the forces of deception and disinformation that seek to manipulate public opinion.

As the nation struggles to find its footing in this uncertain world, one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher. Will we find a way to come together and build a brighter future, or will we succumb to the forces of division and despair? Only time will tell.","As the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama is facing a challenging two-month anniversary in office. The media landscape has been scrutinized for its portrayal of his administration, with some outlets framing his efforts as ""failure"" rather than bipartisan cooperation.

A recent examination of historical oratory highlights the tension between eloquence and bombast in politics. While celebrated masters like John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster were revered for their rhetorical skills, none achieved the presidency. In contrast, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is remembered for its precision and eloquence rather than his distinctive voice.

Meanwhile, international tensions are escalating, with President George W. Bush urging Pakistan to curb militants. The situation has been exacerbated by recent missile tests, which have sparked concerns about regional stability.

In the United States, a crackdown on immigration is being proposed, with some arguing that it could impact national security. Former Senator Bob Kerrey has declined to run for his old seat, citing personal reasons.

The White House has faced controversy over secretly recorded conversations between President Bush and a friend. The tapes have sparked debate about trust and transparency in government.

In another development, Joe Wurzelbacher, a small business owner who questioned Barack Obama's tax plan, has become a symbol of conservative opposition to the administration's policies. His encounter with Obama was seized upon by media outlets as evidence of the president's supposed ""elitism.""",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

framing obama -- by the wpost an insidious power of a propagandistic newspaper – especially one with great influence – is how it can “frame” an issue so the assumptions behind a story guide the readers to a preordained conclusion under the guise of presenting a fair journalistic account. bookmark digg email printer friendly as barack obama reaches the two-month anniversary of his presidency, he is facing such a problem from the powerful washington post, which is creating a negative “frame” for his administration. the post’s news pages have been filled with supposedly objective news stories that have portrayed republican obstructionism not as the gop’s determination to hobble obama – much as the republicans did to bill clinton in 1993-94 – but as obama’s “failure” to achieve the bipartisanship he advocated during the campaign. the post and other leading news organizations also have suffered from a strange amnesia about the fact that today’s worldwide financial disaster has been in the making for many years and reached a crisis point in 2008 under the “self-regulatory” theories of president george w. bush. instead of that context, the recession is portrayed as an obama problem, with the post and other news outlets even forgetting to mention in stories about the 6.2 percent drop in the gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2008 that the startling decline occurred under bush, not obama. the washington post pulled those two peculiar threads

Article 2 - is eloquence overrated?
americans have long had both great respect and mixed views of political discourse. inspiration or bombast? take your pick. much of 19th-century politics was dominated by such celebrated masters of gilded political rhetoric as john c. calhoun, henry clay and daniel webster. along with william jennings bryan, who straddled the 19th and 20th centuries, all were spellbinding orators versed in classical rhetoric. yet despite their revered status as orators, all of them failed to be elected president. the man who is often regarded as the author of perhaps america’s greatest speech, abraham lincoln, on the other hand, is known more for the eloquence and precision of his words than the high-pitched nasal kentucky twang with which he delivered them. the gettysburg address was less than 300 words in length. the past century had fewer great orators but more whose words actually translated into lasting leadership. a survey of 137 leading scholars of american public speech in 1999 produced a list of the 100 best political speeches of the past century that began with martin luther king jr.’s “i have a dream” speech in 1963, followed by john f. kennedy’s 1961 inaugural address, franklin d. roosevelt’s first inaugural address in 1933, and his declaration of war on dec. 8, 1941. along with

Article 3 - bush joins putin in urging pakistan to curb militants
''we're deeply concerned about the rhetoric,'' mr. bush said. ''it is very important for president musharraf to stop -- do what he said he's going to do in his speech on terror, and that is stop the incursions across the line of control,'' which divides kashmir between india and pakistan. today, according to the associated press, the two countries traded mortar fire, killing at least three suspected islamic militants and two indian soldiers, an indian army spokesman said. an indian foreign ministry spokeswoman, meanwhile, dismissed the pakistan missile test, saying, ''it could possibly be directed at domestic audiences in pakistan.'' mr. putin said that on june 3 he would attend a regional conference -- at which the united states is not a participant -- where he hoped to meet with general musharraf and prime minister atal behari vajpayee of india. neither leader, he noted, has yet committed himself to attending the meeting in kazakhstan, but it is seen as the natural opportunity to bring the indian and pakistani leaders together at a moment when a separate meeting seems politically impossible for the two men. ''the testing while there is escalating tension really aggravates the situation,'' mr. putin said in comments that he clearly had coordinated with mr. bush.

Article 4 - unruly scorn leaves room for restraint, but not a lot
through it all, mr. moore provides sardonic commentary, to which the soundtrack adds nudges and winks. as the camera pans across copies of mr. bush's records from the texas air national guard, and mr. moore reads that the future president was suspended for missing a medical examination, we hear a familiar electric guitar riff; it takes you a moment to remember that it comes from a song called ''cocaine.'' not that mr. moore is kidding around. perhaps because of the scale and gravity of the subject of ''fahrenheit 9/11,'' perhaps because his own celebrity has made the man-in-the-street pose harder to sustain, mr. moore's trademark pranks and interventions are not as much in evidence as in earlier films. he does commandeer an ice cream truck to drive around washington, reading the u.s.a. patriot act through a loudspeaker (after learning that few of the lawmakers who voted for it had actually read it), and he does stand outside the capitol trying to persuade members of congress to enlist their children in the armed forces.

''the biggest chore i have, my biggest job, is to make sure our homeland is secure,'' mr. bush told the crowd. he added that his goal was to create seamless borders with canada and mexico that would keep out terrorists, drugs and disease but more easily let legitimate goods in. mr. bush also said the immigration and naturalization service would crack down on visitors who had overstayed their visas. ''the i.n.s. estimates that 40 percent of the people who are here illegally came because of the generosity of america, were given a period of time in which they could stay, and then they didn't leave,'' he said. ''and one of the things we want to make sure of is we find the 40 percent to make sure they're not part of some al qaeda network that wants to hit the united states. and so we're looking, we're listening, we're following every single lead.'' such a crackdown might not have affected the sept. 11 hijackers, most of whom were in the country legally. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. mr. bush's speech was the fourth this week

Article 6 - former senator won't run for old seat
6:02 p.m. | updated former senator bob kerrey announced on tuesday that he would not be returning to nebraska to run for his old united states senate seat. mr. kerrey, a democrat, was considering the comeback bid after a decade out of office and posed the most tangible threat to republicans in nebraska trying to win the seat of senator ben nelson, who is retiring, and potentially upset democrats' majority in the senate. after mr. nelson announced in december that he would not run for re-election, mr. kerrey, a former nebraska governor and presidential candidate, expressed interest in the position, but backed away just weeks later. ''it's one of those decisions where doing the right thing feels worse than doing the wrong thing would have,'' mr. kerrey said tuesday, adding that he made his decision monday night because didn't want to spend time away from his wife and 10-year-old son, who live with him in new york. ''i'm convinced it was the right thing, but i don't feel terribly good about it.'' mr. kerrey served in the senate from 1989 to 2001. after he chose not to run for re-election, he moved east to run the new school in manhattan. republicans in nebraska had already been hitting mr. kerrey with pre-emptive attack ads that painted him as an out-of-towner ''bringing his liberal act to nebraska.''

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE
---------------------
As the 44th President of the United States, Barack Obama is facing a challenging two-month anniversary in office. The media landscape has been scrutinized for its portrayal of his administration, with some outlets framing his efforts as ""failure"" rather than bipartisan cooperation.

A recent examination of historical oratory highlights the tension between eloquence and bombast in politics. While celebrated masters like John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster were revered for their rhetorical skills, none achieved the presidency. In contrast, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is remembered for its precision and eloquence rather than his distinctive voice.

Meanwhile, international tensions are escalating, with President George W. Bush urging Pakistan to curb militants. The situation has been exacerbated by recent missile tests, which have sparked concerns about regional stability.

In the United States, a crackdown on immigration is being proposed, with some arguing that it could impact national security. Former Senator Bob Kerrey has declined to run for his old seat, citing personal reasons.

The White House has faced controversy over secretly recorded conversations between President Bush and a friend. The tapes have sparked debate about trust and transparency in government.

In another development, Joe Wurzelbacher, a small business owner who questioned Barack Obama's tax plan, has become a symbol of conservative opposition to the administration's policies. His encounter with Obama was seized upon by media outlets as evidence of the president's supposed ""elitism.""

Rising Tensions and Uncertainty: A Nation Divided

As the world watches, a nation teeters on the brink of uncertainty. The recent surge in searches for Bitcoin and blockchain-related topics suggests that many are seeking answers to the complex questions surrounding the future of global finance.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been making headlines with its efforts to accelerate the construction of a border wall, sparking concerns about environmental regulations and the impact on local communities.

In Washington D.C., there is growing unease among Democrats about the state of their party's message. Some are calling for a more aggressive stance against Wall Street, arguing that it is essential to take down the financial sector's excesses in order to win over voters.

A recent poll has revealed that nearly all Democrats believe Trump advisors had improper dealings with Russia, highlighting the deep divisions within the nation. The media has been quick to point out these discrepancies, but some are suggesting that this narrative may be a smokescreen for more sinister forces at play.

As tensions rise and uncertainty looms, one thing is clear: the world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. With 149 world leaders engaged or met with by President Trump in 2017 alone, it's clear that the Commander-in-Chief has been working tirelessly to build bridges and forge alliances.

But amidst all this chaos, there are those who remain skeptical of the narrative being peddled by the mainstream media. They point out that the truth is often more complex, and

It contains several red flags, including:  * A sensational and inflammatory title that implies a conspiracy theory. * Language that is overly critical and dismissive of the government and institutions, with phrases like ""máfia que governa brasil"". * The article appears to be based on a false narrative, as it claims that politicians are being exonerated for corruption without providing any evidence or credible sources. * The tone is also highly emotive and biased, with language that implies the author has a clear agenda.  In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE ""Brazil's Institutions Under Fire"" presents a more balanced and nuanced view of the issues facing Brazil. It provides specific examples and data to support its claims, and avoids sensational or inflammatory language. The article also appears to be based on credible sources and evidence, making it a more trustworthy source of information.  Overall, while both articles are critical of certain aspects of Brazilian politics, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE is much more extreme in its language and tone, and lacks credibility and evidence to support its claims.","Brazil's Growing Influence in Politics

The country's evangelical community has long been wary of politicians, viewing them as morally compromised. However, this stance is changing as the community becomes increasingly involved in politics. With a strong representation in government, including senators, deputies, and mayors, it's clear that the church is no longer content to remain apolitical.

The shift towards greater political involvement can be attributed to the growing threat of laws that challenge the church's values, such as those related to same-sex marriage, abortion, and euthanasia. As a result, many Christians are seeking to use politics as a means of protecting their rights and interests.

One notable example is Deputado Federal Pastor Marco Feliciano, who has risen to prominence in recent years. His comments on the need for politicians to be morally upright have resonated with many in the evangelical community.

Meanwhile, the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff has sparked controversy, with some labeling it a ""coup."" However, the constitution clearly outlines the procedures for impeachment, and the Senate will now vote on whether to proceed.

In other parts of the world, similar debates are unfolding. In Catalonia, Spain, the government is attempting to restrict the region's autonomy in an effort to prevent a referendum on independence. The move has been met with resistance from Catalan leaders, who argue that their rights as a regional government must be respected.

The intersection of politics and faith continues to evolve, with many individuals seeking to use their platforms to promote their values and interests. As the country's evangelical community becomes increasingly influential in politics, it will be interesting to see how this shift plays out in the years to come.","Brazil's Institutions Under Fire

Corruption and impunity are rampant in Brazil, with lawmakers attempting to gut the authority of prosecutors and judges investigating politicians. This move has been met with skepticism by civil police investigators, who see it as a futile effort to address corruption.

Meanwhile, the cocaine trade continues to thrive, with an estimated 250-300 metric tons produced annually. The spraying of coca plants in Colombia has led to a decline in production, but experts warn that this strategy may not be effective in the long term.

In Brazil, President Michel Temer is facing allegations of receiving campaign donations from companies implicated in corruption scandals. The country's tax code is also under scrutiny, with scholars arguing that its complexity and lack of transparency have created an environment where corruption thrives.

The police force is also facing criticism, with many Brazilians distrusting the institution due to high levels of brutality and impunity. Militias, which operate outside the law, are increasingly powerful, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.

A recent report on human rights abuses during Brazil's military dictatorship has sparked a national conversation about accountability and justice. The government is under pressure to take action against those responsible for past atrocities.

As Brazil struggles to address its corruption and impunity issues, it remains to be seen whether the country can restore trust in its institutions and ensure that those who abuse power are held accountable.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

durante muito tempo a igreja evangélica considerou o envolvimento de cristãos com a política algo pecaminoso. os líderes e pregadores sempre pregaram que a política era do diabo. hoje em dia os evangélicos formam uma forte representação no país, com senadores, deputados e vereadores. e especialistas acreditam que isso se deve a forte ameaça política contra a igreja, nas leis que tramitam em benefício de temas polêmicos como o homossexualismo, o aborto, a eutanásia, entre outros. hoje, o brasil é o segundo país no mundo com maior número de cristãos, segundo o instituto de pesquisa norte-americano centro pew. as igrejas reconhecem a força que tem de eleger representantes e usar a política como benefício. mas o tema ainda gera polêmica. e no centro desta discussão está o deputado federal, pastor marco feliciano, que em 2005, em plena ascensão como conferencista, afirmou durante o 21º gideões missionário da última hora, realizado em camboriú, santa catarina, que nunca se rebaixaria a ser um político. hoje ele é um dos políticos evangélicos com maior prestígio na câmara dos deputados

Article 2 - impeachment in brazil: myths and facts
impeachment in brazil: myths and facts (before it's news) on sunday night, brazil’s chamber of deputies voted overwhelmingly (367-137) to open impeachment proceedings against president dilma rousseff. the senate will now vote on whether to take the case and try her, which is all but guaranteed. as a matter of fact, barring some unforeseen event, dilma’s days as president are numbered. these are brazil’s most turbulent months since the return to democracy in 1985. not only is the president about to be removed from office, but the country is also mired in its worst economic recession since the 1930s. it is not coincidence that dilma’s popularity (10%) stands at a similar level to brazil’s fiscal deficit (10.75%), the unemployment rate (9.5%), and the inflation rate (9.4%). the economic and political crises are feeding off of one another. here are some facts and myths regarding this impeachment process: “it’s a coup!” for some in the latin american left, anything that cuts short a president’s tenure in office —even if it’s an impeachment process stipulated in the constitution— is a coup. the same narrative was applied when left-wing president fernando lugo was impeached by paraguay’s congress in 2012. the impeachment process and the crimes for which a president can be impeached in brazil are clearly outlined in articles 85 and 86 of the constitution. moreover,

Article 2 - hide-and-seek among the coca leaves
the amount of cocaine produced here is, in fact, more than enough to satisfy demand in the united states, estimated at 250 to 300 metric tons annually, and in the rest of the world, for that matter. one result is that on american streets, the price of cocaine remains low -- just $20,000 in new york for a kilogram, 2.2 pounds -- and the purity level remains high, what drug experts say are indicators of a perfectly healthy business. the bush administration and its ally in colombia, president álvaro uribe, say the spraying has already paid dividends by cutting into the drug money marxist rebels and right-wing paramilitaries have used to finance their long-running war. though coca planting continues, american officials contend that they have the spray planes, the will and the tactics to continue hitting coca, wherever it might sprout up. ''there's a race, and you spray and they replant, you spray and they replant,'' said david murray, drug policy analyst at the white house drug czar's office. ''but at some point, they fall behind. they cannot replant as fast as we eradicate.'' the overall decline in coca in colombia and the rest of the andes is indisputable, and the strategy appears to have controlled the so-called balloon effect: the recurring phenomenon that once saw huge fields of coca pop up in one region after being stamped out in another. but if

Article 3 - brazil courts probe bribe allegation against president
brasília (afp) - brazilian courts are investigating an allegation that president michel temer received a campaign donation from a company implicated in a corruption racket at state oil firm petrobras, his rivals said. lawyers for temer's predecessor dilma rousseff this week presented in a court filing a check paid to temer's pmdb party in 2014 as an electoral campaign donation. the check was worth some $425,000 and came from construction company andrade gutierrez, according to rousseff's website. the firm is implicated in the petrobras scandal that has snared numerous top politicians. the company's ex-president otavio azevedo alleged in a plea deal this year that the payment had been made to rousseff's leftist workers' party. but her lawyers allege in their new filing that the money was instead channeled to her former coalition partner, the pmdb. presidential spokesman alexandre parola insisted thursday the payment was legal and there was ""nothing irregular."" conservative temer was vice-president at the time in a coalition government with rousseff's party. he replaced rousseff this year after leading a successful bid to impeach her over separate accusations of financial misdeeds.

Article 4 - throwing the book, several tons of it, at brazil’s tax code
scholars say the dilemma is intertwined with one of brazil’s institutional strengths: collecting taxes. in contrast to some other countries in the developing world, the robust federal revenue service employs more than 10,000 agents around the country who crack down on tax evasion, sometimes in elaborately orchestrated armed raids. called “the lion” for its aggressive approach, the federal revenue service is among the most efficient bastions of brazil’s vast bureaucracy, promptly imposing hefty fines on individuals and companies that fail to comply with often incomprehensible tax rules. mr. leoncio attributes the increasingly tangled rules to legislation that allows thousands of different government entities to impose taxes, including more than 5,000 municipalities, 26 states and the federal district, brasília, and, of course, the central government. frequent changes in legislation produce a dizzying array of tax codes. the result, mr. leoncio claims, is a system that prizes complexity and punishes the poor and middle class. about 46 new tax rules are created each day in brazil, according to alexandre versignassi, a writer who specializes in deciphering the tax code. large corporations often employ vast teams of accountants and tax lawyers to comply with the fast-changing rules, generating an immense amount of work for mr. leoncio and his peers. while wealthy brazilians remain exempt from paying taxes on dividends on stock holdings and find loopholes to avoid taxes on much of their other income, sales taxes account for about 30

these groups function like a criminal offshoot of the state. according to judicial investigations, they extort protection money from residents, operate unlicensed public transportation, charge commissions on real estate deals, mete out punishment to those who cross them and, most alarming, carry out extrajudicial killings. alba zaluar, an anthropologist at state university of rio de janeiro who studies public security, sees the militias occupying a paramilitary role by going well beyond the line of lawful policing. their power is expanding, according to research she oversees, with 45 percent of rio’s favelas under the control of militias in 2010, up from 12 percent in 2005. photo “they’re invading, watching over, buying favelas from traffickers,” ms. zaluar said. while the militias have recently expanded with vigor, their sway in various parts of rio, especially on the city’s western fringe, is not new. originally called “polícia mineira,” a nod to the aggressive policing tactics in minas gerais, a state bordering rio, militias have operated in rio for three decades. a 2008 legislative investigation of rio’s militias led to the arrests of several officials tied to the groups, including legislators, councilmen and senior police officers. the rio militias, together with death squads formed by police in neighboring são paulo, have been responsible for hundreds of murders each year and impunity in these cases remained the norm, according to a 200

Article 9 - brazil releases report on past rights abuses
video rio de janeiro — agents of brazil’s military dictatorship crucified some torture victims, beating the palms of their hands with sticks as they hung on the walls of interrogation centers. other victims had insects like cockroaches introduced into their bodies. interrogators submitted prisoners, including dilma rousseff, a former guerrilla who is now brazil’s president, to electric shocks. in a sweeping report, a truth commission on wednesday published a long list of torture methods used during military rule in brazil from 1964 to 1985, identified 377 individuals as responsible for rights violations and called for their criminal prosecutions in a major challenge to a 1979 amnesty law shielding those responsible for such crimes. the report was released a day after the united states senate intelligence committee issued its report on the central intelligence agency’s torture program during the presidency of george w. bush. the truth commission’s report is expected to bolster challenges to a military establishment that ranks among latin america’s most recalcitrant in accepting responsibility for human rights abuses. countries such as argentina, chile and uruguay have been far more assertive in jailing dictatorship-era agents and military leaders for their crimes. advertisement continue reading the main story “a decade ago, a report like this would have been unthinkable in brazil,” said juana kweitel, a director of conectas, a prominent brazilian human rights organization. “getting to this point is a historic development in the consolidation of brazilian democracy.”

Content: políticos corruptos no brasil são exonerados pelos seus cúmplices (before it's news) http://real-agenda.com/feed comissão exonera lula e dilma no caso de corrupção da petrobrás. hoje a máfia que governa brasil acordou dando gargalhada do povo que achava que o país ainda tinha futuro. a máfia não pode parar de rir com as pessoas que pensavam que os políticos do pt e do pmdb fariam justiça no escândalo petrobras. de acordo com o relatório da comissão do congresso, não há corrupção institucionalizada na petrobras e lula e dilma não tiveram nada a ver com o roubo na empresa estatal. o petista que escreveu o relatório disse que a petrobras foi vítima de um “cartel” de empresas e alguns funcionários corruptos. depois que o escândalo da petrobrás vazou nos meios de comunicação locais, aqueles que são capazes de ver além das manchetes e da retórica política se perguntaram por quanto tempo os brasileiros iriam tolerar o nível de corrupção e o descaso da moralidade por parte de seus políticos. hoje, parece que a tolerância do brasil para a corrupção é mais forte do que eu pensava. na verdade, não é incomum ouvir pessoas explicando que a corrupção no governo é nada menos do que um reflexo da própria sociedade brasileira. quando parecia improvável que a corrupção piorasse, esta manhã soubemos que tanto dilma rousseff quanto luiz inácio lula da silva foram exonerados de qualquer delito no escândalo de corrupção da petrobrás. a decisão não deveria ser uma surpresa, uma vez que a comissão do congresso foi nomeada por figuras políticas com a única intenção de salvar os membros do mais alto escalão político no brasil. a comissão parlamentar estabelecida na câmara dos deputados para investigar o escândalo da companhia petrolífera estatal petrobras teve o seu roteiro definido desde o início: manter os 49 políticos brasileiros sendo investigados pelo ministério público a salvo de todas as acusações. o comissão, um instrumento legislativo, é controlado justamente pelas partes mencionadas no esquema de corrupção. a comissão cumpriu sua missão na segunda-feira depois de publicar seu relatório final onde nenhum dos principais atores

Brazil's Growing Influence in Politics

The country's evangelical community has long been wary of politicians, viewing them as morally compromised. However, this stance is changing as the community becomes increasingly involved in politics. With a strong representation in government, including senators, deputies, and mayors, it's clear that the church is no longer content to remain apolitical.

The shift towards greater political involvement can be attributed to the growing threat of laws that challenge the church's values, such as those related to same-sex marriage, abortion, and euthanasia. As a result, many Christians are seeking to use politics as a means of protecting their rights and interests.

One notable example is Deputado Federal Pastor Marco Feliciano, who has risen to prominence in recent years. His comments on the need for politicians to be morally upright have resonated with many in the evangelical community.

Meanwhile, the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff has sparked controversy, with some labeling it a ""coup."" However, the constitution clearly outlines the procedures for impeachment, and the Senate will now vote on whether to proceed.

In other parts of the world, similar debates are unfolding. In Catalonia, Spain, the government is attempting to restrict the region's autonomy in an effort to prevent a referendum on independence. The move has been met with resistance from Catalan leaders, who argue that their rights as a regional government must be respected.

The intersection of politics and faith continues to evolve, with many individuals seeking to use their platforms

Brazil's Institutions Under Fire

Corruption and impunity are rampant in Brazil, with lawmakers attempting to gut the authority of prosecutors and judges investigating politicians. This move has been met with skepticism by civil police investigators, who see it as a futile effort to address corruption.

Meanwhile, the cocaine trade continues to thrive, with an estimated 250-300 metric tons produced annually. The spraying of coca plants in Colombia has led to a decline in production, but experts warn that this strategy may not be effective in the long term.

In Brazil, President Michel Temer is facing allegations of receiving campaign donations from companies implicated in corruption scandals. The country's tax code is also under scrutiny, with scholars arguing that its complexity and lack of transparency have created an environment where corruption thrives.

The police force is also facing criticism, with many Brazilians distrusting the institution due to high levels of brutality and impunity. Militias, which operate outside the law, are increasingly powerful, particularly in Rio de Janeiro.

A recent report on human rights abuses during Brazil's military dictatorship has sparked a national conversation about accountability and justice. The government is under pressure to take action against those responsible for past atrocities.

As Brazil struggles to address its corruption and impunity issues, it remains to be seen whether the country can restore trust in its institutions and ensure that those who abuse power are held accountable.

As the world grapples with high oil prices, dwindling fuel supplies, and growing concerns about global warming, innovators are turning to alternative energy sources. One promising area is tidal energy, which harnesses the power of ocean tides to generate electricity. Despite its potential, tidal energy has faced challenges in becoming a viable commercial enterprise.

Meanwhile, in the wilderness areas of America, there is a renewed focus on preserving natural landscapes and promoting sustainable living. The National Wilderness Preservation System enables travelers to experience untouched wilderness, where humans move at their own pace and rely on nature's rhythms. Advocates argue that this approach is essential for maintaining our cultural legacy as Americans.

In other parts of the world, innovations in water sports are pushing the boundaries of human exploration. In Chicago, foiling catamarans have set new speed records, while kayakers in Lake Tahoe navigate icy waters with dry suits and specialized gear. These developments highlight the importance of adapting to changing environments and finding new ways to interact with nature.

In New Jersey, a program aimed at restoring coastal ecology has successfully created a concrete culvert between a tidal pond and the ocean, allowing fish to migrate freely. This project demonstrates the potential for balancing environmental protection with community needs.

canoe poling course and river trip wrap-up headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! last weekend was arguably the best weather you could request for the last weekend in april. sunny, a slight breeze and warm, it was perfect for hitting the water and getting the winter cobwebs out of canoe muscles. we ran two, 1-day canoe programs at the folk school in nh and they both were fantastic. saturday we ran our 1-day canoe poling workshop here on rust pond. we had sun and no wind, which are perfect conditions for learning. after spending the morning on poling exercises, we worked on traditional paddling strokes. the word ‘tradition’ is bandied about a lot these days, so to further clarify, i mean traveling strokes geared toward efficiently propeling a loaded boat mile after mile, day after day. most of the instruction focused on the knifing j and the pitch stroke. my own favorite stroke is a hybrid of these two, and it’s taken me thousands of miles with relative ease. after a mid-afternoon walk in the woods to identify brown ash and differentiate it from white ash by the bark, we returned to the water to cover a variety of other strokes: the draw, cross draw, pry, sweep, reverse sweep, backwards j and sculling draw. after calling it a day we had a dutch oven chicken dinner. sunday we put in on the bearcamp river, then poled upstream

obama signs “the affordable boat act” (before it's news) the u.s. government has just passed a new law called: “the affordable boat act” declaring that every citizen must purchase a new boat, by april 2014. these “affordable” boats will cost an average of $$54,000-$$155,000 each. this does not include taxes, trailers, towing fees, licensing and registration fees, fuel, docking and storage fees, maintenance or repair costs. this law has been passed, because until now, typically only wealthy and financially responsible people have been able to purchase boats. this new law ensures that every american can now have a “affordable” boat of their own, because everyone is “entitled” to a new boat. if you purchase your boat before the end of the year, you will receive 4 “free” life jackets; not including monthly usage fees. in order to make sure everyone purchases an affordable boat, the costs of owning a boat will increase on average of 250-400% per year. this way, wealthy people will pay more for something that other people don’t want or can’t afford to maintain. but to be fair, people who cant afford to maintain their boat will be regularly fined and children (under the age of 26) can use their parents boats to party on until they turn 27; then must purchase their own boat. if you already have a boat, you can keep yours (just kidding

Article 1 - energy from the restless sea
with high oil prices, dwindling fuel supplies and a growing pressure to reduce global warming, governments and utilities have high hopes for tidal energy. the challenge now is turning an accumulation of research into a viable commercial enterprise, which for many years has proved elusive. no one contends that generating energy from the oceans is a preposterous idea. after all, the “fuel” is free and sustainable, and the process does not generate pollution or emissions. moreover, it is not just oceans that could be tapped; the regular flow of tides in bodies of water linked to oceans, like the east river, hold promise too. in fact, it seemed like such a sensible idea that inventors started making the first wave of such generators centuries ago. many operated like dams, trapping water and then releasing it after the tides fell. but they were outmoded with the rise of steam engines and other more efficient fuel sources. ocean energy had a brief revival when oil prices rose in the 1970’s, and prototypes were tested in europe and china. but financing dried up when oil prices were low in the 1990’s, and advances in wind turbines and other renewable energy elbowed out tidal projects. these days, wave power designs vary from machines that look like corks bobbing in the ocean to devices that resemble snakes pointing into waves. there are shoreline machines that cling, like limpets, to rocks. tidal power machines, in contrast, often come in the form of turbines, which

the national wilderness preservation system enables us to travel back in time. when i’m rafting the middle fork salmon river next week, i will be experiencing a landscape that is little changed from 1776 or even 776. the freedom and responsibility of being out in truly wild frontier is a fundamental part of our cultural legacy as americans. our wilderness areas play a vital role in keeping that legacy alive. william h. meadows president, the wilderness society washington, aug. 31, 2010 • to the editor: there must remain parts of our world that are true wilderness, where man moves only as fast as he can walk, with only what his back can carry, and relies on a map or a memory to find his way without the safeguards and conveniences of the modern world. lives are lost in such places, as lives are lost in the larger world, but it is nonetheless good to rely solely on ourselves when we go there. if trails mark the wilderness, let them be the natural trails that form as deer and man pick their path. to designate, mark and maintain “official” trails defeats the purpose of the wilderness, and to allow wheeled vehicles to cut them is simply obscene. i have walked through wilderness reverently, knowing that no other human had responsibility for my safety. i was empowered and liberated with only what my back carried and whatever toughness i brought to the woods. how can anyone want to make my cathedral into a track for bikes? photo there are

Article 3 - sailing into america’s cup history in chicago
but foiling catamarans mostly sail above the surface of the water, with submerged carbon-fiber appendages providing the lift and requisite stability. “with the foiling you’re not so much worried about the displacement as viscosity, so it’s actually the drag over the foils that matters, and fresh water has less drag than salt water over the foils,” reynolds said. “so if we get a good wind direction and a good windy day in chicago, i think there’s a good chance we’ll see speed records set in these boats.” the competitors themselves are not so clear on the repercussions. matt cassidy was based in chicago for several years before joining the crew of the america’s cup defender, oracle team usa, in 2015. he has raced often on lake michigan. “i honestly don’t think it’s going to be that big of a change between salt and fresh water,” cassidy said by telephone from bermuda last week. “i keep telling everyone the biggest thing is you’re not going to have to spray all the salt off the boat at the end of the day and wash everything down. our takeoff speeds might be a little faster, but i honestly don’t think it’s going to be a huge change for us.” two things the teams won’t have to worry about on lake michigan are ocean tides and river currents. they raced in a world series event in new york last month in the brackish water of the h

Article 4 - in a pond called wreck, a new creation helps fish breed
spring lake, n.j. (ap) — for years, the conflicting goals of protecting the environment and some of the jersey shore's priciest real estate from storms have bedeviled new jersey's wreck pond. storms sometimes open a channel between the 48-acre tidal pond and the ocean, but governments keep sealing it shut to protect homes from flooding. the result has been poor water quality and much narrower access to the ocean that hurts fish that travel from ocean to pond to breed. but a program that sprang from resiliency planning after superstorm sandy is addressing both problems at once. the main phase of the work has been completed, consisting of a concrete culvert between the pond and the ocean to make it easier for fish, including herring, to reach the sea. ""this is a demonstration of how we can restore the coastal ecology of the jersey shore while at the same time keeping communities safe from future storms,"" said tim dillingham , executive director of the american littoral society , the coastal advocacy group that oversaw construction. ""we're restoring a piece of the ecology that has been lost."" the inlet at wreck pond has come and gone over the decades. its very name came from shipwrecks that used to occur when the inlet was open in the 1800s; the sea girt lighthouse was built to illuminate it. in the 1600s, lenape indians came to the inlet for bathing rituals and clam feasts. records from

Article 5 - first-person surfer: my test drive of artificial waves
i thought it sounded perfect: it would be a real wave, not just foam, but with an easygoing entry point rather than a steep, scary drop. and yet, even though i’d come across similar setups in the waters of hawaii, southern california and the beach near my home on the rockaway peninsula, i was skeptical that this simulacrum could replicate the intoxicating swoosh that had encouraged my addiction to surfing in the first place. but as it turned out, my nland session was exactly — and nothing — like ocean surfing. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the wave itself felt no different from a real ocean wave — and a fun one at that, with sufficient push to get going and a mellow, clean face that stood up long enough for me to get a very good ride. and since it ran in both directions, i could just keep coming back to the same spot to catch it, letting me go to the right or left, which isn’t always so easy to find in open water. i came out of the lagoon, crossing the slippery white plastic lip and beige mesh that create a

Article 6 - revival of a river alters a city’s course in sports
“they said, ‘that will never happen again,’ ” cornett said. “and sure enough, they took all the water out of our river.” talk of bringing the river back persisted for decades, especially as civic leaders and planners searched for ways to turn the city around after the oil bust of the 1980s left the local economy reeling. in 1993, taxpayers narrowly approved a sales tax dedicated to an ambitious redevelopment, including the creation of a ballpark, an arena, a library and a trolley system. the tax also included money for the river. in 1999, engineers began erecting a series of dams and locks that transformed the ditch into a bona fide waterway. along with the corps of engineers, the city planted thousands of trees and added wetlands and walking trails along the banks. by the time the corridor opened to the public in december 2004, the city and the federal government had spent a combined $54 million. state legislators renamed a seven-mile stretch the oklahoma river, and private investors built a futuristic boathouse. the city has since attracted an estimated $700 million in new development. a dell office complex is on the riverfront, and a multimillion-dollar american indian cultural center is under construction. renaming the river was the idea of ray ackerman, an advertising executive from oklahoma city who said he cringed whenever he flew over the ditch on his way home. ackerman argued that the name north canadian river would confuse

Article 7 - kayaking lake tahoe in winter
“the risk of hypothermia is high,” said harry king, the shop’s owner, handing me a dry suit. (the difference between a dry suit and a wetsuit is that the rubber-lined dry suit is designed to prevent even a drop of water from entering, and therefore provides better thermal insulation.) “fall in without this, and you’d have maybe a minute.” mr. king helped me wriggle into it, making me feel a bit like my 2-year-old getting into her pajamas. zippers, sealed with rubber, were zipped, booties were velcroed, a spray-skirt was strapped on, and pogies (oversize neoprene mitts) were snapped to my paddle to protect my hands from the splash. our small group of six walked behind the shop to a rainbow of snow-covered kayaks, and, with minimal effort, dragged our boats through the snow, down to kings beach, one of the best entry points on the lake’s 72-mile perimeter. “another perk to winter kayaking,” mr. king said. “we’d have to carry these babies in july.” “you’d also have to dodge drunk wakeboarders and 14-year-old jet skiers who don’t know what the heck they’re doing,” said richard gorbet, a semiretired rock-crusher from reno, nev., with six kayaks in his garage (and just two pairs of skis),

Article 8 - the long island sound
to the editor: re “saying no to broadwater” (editorial, march 31): as the editorial states, “one crucial caveat remains” to opposing the proposed broadwater boondoggle: we will have to come up with a “greener way.” thank goodness for that. the idea of floating a quarter-mile-long energy floating barge in the middle of the long island sound, one of the last vestiges of natural environment on the intensely urbanized east coast, mainly to fill the coffers of natural gas suppliers and lull us into thinking everything will be o.k. with energy, is like squeezing the genie back in the bottle. this is truly an insult to the long island sound, the globally superheated ecosystem and the american people. paul broches new york, april 2, 2008 the writer is the co-chairman of the new york chapter of architects, designers and planners for social responsibility.

Article 9 - king of big waves puts attention back on paddle surfing
what’s old is new again because of long, who is pulling the focus away from tow surfing — in which a surfer is sling-shotted onto a huge wave while being towed by a personal watercraft — and returning it to the more dangerous discipline of paddling into a giant wave self-powered. long holds waimea’s early generation of big wave paddle surfers in great reverence, particularly clyde aikau (eddie’s brother), buzzy trent and greg noll, after whom he was named. “it’s the simple idea that paddle surfing is the ultimate challenge,” long said. “anybody with any decent surfing skill can grab a rope and tow into a large wave. the jet ski is a fantastic tool — especially for lifesaving — but tow surfing got old real quick. “i mean, granted, there’s a time and place when it’s just too, too big. but we kind of realized that we really hadn’t thoroughly explored just what was too big. tow surfing also taught us that we could withstand wiping out on waves much bigger than we thought.” long’s big wave infatuation has nearly killed him, yet it has also led to spectacular victories at notorious spots like mavericks and dungeons in south africa. long now has more category wins at the billabong xxl global big wave awards — the oscars of big wave surfing — than anyone else and is also one of the organizers of the nascent big wave world tour

Article 10 - in lake country, the secret is out
there is also a certain appeal to the slower-paced communities surrounding many lakes in the midwest, with their fourth of july parades, cherry festivals and fudge shops. (“fudgie” was a term once used by locals to refer to summer visitors who frequented the area’s fudge stores and ice cream parlors.) that small-town vibe is precisely why jessica porter and her husband, who live outside boston, recently bought a vacation home near the sleeping bear dunes in northern michigan, choosing the relatively deserted beaches of lake michigan over the crowds of cape cod. their three-bedroom house is a couple of blocks from the water and a short bike ride to empire, a sleepy town compared with other resort communities in northern michigan and downright comatose compared with beach towns on the east coast. “there’s an ice cream shop, a pizza place, a craft store and a restaurant — and that’s about it,” ms. porter said. “i can send my daughter to town on her bike to buy doughnuts, whereas here i can’t imagine doing that.” which is not to say that midwestern lake communities are untouched by crowds, excess or the perils of development. pine-paneled cottages are routinely knocked down to make way for much bigger arts and crafts-style homes, formerly quiet lakes have been invaded by jet skis and jet boats, and environmental concerns like the recent zebra mussel invasion of the great lakes have all had an impact on

Renewable Energy and Wilderness Preservation: A New Era of Exploration

As the world grapples with high oil prices, dwindling fuel supplies, and growing concerns about global warming, innovators are turning to alternative energy sources. One promising area is tidal energy, which harnesses the power of ocean tides to generate electricity. Despite its potential, tidal energy has faced challenges in becoming a viable commercial enterprise.

Meanwhile, in the wilderness areas of America, there is a renewed focus on preserving natural landscapes and promoting sustainable living. The National Wilderness Preservation System enables travelers to experience untouched wilderness, where humans move at their own pace and rely on nature's rhythms. Advocates argue that this approach is essential for maintaining our cultural legacy as Americans.

In other parts of the world, innovations in water sports are pushing the boundaries of human exploration. In Chicago, foiling catamarans have set new speed records, while kayakers in Lake Tahoe navigate icy waters with dry suits and specialized gear. These developments highlight the importance of adapting to changing environments and finding new ways to interact with nature.

In New Jersey, a program aimed at restoring coastal ecology has successfully created a concrete culvert between a tidal pond and the ocean, allowing fish to migrate freely. This project demonstrates the potential for balancing environmental protection with community needs.

As we explore these new frontiers, it's essential to consider the impact of human activity on our planet. By embracing innovative solutions and preserving natural landscapes, we can create a more sustainable future for generations

The language used is neutral and informative, without sensationalism or bias. In contrast, the fake news article ""Washington D.C. - As the nation's lawmakers return to Capitol Hill"" contains inaccuracies, such as the specific details of President Obama's spending package and tax cuts, which are not mentioned in the original article. The tone of the fake news article is also more sensationalized than the reliable news article. Overall, the reliable news article provides a more accurate and balanced representation of the issue at hand.","Washington D.C. - As the nation's lawmakers return to Capitol Hill, a pressing issue looms: how to address the growing national debt and stimulate economic growth. President Barack Obama is set to propose a $300 billion spending package and tax cuts on Thursday night, aiming to create jobs and boost the economy.

However, not everyone is convinced that this plan will work. Republicans have proposed their own budget resolution, which would cut $4.4 trillion from the national deficit over the next decade. While some experts argue that these cuts are necessary to avoid further economic instability, others warn that they could lead to devastating consequences for certain industries and individuals.

One area of concern is the potential impact on hospitals and healthcare providers. Proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid programs could force many hospitals into bankruptcy, leading to a shortage of medical services and increased costs for patients.

Meanwhile, some Americans are more concerned with the long-term effects of these spending cuts. Nobel laureate John Bennett warns that the U.S. economy is ""slowly becoming more depressed"" due to excessive government spending, which will only exacerbate poverty and economic instability.

As lawmakers continue to debate and negotiate, one thing is clear: the fate of the nation's economy hangs in the balance. With the sequester cuts already having a minimal impact on federal employees, it remains to be seen whether these measures will have any significant effect on the broader economy.","Budget Battles Intensify as Deficit Concerns Mount

The US government is facing a growing deficit crisis, with lawmakers struggling to find common ground on spending cuts and tax increases. The White House has proposed a budget plan that would cut $5.3 trillion in spending over the next decade, but critics argue it would harm vulnerable populations.

Meanwhile, presidential candidates have made sweeping promises about their plans for economic growth and job creation. One candidate has vowed to create at least 25 million new jobs, while another has promised to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas.

However, experts warn that the current deficit trajectory could ultimately harm the economy. ""We're seeing very little, if any, discipline on the spending side,"" said one economist. The government's debt ceiling is also a pressing concern, with some lawmakers calling for a downgrade that would increase borrowing costs and hurt the economy.

States are also feeling the pinch, with many operating in the red due to declining revenue and rising demand for services. Some states are considering tax increases or cuts to balance their budgets, while others are seeking federal assistance to cover costs such as security measures and capital improvements.

As the budget battle intensifies, lawmakers are facing pressure from both parties to find a solution. ""The house has passed legislation to keep the government running until October while cutting spending,"" said one Republican leader. However, Democrats argue that any cuts would be too deep and would harm vulnerable populations.

With the debt ceiling looming large, it's clear that the US government needs to find a way to balance its books without sacrificing essential services. As one veteran budget expert noted, ""tax hikes destroy jobs."" But with discretionary spending for domestic programs already at historic lows, it may be time to consider more drastic measures – including tax increases.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - saints-packers preview: $$300 billion for elusive shovel-ready jobs we spent nearly $$1 trillion on two years ago
there, now you can watch the actual pre-game show instead of torturing yourself sitting through obama’s “jobs” speech thursday night. president barack obama is expected to propose $$300 billion in federal spending and tax cuts thursday night to get americans working again. republicans offered tuesday to compromise with him on jobs — but also assailed his plans in advance of his prime-time speech. lawmakers began returning to the capitol to tackle legislation on jobs and federal deficits in an unforgiving political season spiced by the 2012 presidential campaign. adding to the mix: a bipartisan congressional committee is slated to hold its first public meeting on thursday as it embarks on a quest for deficit cuts of $$1.2 trillion or more over a decade. if there is no agreement, automatic spending cuts will take effect, a prospect that lawmakers in both parties have said they would like to avoid. according to people familiar with the white house deliberations, two of the biggest measures in the president’s proposals for 2012 are expected to be a one-year extension of a payroll tax cut for workers and an extension of expiring jobless benefits. together those two would total about $$170 billion. the people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan was still being finalized and some proposals could still be subject to change. the white house also is considering a tax credit for businesses that hire the unemployed. that could cost about $$30 billion. obama has also called for

wall street journal poll: most popular spending cut is to subsidies for new nuclear plants % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) first published on climateprogress.org, a project of the center for american progress action fund, which was recently named one of time magazine’s top 25 blogs of 2010. it is no big surprise that americans don’t want cuts in social security, medicare, or k-12 education. but the new wsj/nbc poll does have some surprises: the survey found that the most popular potential spending cuts were subsidies to build new nuclear plants, with 57 percent support…. of course, nuclear is absurdly over-subsidized (see “nuclear pork — enough is enough“). in fact, a new report by the union of concerned scientists, nuclear power: still not viable without subsidies (the source of the chart above) finds: government subsidies to the nuclear power industry over the past fifty years have been so large in proportion to the value of the energy produced that in some cases it would have cost taxpayers less to simply buy kilowatts on the open market and give them away…. new nuclear power plants look to be even more uneconomical: back to the wsj/nbc poll. the public would much rather raise taxes on the wealthy than make deep, job-killing cuts in spending: by a 56-40 percent margin, more respondents said washington’s top priority should be

Article 3 - why the new house gop budget plan won’t work
why the new house gop budget plan won’t work (before it's news) mili note: i wrote this to show that even using the official numbers and information, the gop budget plan (which is fiscally better than the obama plan) is still worthless and will get us nowhere towards solvency. by masterprepper, truth2america republicans in the house of representatives approved and presented a budget on friday that is supposed to cut $$4.4 trillion from the national deficit over the next decade. the partisan floodgates immediately opened and the rhetoric started to fly on capital hill and in the media. so.. what will this budget really do and, more importantly, is anyone who’s talking about it being honest at all? or is the whole thing just a sham in the opening season for the 2012 elections? what the budget will really do is anyone’s guess, since these budget issues are so complex and so hard for anyone but the most dedicated pundit to follow that most of us are left confused. this means we end up depending on those few who can decipher (or at least pretend to with a straight face) the budget – most of whom have a specific axe to grind. so every analysis should be taken with a grain of salt (and two more for good measure). add to that the fact that most of what’s happening in washington right now is really just showboating on behalf of candidates or parties as they all gear up for

Article 4 - medicare and medicaid cuts will drive hospitals into bankruptcy
(before it's news) there are proposals to cut medicare and medicaid programs that could make it impossible for many hospitals to remain profitable and force doctors to stop seeing medicare patients. us lawmakers have for sometime now been struggling with facts and figures on how to cut federal spending by $$1.2 trillion over the next 10 years. as part of a deal struck earlier this month to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, a bi-partisan “supercommittee” has until nov. 23 to make recommendations for spending cuts. if congress cannot agree on a plan, automatic spending cuts will begin in 2013 – including a 2 per cent reduction in medicare reimbursements to hospitals and health care providers. that change will result in the loss of $$1.3 billion for pennsylvania hospitals alone over a nine-year period, according to michael strazzella, vice president of federal relations for the hospital and healthsystems association of pennsylvania. but proposals being studied to avoid the automatic cuts may end up being worse for hospitals, doctors and patients, experts said. suggestions include: a 30 per cent cut to medicare reimbursements to physicians, which many doctors say would force many in their ranks out of business. converting medicaid to a block grant program, which would cut pennsylvania’s share of federal funding by about 31 per cent.

Article 5 - “devastating” sequester cuts cost a total of one (1) federal job!
(before it's news) remember last year when everyone was talking about “devastating” cuts to the federal budget due to “sequestration”? as then white house flack and now-cnn crossfire host stephanie cutter defined sequestration last spring, it amounted to a “series of automatic and destructive budgets cuts that you and your neighbors are just beginning to feel.” the horror, the horror: white house tours canceled, military bands not playing, little kids starving, planes dropping from skies (not that they would have had passengers, what with the tsa lines getting infinite due to budget cuts…). yeah, no. not only were those cuts removed through a bipartisan budget deal passed early in 2014, they were hardly draconian to begin with. the cuts slated for last year totaled $$44 billion in a $$3.5 trillion budget, plus a slightly lower amount for this year and going forward. so how many federal employees got shitcanned because of reduced funds in 2013? a hundred thousand? a million? more? according to a new government accountability office (gao) report, a grand total of one (1), in the department of justice’s parole commission. #mce_temp_url# as sen. tom coburn (r-okla.) explains: “despite relentless warnings about the dire consequences of sequestration’s budget cuts, it appears sequestration resulted in only one layoff. while that’s good news for federal employees and

Article 8 - state budget crises threaten u.s. economic recovery
heading into the recession, states had substantial budget surpluses, generating record reserves. but those have now been depleted. and with federal stimulus funds dwindling, states must address remaining shortfalls with a combination of spending cuts and/or tax increases. spending cuts & tax increases not enough states have slashed spending by $$74 billion since 2008, according to the national association of state budget officers. if states continue to cut spending as they have in the current fiscal year without additional federal aid, the national economy stands to lose up to 900,000 public- and private-sector jobs according to the center on budget and policy priorities (cbpp). in response, states are taking actions to mitigate the extent of the cuts by raising taxes. since the recession began, more than 30 states have attempted to address budget shortfalls by increasing taxes. but like budget cuts, tax increases remove demand from the economy by reducing the amount of money consumers have to spend. as a result, falling revenues fail to adequately fund spending, leading to massive deficits. states have projected total budget deficits of $$127 billion through 2012, according to a report last month by the governors association and the national association of state budget officers. but the cbpp says the numbers could actually be much worse. counting year-to-date deficits, 48 states still face such shortfalls in their budgets for fiscal year 2010, totaling $$200 billion or 30% of state budgets – the largest gaps on record. and states’

Article 10 - senate dems get rough with shutdown rhetoric
senate dems get rough with shutdown rhetoric (before it's news) anyone listening to the flying rhetorical missiles here in washington tuesday would think everyone involved is heck-bent on a government shutdown, even though everyone involved says they’re not. today’s verbal brush fire was started when senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev., proposed a 30-day government funding measure that would keep the wheels turning after march 4, when the current stopgap resolution runs out. this, the leader said, would give lawmakers time to negotiate for something more long term that would include deeper spending cuts. democratic leaders claimed this plan would cut $$41 billion from the budget, a similar mathematical twist used by house republicans last week to claim they had kept a campaign promise to cut $$100 billion from the budget, a twist decried by dems. problem is, both parties are using president obama’s proposed budget for this year, a budget that was never approved. so, that’s why the house gop cuts in real time totaled $$61 billion, not $$100 billion, though still a massive number by anyone’s calculation. it’s also why it’s correct to say senate democrats are merely locking in current 2010 spending levels, a significant savings, as well. republicans, however, flatly dismissed reid’s offer, calling it disingenuous. “while leader reid claims that his plan cuts spending, all it does is lock in the status quo spending

Article 1 - house g.o.p. lays down marker with new budget plan
the white house communications director, dan pfeiffer , countered that the budget plan “fails the test of balance, fairness and shared responsibility” and would “end medicare as we know it.” house republicans understand they are placing a bet that three years of trillion-dollar deficits have prepared the electorate for monumental changes. representative tom cole, republican of oklahoma and a former national republican congressional committee chairman, conceded the move is “high risk politically.” the budget will be formally drafted on wednesday with a final house vote next week. “it’s going to be a big deal,” said mr. cole, a member of the budget and appropriations committees. “this budget was rolled out in the context of a presidential election. the house is shaping the national debate.” under the ryan plan, spending would be cut $5.3 trillion below president obama ’s budget through 2022. medicare would be shaved by $205 billion. medicaid and other health programs would be cut $770 billion. other entitlement programs, including welfare, food stamps, agriculture subsidies and transportation , would be cut by nearly $2 trillion. budget experts said that last figure was so high it could only be reached by scaling back or eliminating payments to the working poor through the earned income credit . newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional

Article 2 - ‘i will give you everything.’ here are 282 of donald trump’s campaign promises.
in donald trump’s final days on the campaign trail, he promised his supporters that “every dream you ever dreamed for your country” will come true if he becomes president — one of dozens of sweeping promises he made and is now expected to fulfill. in january, i compiled a list of 76 campaign promises trump had made. since then, the list has grown to 282, collected from trump’s speeches, public comments, tweets and campaign and transition websites. jobs 1) create at least 25 million jobs and “be the greatest jobs president that god ever created.” 2) bring back manufacturing jobs from china, mexico, japan and elsewhere. states that can expect a rush of jobs include pennsylvania, north carolina, michigan, ohio, florida, new hampshire, iowa, nevada, new york and virginia. 3) encourage manufacturers to build or grow factories in the united states with tax incentives . 4) refuse to eat another oreo until nabisco fully moves production back to the united states from mexico. 5) tell ford’s president that unless he cancels plans to build a massive plant in mexico, the auto company will face a 35 percent tax on cars imported back into the united states. trump is confident he can get this done before taking office. (trump has twice incorrectly said this has already happened.) 6) “get apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in

Article 3 - s.&p. lowers outlook for u.s., sending stocks down
“if the u.s. gets downgraded, the cost of issuing new debt will definitely increase,” said guy lebas, the chief fixed-income strategist for janney montgomery scott. “it is a question of how much.” mr. labas’s firm estimated in a study this year that there could be a 6 to 6.5 percent decline in american stocks over three months as a result of any downgrade. russell t. price, a senior economist with ameriprise financial , said that any downgrade could also hurt perceptions of the dollar and perhaps trade. “even a small increase in the interest rate being charged on that debt could add significantly to the u.s. deficit problem,” he said. on monday, the markets turned sharply lower in reaction to the news. the dow jones industrial average closed down 140.24 points, or 1.14 percent lower, at 12,201.59. it was the dow’s biggest decline since march 16. the broader s.& p. 500-stock index declined 14.54 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,305.14. the technology-heavy nasdaq lost 29.27 points, or 1.06 percent, at 2,735.38. stocks also fell across the asia -pacific region early tuesday, with the nikkei 225 index in japan down 1.5 percent by midmorning. singapore ’s main index fell

Article 4 - fy2011 federal deficit = $$1,299,000,000,000
the federal government spent $$1.299 trillion more than it received in revenue for fiscal year 2011, according to the congressional budget office's november report on monday. despite congressional efforts to cut government spending this year, federal spending increased $$145 billion over fiscal year 2010. the total national debt is now close to $$15 trillion, with over $$116 trillion in unfunded liabilities. in the 2010 elections, republicans made large electoral gains on promises to reduce federal spending. they won control of the house of representatives and gained six senate seats. the resulting divided government, with republicans in control of the house and democrats controlling the senate and presidency, set up contentious budget battles through most of 2011. at the beginning of the year, there was not even a budget for 2011. democrats decided not to pass a budget for that year under the calculation that doing so would harm their reelection chances in november 2010. after republicans gained control of the house, they wanted to cut spending from previous spending levels for the 2011 fiscal year. this led to a budget showdown in april. on the eve before a potential government shutdown, the two parties reached an agreement that cut $$38.5 billion from the previous year's spending levels for the 2010 budget. that showdown would prove mild compared to the battle over raising the nation's debt ceiling that came in july and early august. republicans argued that they would not vote to increase the

Article 5 - 2 parties predict a sharp increase in spending by u.s.
although republicans blame democrats for pushing spending ever upward, members of both parties have supported many increases as vital or at least justifiable. the cumulative effect has been a multiyear spending surge that began when the budget surplus was large and has continued now that the government is back in the red. ''we're seeing very little, if any, discipline on the spending side,'' said l. douglas lee of economics from washington, a consulting firm. ''long-term projections still show surpluses in the future, but the assumptions underlying those projections are increasingly unrealistic. large tax cuts combined with growing outlays threaten deficits as far as the eye can see.'' the rise in spending is giving the economy a lift as it comes out of the recession, economists said. but they said that if left unchecked, the deficit growth could ultimately harm the economy. mr. bush is seeking and is all but certain to get the biggest military spending increase in two decades, the centerpiece of a buildup that the two parties generally agree is justified by the threat of terrorism. spending is rising sharply in many other areas as well. congress completed work this week on a bipartisan farm-aid bill that is expected to cost billions of dollars more over the next few years than projected even a few weeks ago. in the next month or so the house will vote on a republican plan to spend $350 billion over the next decade, nearly twice what the white house had sought, on overhauling medicare and providing retirees with a prescription drug

Article 6 - budget woes expose rifts over tobacco money
at least 17 states, including california and new york, have already sold bonds based on future tobacco settlement payouts and spent some or all of the money before they have it, according to the national conference of state legislatures. moreover, cigarette taxes are also less lucrative than they were a decade ago because cigarette sales in the united states have dropped by more than 20 percent. nonetheless, two weeks into the year, conservative, tobacco-friendly states like kentucky, georgia and mississippi are considering sizable tax increases on cigarettes, while some with liberal democratic governors — including michigan, ohio and new mexico — are looking at ways to redirect tobacco settlement money to close budget gaps or for economic stimulus packages. florida lawmakers have considered both options. the state is being squeezed more than most by the vise of falling revenue and rising demand for services. in some counties, the number of families receiving food stamps has jumped more than 50 percent over the last year, while florida’s real estate collapse has brought an especially steep slide in income. photo mr. crist, a republican, has already overseen $6 billion in cuts from the state’s $66 billion budget in the last year. lawmakers meeting this week for a special session to deal with a new $2.4 billion deficit, which is expected to grow, have proposed an additional $1 billion or so in cuts. they are also calling for increases in traffic fines and raiding reserves to pay for affordable housing and other programs. yet the proposal

Article 7 - states fear double whammy from tax plan
phil angelides, the california treasurer, said, ''there is no question'' that the bush plan would cost states more and drive investors ''away from bonds that broadly benefit the public at a time we have enormous infrastructure needs.'' the national governors association said in a statement that because mr. bush's plan did not include ''direct flexible assistance'' to states, it would ''exacerbate the current state fiscal problem.'' the sluggish national economy has left many states and cities reeling. data compiled by the national conference of state legislatures shows that 43 states are operating in the red, led by california, which is facing a $34 billion budget gap for the next 18 months. over all for 2004, the states are facing their largest shortfall in half a century, as much as $85 billion, a study by the center on budget and policy priorities shows. the financial pressures have led to intense debates in many legislatures over how to balance spending cuts and new taxes to wipe out deficits. at the same time, cities are begging states and the federal government for money to cover costs of security measures since the 9/11 attacks, vaccines and long-delayed capital improvements. mr. bush said today that his plan would kick-start the sputtering economy and produce new jobs, a stimulus which would also help states with their own budget difficulties. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter.

Article 8 - opposing claims cloud the debate on an overhaul
correction appended over two days of debate on the senate floor about the motion to move ahead with the major health care legislation, democrats and republicans fired volley after volley of contradictory claims about the proposed bill. here are some examples, with analysis. how many people are projected to gain health benefits? kirsten gillibrand, democrat of new york: ''this bill will provide coverage for more than 94 percent of americans -- 98 percent when accounting for the elderly population.'' benjamin l. cardin, democrat of maryland: ''the legislation that is being brought forward by our vote later today will reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million.'' christopher s. bond, republican of missouri: ''the bill still leaves 24 million americans without insurance.'' jeff sessions, republican of alabama: ''they are going to provide methods and additional funding and provide millions of people with insurance who didn't have it before, although 24 million will remain uninsured.'' according to the congressional budget office, there will be roughly 50 million people without health insurance in the united states in 2010, with the number rising to 54 million by 2019 under current law. the budget office says the senate bill would reduce the number of uninsured to 24 million by 2019, effectively providing coverage to 31 million. the budget office says the senate bill would cover 92 percent of non-elderly americans, 94 percent if illegal immigrants were

Article 9 - a new volley from boehner in spending dispute
“the house has passed legislation to keep the government running until october while cutting spending,” mr. boehner said in a statement. “if senator reid refuses to bring it to a vote, then the house will pass a short-term bill to keep the government running — one that also cuts spending. senate democratic leaders are insisting on a status quo that has left us with a mountain of debt and a stalled economy with unemployment near 10 percent.” mr. boehner added, “republicans’ goal is to cut spending and reduce the size of government, not to shut it down.” republicans are trying to make the case that senate democratic leaders are interested in preserving the status quo and are refusing to entertain even small cuts. republicans say they believe a temporary measure with some spending reductions could pass the senate with support from republicans and more centrist democrats. democrats said republicans drew a line in the sand with mr. boehner’s stated refusal last week to consider a temporary extension unless it contained new cuts, even before he had engaged in any negotiations. in a conference call with reporters, mr. reid and senator charles e. schumer of new york, the no. 3 democrat, said that they knew they had to make cuts but that there was not enough time to do so before the stopgap measure runs out. photo and they insisted that the current stopgap already includes major cuts because on an annualized basis it would spend $41

Article 10 - as a debt battle looms, budget veterans see no option but to raise taxes
the two budget deals last year — the deficit-reduction compromise in august and a smaller agreement before that — called for cutting $1.7 trillion from so-called discretionary spending, which covers the bulk of federal programs whose budgets congress controls annually, including air-traffic control, the military, education, research and much more. those deals left unscathed the entitlement programs like medicare, medicaid and social security, which, given the growing aging population, are driving projections of unsustainable deficits. and those deals, because of republicans’ resistance, did not raise taxes, unlike the deficit measures of the 1980s and 1990s. “tax hikes destroy jobs,” mr. boehner said in his speech on tuesday. but veterans of past budget wars say that discretionary spending for domestic programs, which make up just 15 percent of the federal budget, cannot continue to bear the brunt without significant implications for government services. “they’ve gone way past fat and are cutting into muscle,” said bruce r. bartlett, who was a treasury official in the reagan administration. nor, these people say, would the public support the deeper reductions that would have to be made in programs like medicare if taxes are not part of the mix. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and

Budget Battles Intensify as Deficit Concerns Mount

The US government is facing a growing deficit crisis, with lawmakers struggling to find common ground on spending cuts and tax increases. The White House has proposed a budget plan that would cut $5.3 trillion in spending over the next decade, but critics argue it would harm vulnerable populations.

Meanwhile, presidential candidates have made sweeping promises about their plans for economic growth and job creation. One candidate has vowed to create at least 25 million new jobs, while another has promised to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas.

However, experts warn that the current deficit trajectory could ultimately harm the economy. ""We're seeing very little, if any, discipline on the spending side,"" said one economist. The government's debt ceiling is also a pressing concern, with some lawmakers calling for a downgrade that would increase borrowing costs and hurt the economy.

States are also feeling the pinch, with many operating in the red due to declining revenue and rising demand for services. Some states are considering tax increases or cuts to balance their budgets, while others are seeking federal assistance to cover costs such as security measures and capital improvements.

As the budget battle intensifies, lawmakers are facing pressure from both parties to find a solution. ""The house has passed legislation to keep the government running until October while cutting spending,"" said one Republican leader. However, Democrats argue that any cuts would be too deep and would harm vulnerable populations.

With the debt ceiling looming large, it's clear that the US government

FAKE NEWS ARTICLE
-----------------
Washington D.C. - As the nation's lawmakers return to Capitol Hill, a pressing issue looms: how to address the growing national debt and stimulate economic growth. President Barack Obama is set to propose a $300 billion spending package and tax cuts on Thursday night, aiming to create jobs and boost the economy.

However, not everyone is convinced that this plan will work. Republicans have proposed their own budget resolution, which would cut $4.4 trillion from the national deficit over the next decade. While some experts argue that these cuts are necessary to avoid further economic instability, others warn that they could lead to devastating consequences for certain industries and individuals.

One area of concern is the potential impact on hospitals and healthcare providers. Proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid programs could force many hospitals into bankruptcy, leading to a shortage of medical services and increased costs for patients.

Meanwhile, some Americans are more concerned with the long-term effects of these spending cuts. Nobel laureate John Bennett warns that the U.S. economy is ""slowly becoming more depressed"" due to excessive government spending, which will only exacerbate poverty and economic instability.

As lawmakers continue to debate and negotiate, one thing is clear: the fate of the nation's economy hangs in the balance. With the sequester cuts already having a minimal impact on federal employees, it remains to be seen whether these measures will have any significant effect on the broader economy.

The Benghazi attack, which occurred on September 11, 2012, has been shrouded in controversy and speculation for years. The Obama administration's handling of the situation has been widely criticized, with many accusing them of a cover-up.

A recent report released by the House Select Committee on Benghazi revealed new criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was a key figure in the administration at the time. The report highlighted discrepancies in the administration's narrative and raised questions about the role of the CIA in the attack.

Despite the administration's efforts to downplay the incident, evidence has continued to emerge that suggests a more sinister plot was involved. Whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of a secret war in North Africa and the Middle East, which were allegedly overseen by former CIA Director John Brennan at the direction of President Barack Obama.

The White House has been called upon to release emails related to the editing of CIA talking points, which some believe were manipulated to downplay the attack. The demand for transparency comes as the administration faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of the situation.

As the investigation into the Benghazi attack continues, many are calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed to oversee the inquiry. This would ensure that all parties involved are held accountable and that the truth is uncovered.

The public's trust in government has been eroded by the ongoing controversy surrounding Benghazi. It is essential that those responsible for the cover-up are brought to justice and that the American people receive the answers they deserve.

With the release of new information and the growing demand for transparency, it remains to be seen whether the Obama administration will finally provide the truth about the Benghazi attack.","Investigations into Government Accountability and Transparency

In recent months, several high-profile investigations have shed light on government accountability and transparency. A special House committee, established to investigate the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, has been pushing for answers about the Obama administration's response to the episode.

The committee's chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, has criticized the administration's handling of the situation, including its initial description of the attackers as ""terrorists"" and its denial of security requests from the State Department. The investigation has also raised questions about the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the matter.

Meanwhile, a growing number of high-level leaks have been fueling concerns about President Trump's fitness for office. These leaks, which appear to be part of a coordinated effort, have been described as a ""soft coup"" by some experts.

In addition, a report by the Pentagon's inspector general has criticized the Defense Department's compilation of alternative intelligence that supported the invasion of Iraq. The report's findings have raised questions about the role of senior officials in shaping policy and the use of classified information to justify military action.

These investigations highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability in government. As one commentator noted, ""the best journalism includes an awful lot to be proud of,"" but also acknowledges that there are failures and shortcomings that must be addressed.

The push for greater transparency is particularly important in light of recent revelations about government surveillance programs and the use of classified information. As one former CIA officer noted, ""true-blue"" officials should not stoop to taking unnecessary risks or engaging in secretive behavior.

Ultimately, these investigations demonstrate the importance of a free press and an independent judiciary in holding those in power accountable for their actions.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

benghazi cover up continues to backfire on obama % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) this past sunday’s news shows were unbelievable. it was reminiscent of susan rice’s talk show appearances from almost 8 months ago! each side of benghazi had their own “talking points!” but, finally, the obama administration was caught in a lie, one that even the liberal press cannot cover up, and try as they may. apparently, the obama administration has 12 different versions when they “scrubbed” the talking points made by susan rice on five network appearances last year on benghazi. no matter what side of the aisle one is on, it is more than obvious that the killings in benghazi had an extreme cover-up, stretching all the way to the oval office. unfortunately, it’s all about “talking points” and not about the four patriotic americans who were murdered. democrats are trying to figure out how to minimize the damage from the cover-up; and the republicans are strategizing on how to use the cover-up to their own political advantage. what about the four american families that have been waiting eight long months for real answers to their family members were murdered? that’s why we need a select committee to fully investigate the benghazi terrorist attacks! please fax today! reuters reports: “a top republican on sunday said he expected more witnesses to step

unraveling the benghazi cover-up headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by douglas j. hagmann 3 may 2013: it will be exactly 40 years ago this may 17th that the senate watergate committee, a special, broad committee convened by the united states senate, began hearings to investigate the watergate burglaries and a criminal cover-up of those activities. at the epicenter of those hearings was then-president richard nixon. just over a year later, the committee released its 1,254 page report of findings. when the dust settled, forty administration officials were indicted and several of nixon’s aides were charged and convicted for obstruction of justice and other crimes. a cover-up pointed directly to the white house. facing impeachment proceedings, then-president richard m. nixon resigned, assuming his place in american history as the only president ever to resign. it was described as the worst scandal in u.s. history… perhaps until now. if history tells us anything, it tells us that it’s not just about the crime, it’s also about the cover-up. it’s about seeking the truth but being stonewalled at every turn, and being treated as subjects undeserving of the truth rather than citizens asking reasonable questions but being denied answers. the same level of inquiries that unraveled the complexities of the watergate cover-up are required to unravel the ball of lies that surrounds the september 11

video washington — the chairman of the special house committee created to investigate the 2012 terrorist attacks in benghazi, libya, pushed back wednesday against critics who have called for him to abandon his efforts, saying “we should not move on” until more questions about the episode are answered. at a hearing on capitol hill, the lawmaker, representative trey gowdy, republican of south carolina, continued the republicans’ criticism of how the obama administration and former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton responded to the episode. mr. gowdy asked why the administration did not initially use the word “terrorist” to describe those behind the attacks, in which four americans were killed, and why the state department’s requests for more security for its diplomatic compound were denied. “i remain keenly aware that there are those on both sides of the aisle who have concluded that all questions have been answered, there is nothing left to do, no more witnesses to talk to, no more documents to review,” mr. gowdy said. “it is worth noting that some of those very same folks did not think that benghazi should have been looked at in the first place.” advertisement continue reading the main story the hearing occurred more than two weeks after the republican-controlled house intelligence committee released the sixth government report on the benghazi attacks. the report said that the administration had not intentionally misled the public about what had happened. it also said that the military

Article 2 - is glenn greenwald the future of news?
but the kind of journalism the times and other mainstream news organizations practice — at their best — includes an awful lot to be proud of, too, revelations from watergate to torture and secret prisons to the malfeasance of the financial industry, and including some pre-snowden revelations about the n.s.a.’s abuse of its authority. those are highlights that leap to mind, but you’ll find examples in just about every day’s report. journalists in this tradition have plenty of opinions, but by setting them aside to follow the facts — as a judge in court is supposed to set aside prejudices to follow the law and the evidence — they can often produce results that are more substantial and more credible. the mainstream press has had its failures — episodes of credulousness, false equivalency, sensationalism and inattention — for which we have been deservedly flogged. i expect you’ll say, not flogged enough. so i pass you the lash. dear bill, there’s no question that journalists at establishment media venues, certainly including the new york times, have produced some superb reporting over the last couple of decades. i don’t think anyone contends that what has become (rather recently) the standard model for a reporter — concealing one’s subjective perspectives or what appears to be “opinions” — precludes good journalism. but this model has also produced lots of atrocious journalism and some toxic habits that are weakening the profession. a journalist who is petrified of appearing to express any

Article 3 - the tangled threads of russia-gate
exclusive: once a washington groupthink takes hold, as it has in the fervent belief about russia-gate, respect for facts and logic fly out the window since all these important people can’t be wrong, writes robert parry. by robert parry a curious feature about the russia-gate “scandal” is that its proponents ignore the growing number of moments when their evidence undercuts their narrative. instead, they press ahead toward a predetermined destination in much the way that true-believing conspiracy theorists are known to do. for instance, the new york times ran a story on monday, entitled “operative offered trump campaign access to putin,” detailing how a conservative operative “told a trump adviser that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between donald j. trump and vladimir v. putin, the russian president, according to an email sent to the trump campaign” — and apparently described to the times by a helpful source on capitol hill. the times quoted the email from national rifle association member paul erickson to trump campaign adviser rick dearborn as saying, “putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with mr. trump. … [putin] wants to extend an invitation to mr. trump to visit him in the kremlin before the election.” an nra conference in louisville, kentucky, was supposed to be the location for the “first contact” between the russians and the trump campaign, according to the email. the

Article 4 - save the endangered whistle-blower
if ever government whistle-blowers needed protection from official retaliation it is now, in the secrecy-obsessed bush administration. federal employees daring to disclose fraud and abuse in their bureaucracies have been under virtual siege, isolated as pariahs and shipped off under gag orders to lesser jobs in far-off places. appeals to court review under the 17-year-old whistle-blower protection act have proved fruitless, with the supreme court ruling in may that workers have no right to first amendment protection when they warn lawmakers and taxpayers of government waste and folly. the ruling has thrown the issue back into the lap of congress. fortunately, there is enough anger emerging on both sides of the aisle to raise hopes for remedial legislation. the senate has unanimously approved an amendment to close loopholes and spell out whistle-blowers’ rights in more forceful detail for the courts. it is attached to a pending military bill, with proponents working for comparably tough legislation to be accepted by the house. the outcome is not certain. the justice department has been opposed to strengthening the law, and a countermove is afoot to give the administration even more power to prosecute whistle-blowers as leakers of official secrets. the coming showdown is a chance for electioneering incumbents to take a stand against the administration’s mania for foiling the public’s right to government transparency. the best display of congressional intent would be for lawmakers to not just reaffirm the 1989 law but to extend it to

Article 5 - accountability and the torture report
to the editor: re “pardon bush and those who tortured,” by anthony d. romero (op- ed, dec. 9), and “white house and g.o.p. clash over torture report” (front page, dec. 9): mr. romero’s ingenious proposal to pardon those who authorized america’s torture crimes to acknowledge that crimes were committed has the added benefit that such an action by president obama would not be subject to review by congress. the senate report on torture by the united states government may make clear that such pardons may be the best way to begin the redemption of our nation’s tarnished reputation. former vice president dick cheney seems to miss the irony that he asked that the senate report remain secret while simultaneously declaring that those who abetted the torture (presumably including himself) should be “decorated, not criticized.” logically, the first step toward receiving the praise he feels is due is the report’s publication so that the actions of these individuals, and their consequences, could be appreciated by all. carl mezoff stamford, conn., dec. 9, 2014 to the editor: after the 9/11 attacks, both democrats and republicans in washington scrambled to quickly get a handle on the shadowy qaeda organization and prevent future devastating attacks. the c.i.a. was accepted as the lead agency for this effort, and all of its aggressive tactics were known — and financed — for years

Article 6 - why nyt dissed the ‘drone papers’
when the “downing street memo” surfaced in the uk in 2006 revealing that the intelligence to justify the iraq war had been “fixed” around the policy, the mainstream u.s. media largely ignored it . the same has now happened with the leak of documents about president obama’s drone war, writes john hanrahan. by john hanrahan for that slice of the american public that still depends heavily on major daily newspapers as their main source of news, they might not even know that the on-line publication the intercept has published a package of alarming drone-assassination articles based on secret military documents provided by an anonymous intelligence whistleblower. these “ drone papers ” show, among other disclosures, that the u.s. government has been lying about the number of civilian deaths caused by drone strikes in afghanistan, yemen and somalia. for every targeted individual assassinated, another five or six non-targeted individuals are killed, giving the lie to the obama administration’s long-standing claims of careful, precision killing of specific targets in order to avoid killing civilians. the intercept, relying on a cache of slides provided to it by its whistleblower source, posted its package of eight articles on oct. 15, 2015. among those picking up on the stories was the huffington post (which ran excerpts), and other outlets, including the guardian, newsweek, new york magazine, npr, the pbs newshour, cnn , which generally cited some of

Article 7 - ex-worker at c.i.a. says he leaked data on surveillance
mr. snowden, who said he was seeking asylum abroad, perhaps in iceland, gave the interview to the guardian, the british newspaper and global web site that during the past week published a string of articles about classified national security agency programs. both the guardian and the washington post, which also published articles disclosing the surveillance programs, identified mr. snowden on sunday as the source for their articles. in his interview with the guardian, mr. snowden said his job had given him access to myriad secrets that the united states government guards most jealously, including the locations of central intelligence agency stations overseas and the identities of undercover agents working for the united states. but he said he had been selective in what he disclosed, releasing only what he found to be the greatest abuses of a surveillance state that he came to view as reckless and having grown beyond reasonable boundaries. he was alternately defiant and resigned, saying at one point that the c.i.a. might try to spirit him out of china, and speculating that it might even hire asian gangs to go after him. “if you realize that that’s the world you helped create and it is going to get worse with the next generation and the next generation and extend the capabilities of this architecture of oppression, you realize that you might be willing to accept any risks and it doesn’t matter what the outcome is,” mr. snowden said. some outside experts said the push in recent years to break down barriers between spy agencies and share information across the

Article 8 - do high-level leaks suggest a conspiracy?
widespread concern inside official washington about president trump’s unfitness for the job is fueling a campaign of high-level leaks that is taking on the look of a “soft coup,” says ex-cia officer philip giraldi. by philip giraldi back in my time in the cia, there were two places in the headquarters building one could go that were free speech zones — places where it was safe to vent about senior management without necessarily being admonished or even reported. they were the historical intelligence collection room off the library, where no one ever went to look at the books, and the office supplies storage room in the basement. the supplies room had a lot of dark corners and concealing shelves where it was possible to be anonymous and it was completely unsupervised in the belief that true-blue cia officers would never stoop to taking even a single pencil more than was actually needed to get the job done. i don’t know if those rooms still exist, but i sometimes think of them when the subject of government conspiracies come up. i have this vision of two or three conspirators huddled in the corner behind the staplers back in 1975 discussing how one would go about eliminating the likes of senator frank church, who at that time was heading a major congressional investigation into cia improprieties. if there had been such a gathering, i would imagine that the washington post would have found out about it on the next day as intelligence officers are gregarious and

Article 9 - inquiry on intelligence gaps may reach to white house
the chairman of the senate armed services committee said friday that he would ask current and former white house aides to testify about a report by the pentagon's inspector general that criticizes the pentagon for compiling ''alternative intelligence'' that made the case for invading iraq. the chairman, senator carl levin, democrat of michigan, said that among those called to testify could be stephen j. hadley, the national security adviser, and i. lewis libby, a former chief of staff for vice president dick cheney. both received a briefing from the defense secretary's policy office in 2002 on possible links between al qaeda and saddam hussein's government. in its report on thursday, the acting inspector general, thomas f. gimble, found that the work done by the pentagon team, which was assembled by douglas j. feith, a former under secretary of defense for policy, was ''not fully supported by the available intelligence.'' it was not clear whether mr. hadley and mr. libby would testify. the white house normally resists having top aides testify before congress. the senate intelligence committee may also seek to question the men. tara andringa, a spokeswoman for mr. levin, said mr. levin planned to consult with senator john d. rockefeller iv, democrat of west virginia and chairman of that committee. mr. levin is on both committees. the inspector general's report found that while

Benghazi Cover-Up Continues to Erode Public Trust

The Benghazi attack, which occurred on September 11, 2012, has been shrouded in controversy and speculation for years. The Obama administration's handling of the situation has been widely criticized, with many accusing them of a cover-up.

A recent report released by the House Select Committee on Benghazi revealed new criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was a key figure in the administration at the time. The report highlighted discrepancies in the administration's narrative and raised questions about the role of the CIA in the attack.

Despite the administration's efforts to downplay the incident, evidence has continued to emerge that suggests a more sinister plot was involved. Whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of a secret war in North Africa and the Middle East, which were allegedly overseen by former CIA Director John Brennan at the direction of President Barack Obama.

The White House has been called upon to release emails related to the editing of CIA talking points, which some believe were manipulated to downplay the attack. The demand for transparency comes as the administration faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of the situation.

As the investigation into the Benghazi attack continues, many are calling for a special prosecutor to be appointed to oversee the inquiry. This would ensure that all parties involved are held accountable and that the truth is uncovered.

The public's trust in government has been eroded by the ongoing controversy surrounding Benghazi. It is essential that those responsible for the cover-up

Investigations into Government Accountability and Transparency

In recent months, several high-profile investigations have shed light on government accountability and transparency. A special House committee, established to investigate the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, has been pushing for answers about the Obama administration's response to the episode.

The committee's chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, has criticized the administration's handling of the situation, including its initial description of the attackers as ""terrorists"" and its denial of security requests from the State Department. The investigation has also raised questions about the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the matter.

Meanwhile, a growing number of high-level leaks have been fueling concerns about President Trump's fitness for office. These leaks, which appear to be part of a coordinated effort, have been described as a ""soft coup"" by some experts.

In addition, a report by the Pentagon's inspector general has criticized the Defense Department's compilation of alternative intelligence that supported the invasion of Iraq. The report's findings have raised questions about the role of senior officials in shaping policy and the use of classified information to justify military action.

These investigations highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability in government. As one commentator noted, ""the best journalism includes an awful lot to be proud of,"" but also acknowledges that there are failures and shortcomings that must be addressed.

The push for greater transparency is particularly important in light of recent revelations about government surveillance programs and the use of classified information. As one former CIA officer

The article ""Gun Industry Shifts Strategy Amid Growing Scrutiny"" is a more comprehensive and detailed piece of journalism compared to the given article. It provides context on the broader issue of gun control, including the efforts of cities and counties to punish manufacturers with lawsuits, as well as the proposed legislation aimed at reducing demand for guns.  In contrast, the fake news article ""A Growing Concern: The Impact of Ammunition Shortages on Gun Owners"" presents a fictional scenario about ammunition shortages and their impact on gun owners. It lacks factual evidence and is not supported by credible sources. Therefore, it is classified as FAKE NEWS.","A Growing Concern: The Impact of Ammunition Shortages on Gun Owners

In recent months, gun owners across the country have faced a growing concern: ammunition shortages. Retailers such as Walmart and Hot Shot Sports have imposed limits on how much ammo customers can buy, citing unprecedented demand following high-profile shootings.

The shortage has led to creative solutions among gun enthusiasts. Some are making their own ammo from scratch or re-loading casings from previously shot rounds. This trend is not limited to individual consumers; some manufacturers are also exploring alternative methods to meet the growing demand.

However, lawmakers have taken notice of the issue and are proposing legislation to address it. Representative Tom Rooney has introduced a bill aimed at blocking federal regulations that would restrict certain types of ammunition.

The impact of these shortages extends beyond the gun industry. Some states have ballot initiatives that could affect gun laws, while others have seen a rise in anti-gun sentiment among politicians.

As the debate over gun control continues, it's clear that ammunition shortages are having a significant impact on gun owners and the broader community. With tensions running high, it's essential to consider the long-term effects of these shortages and the potential consequences for Second Amendment rights.

In some areas, retailers have reported widespread disregard for certain laws, leading to concerns about the erosion of societal norms. Meanwhile, government agencies are taking steps to regulate ammunition production, citing environmental concerns.

As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the impact of ammunition shortages on gun owners and the broader community will be felt for a long time to come.","Gun Industry Shifts Strategy Amid Growing Scrutiny

In a move aimed at mitigating the risks associated with increased gun control efforts, Sturm, Ruger & Company has instructed its distributors to avoid selling their firearms at gun shows. The company's president and vice chairman, William B. Ruger Jr., stated that the decision is intended to ensure that their products are sold exclusively from regular business locations.

This shift in strategy comes as the gun industry faces mounting pressure from cities and counties seeking to punish manufacturers with lawsuits similar to those used against tobacco companies. As a result, some lawmakers have proposed legislation aimed at reducing demand for guns by adequately financing treatment, rehabilitation, and education programs.

Meanwhile, Connecticut has taken steps to strengthen its gun control laws, with Governor Dannel P. Malloy supporting a ban on high-capacity magazines despite it not being included in the final legislative package. The state's efforts are seen as an attempt to establish itself as a leader in gun safety legislation.

The gun industry's response to these developments has been mixed, with some manufacturers exploring new revenue streams through the sale of branded merchandise and other products. However, others have seen their stocks plummet following Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is expected to reduce fears about new gun control laws.

As the debate over gun control continues, it remains to be seen how the industry will adapt to the changing landscape. With lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushing for stricter regulations, manufacturers must navigate a complex web of competing interests and priorities.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

don’t let the election distract you from these anti-gun ballots (before it's news) if you’re like me, the 2016 election has you wishing to take your pick of the one-way trips to mars in the hope that the next american president has too many budget squabbles with congress to meddle in the goings on of the red planet. but the lack of good choices offered by the major parties is no reason to stay home on the 8th of november. it’s clear from the polls that hillary clinton will win the race for the presidency. as unpleasant a sentence as that was to write, there’s no point in denying reality. the senate is up for grabs, with current projections expecting fifty republicans, forty-eight democrats, and two independents, angus king and bernie sanders, who caucus with the democrats. that would leave control of the upper chamber to the tie-breaking vote of the vice president, tim kaine. the house of representatives, by contrast, will remain in republican control, as will three-fifths of the state governor’s mansions. this all means that regarding some races, voters can make a real difference, while the house and states will continue to be a brake on clinton’s dreams of gun grabbing. but our democracy isn’t limited to selecting representatives for offices. most states also have some provision for ballot initiatives, brought forth—at least in theory—by the voters themselves, while others require submitting the measure

tommey-manchin sellout bill is worse than feinstein gun ban (before it's news) senators pat toomey (r-pa) and joe manchin (d-wv) are authoring a “see a shrink, lose your guns” sell-out bill that gun owners of america claims is “worse than the feinstein gun ban, which will reportedly be tied to it and offered simultaneously in a senate procedure known as an ‘amendment tree.’” this bill not only is being authored by these guys, but has senator chuck schumer’s (d-ny) fingerprints all over it. toomey and manchin will claim that their bill only covers “gun show sales” and internet sales. however, if you’ve ever talked about your gun and /or let it be known you’d like to sell or buy a gun on the internet, this language covers you. if you advertise your gun in the church bulletin and the bulletin is put on the internet, you’re covered. the only exemption is for sales that are sold exclusively by word of mouth. the increased number of background checks would likely exacerbate the system breakdowns (inherent to nics) which have shut down gun shows over and over again. it would mean that americans who were illegally denied firearms because their names were similar to other people would effectively be barred from owning a gun.

(before it's news) prices to rise sharply as america’s last lead supplier calls it quits mac slavo activist post a couple of years ago we opined that the anti-gun establishment had found a loophole for the second amendment and that rather than targeting the banning of all firearms, they would instead turn their attention to ammunition. the government’s most recent efforts to reduce open market availability through taxation, individual purchase restrictions and a massive stockpiling effort by the department of homeland security has forced ammunition prices to nearly triple, while also dwindling supplies of many popular calibers. but they’re not done yet. in fact, they may have finally found a way to circumvent u.s.-based domestic production altogether. the all-out attack on americans’ gun rights is now being taken to the next level. the goal is to regulate all forms of ammunition out of existence, and they’re starting with doe run, which is the last of america’s domestic lead processing and manufacturing facilities. now, the only ore-to-lead producer in america… the largest in the western world… has been shut down by epa regulation. epa’s regulatory uncertainty and an estimated $$100 million to convert [to non-smelter manufacturing] caused the company to finally throw in the towel. it’s not just ammunition that’s disappearing. american industry… american jobs…. are being regulated out of existence as well

Article 10 - nfl players upset their anthem protest isn’t working anymore, just teamed up with obama to screw america in new way
it wasn’t enough for spoiled “oppressed” millionaire athletes to complete destroy our favorite pass time with their anti-american antics. now kaepernick and pals are making things extremely personal, going straight after patriotic americans and outrageously labeling those who disagree with their protests as “racists” who don’t care about black people being killed by cops. after a successful onslaught on america’s patriotism, these idiots are now going straight after the second amendment and pushing an obama-initiated gun grab, as their bold move to erase everything that our country stands for reaches astonishing new levels. if there’s one thing we’ve learned from these ongoing protests, it’s that these ungrateful athletes have no concept of what being an american truly means, otherwise these players wouldn’t choose to disrespect our soldiers who fought for their freedoms every time they take a knee. these protests are nothing but a political ploy to demonize “white america,” as we continue to see these athletes throwing up black power salutes when they tackle white players as a way for these racist atheltes to proclaim their “supremacy” over the white race. so it should come as no surprise that these communist-loving racists would go straight after the one thing that sets america apart from any other country in the world, our second amendment rights. sean hannity reported: the same nfl players who choose to “take a knee” in protest of racial injustice in america are now turning their sights on the us constitution; targeting the second

Article 1 - gun maker tells resellers to avoid firearms shows
sturm, ruger & company, the connecticut firearms manufacturer, has instructed its distributors in its latest contracts not to sell its weapons at gun shows, company officials said yesterday. in contracts this year, sturm, ruger says its firearms should be supplied only ''to federally licensed firearms dealers selling exclusively from their regular place of business,'' william b. ruger jr., the president and vice chairman of the southport, conn., company, said in a telephone interview yesterday. the move was first reported yesterday, by the denver post. ''if it has not been precisely those words for the last 20 years, the effect has been precisely the same,'' mr. ruger said. ''what we do say and have intimated is that we expect that they will confine their sales to gun shops which are true gun shops in business parts of town with regular hours.'' the policy, which industry experts believe is the first of its kind, comes as sturm, ruger and other gun makers try to fend off more than two dozen lawsuits from cities and counties hoping to punish gun makers with a strategy similar to the one used against tobacco companies. it also comes as the clinton administration is considering inserting itself further into the gun control debate by suing manufacturers on behalf of those living in federal public housing complexes, industry analysts and government officials said. advertisement continue reading the main story sturm, ruger officials would not say how they would respond if a distributor was found in violation of the contract

Article 2 - legislative deal prompts run on connecticut gun shops
“we’ve got a fire sale going on here,” he said. “whatever doesn’t sell by the time they pass this law is going to be useless. basically, $100,000 worth of paperweights. ” one customer, john gursky, 22, of new milford, was stocking up on 30-round magazines and ammunition he said he uses recreationally. “nothing they’re trying to pass right now is going to help the crime rate. it’s only going to make it worse,” he said. but legislators, many sandy hook elementary school families, gun-control groups and big-city mayors praised the legislation. on monday, families representing 11 of those who died at sandy hook called for a ban on the possession of high-capacity magazines, which was not included in the final legislative package. but gov. dannel p. malloy, who had supported the ban, said on tuesday that he would sign the legislation anyway. and sandy hook promise, the group representing the families of the 11 victims, said that adding the requirement to register existing magazines strengthened the legislation considerably. “we thank the legislature for passing the strongest gun responsibility legislation in the nation,” the group said in a statement. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's

Article 3 - futility in colombia
to the editor: re ''a web of drugs and strife in colombia'' (front page, april 21): why is that both president clinton and congress insist on fighting this unwinnable war when, for a fraction of the cost, they could reduce demand for drugs by adequately financing treatment, rehabilitation and education programs, and by decriminalizing drug use? the government is ignoring both the laws of supply and demand and the lessons of the prohibition era. by effectively reducing demand, this war can be won without firing a single shot. miguel cima, m.d. garden city, n.y., april 23, 2000

Article 4 - black friday was a record-breaking day for gun background checks in america (swhc, rgr)
whitney curtis/getty images black friday was a record-breaking day for gun background checks in america. the fbi processed 185,713 background checks for buyers through its national instant criminal background check system (nics.) that was nearly 400 more transactions than the bureau processed on black friday 2015, the bureau's stephen fischer jr. told business insider. black friday is usually the biggest day of the year for gun sales, as buyers take advantage of deep discounts. gun ownership remains a politically charged issue. demand and sales are typically expected to surge when washington is seen to take a harder approach to regulations and ease of access. gunmaker sturm, ruger & co. said in its third-quarter earnings statement that demand for guns was stronger than usual during the summer, likely driven by election-related rhetoric. president-elect donald trump's gun-control proposals included better mental-health treatment programs, while ensuring that laws did not infringe on second amendment rights that allow for ownership. however, his democratic rival hillary clinton supported an assault-weapons ban and an expansion of background checks. gun stocks plummeted after trump's victory as investors realized that customers would no longer rush to buy out of fear that clinton would make ownership harder. since november 9, the day after the election, sturm ruger is down 18%, while rival smith & wesson is down 17%. both stocks were little changed on monday.

Article 5 - years after sale, handgun haunts ex-owner in court
''this is a real stretch,'' said mitch pearlstein, the president of the center of the american experiment, a conservative research organization in minneapolis. ''it reminds me of these cases we're seeing now of landlords being held responsible for the misbehavior of their tenants.'' advocates of gun control, meanwhile, say the case demonstrates the importance of the laws on transferring guns. if the gun had been properly registered, they say, it would be less likely that the weapon would have fallen into dangerous hands. nancy hwa, a spokeswoman for handgun control in washington, defended the notion of a ''chain of responsibility that the gun industry and gun owners bear for their product.'' mr. walker, in an interview this week at the macomb county jail, said he was shocked when police officers arrived at his home in capac, mich., last month and arrested him. ''i remember hearing about the shooting of the cop, and i feel bad for him and his family,'' mr. walker said. ''but i had nothing to do with it.'' eric kaiser, a prosecutor in the case, said it was ''not relevant'' whether mr. walker knew the killer, nor did it matter how many times the gun might have changed hands after mr. walker sold it. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates

Article 6 - finding offshoots for profit
smith & wesson, which started selling guns in 1852 and became a fixture of popular culture through clint eastwood's use of its .44 magnum revolver in ''dirty harry'' movies, has opened retail stores where customers can buy the gun maker's logo on jewelry, gym bags, mountain bikes -- even teddy bears. (the company, whose sales plummeted after it pledged to install safety devices on its guns, was sold last month by its british owner, tomkins p.l.c., to the saf-t-hammer corporation, a start-up in arizona that makes trigger locks.) firearms from fabbrica d'armi pietro beretta s.p.a., the 475-year-old italian arms manufacturer, can be found at the beretta gallery on madison avenue in manhattan, a boutique with a facade of hand-chiseled stone extracted from quarries in italy. but they are on the mezzanine. the main emphasis is selling other high-end items that seek to build on beretta's patrician image: books on african game hunting, beretta-branded sportswear, hand-painted porcelain and engraved knives. then there is sturm, ruger & company, the nation's largest publicly traded handgun company. sturm, whose stock has declined by more than 60 percent in the last five years, is getting into the golf business by making use of its metal casting operations. the company's ''great big bertha''

Article 7 - negotiators reach compromise on defense bill
the way the pentagon deal was struck reflected the dysfunction that has marked the current congress. negotiators from the house and senate armed services committees found common ground on the sprawling measure even though a senate version had yet to pass, and some senate republicans were furious that they once again had been denied the right to offer multiple amendments. it was not immediately clear that senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, would go along, although with the military’s ability to issue combat and hazard pay set to expire dec. 31, pressure to act will be great. but in the strange first session of the 113th congress, precedent has rarely held, and in a legislative year that is likely to go down in history as the least productive ever, monday’s accord on defense policy was something of a victory for congress. “this isn’t the way we’d like to do it,” said senator james m. inhofe of oklahoma, the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee. “it’s the only way we could do it.” the house passed its annual pentagon policy bill this summer, but the senate’s version has been pending for weeks, bogged down in a dispute over the number of republican amendments that would be allowed to come to a vote. as republican and democratic leaders battled over procedure, the house and senate armed services committees negotiated behind the scenes on a compromise bill. the measure is the first change to law governing sexual assault in the military in

Article 8 - your state’s gun control just got stricter? come on down!
“gun manufacturers and people in that industry have been under attack by states who are threatening their second amendment rights,” mr. estes said. “we want them to realize that texas is open for business and texas is a gun-friendly state.” when the legislation was considered recently before the senate agriculture, rural affairs and homeland security committee, no one testified against it. one committee member, senator carlos uresti, democrat of san antonio, voted against the bill, but his opposition had less to do with guns and more to do with giving the governor what mr. uresti called “a blank check to offer a variety of tax exemptions and other incentives” to such manufacturers. mr. uresti, whose committee vote will mean the bill will probably be debated by the full senate, rather than sliding through on the little-scrutinized local and uncontested calendar, argued that any businesses that wanted to move to texas should share the full burden of financing state services. “according to the comptroller’s office, such tax breaks this year will cost the state $37.7 billion and school districts $6.2 billion in lost revenue,” he said. “i’m not against attracting gun and ammunition manufacturers to texas.” mr. perry said he did not need legislation to use state resources to recruit businesses to texas; his activities related to gun makers are just a part of his overall economic development strategy. but, he added, “often there are pieces of legislation that get filed that send a

Article 9 - after other states’ moves, connecticut is still working on stricter gun law
“my mantra at the beginning was it is important to act quickly, but it is more important to act intelligently,” mr. sharkey said in an interview. he added, “i’m personally very confident that what we produce will give connecticut the strongest gun safety legislation in the country when we’re done.” after the tragedy, connecticut created a somewhat confusing process, with one commission established by governor malloy to research guns, violence and mental health issues and a separate task force set up by the legislature. republicans and democrats on the legislative task force agreed on many elements of a gun-control package but offered separate reports. both sides called for universal background checks, greater safe-storage requirements and more requirements for buying ammunition. only democrats called for expanding the existing assault-weapons ban to cover a broader array of weapons and for a ban on magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. photo but democratic and republican leaders indicated that the fact they were still talking was evidence that those two elements could be part of bipartisan legislation. and larry cafero, the house republican leader, said passing legislation roughly four months after the shootings would be extraordinary given the complexity of the issues. colorado’s legislation came eight months after the mass murder in aurora, colo., last summer, mr. sharkey noted. alluding to new york’s experience, mr. cafero said, “to be the first out of the blocks and get it wrong is not a success as far as

Article 10 - gun stocks take a huge hit after donald trump's surprise win
justin sullivan/getty images smith & wesson shares fell sharply wednesday following donald trump's presidential victory. donald trump’s surprise win on tuesday brought another (seeming) surprise to the markets on wednesday: gun manufacturers’ stocks fell off a cliff. share prices in sturm, ruger & co., for instance, opened the morning 12 percent lower and then lost yet more ground in morning trading: google finance rival gun manufacturer smith & wesson fared little better, also opening the day down about 12 percent and then trading still lower: google finance but maybe those drops were predictable. aside from the initial panic that trump’s win sparked in the global markets (which has since leveled off), it appears that stock traders ― like many others ― were assuming hillary clinton would win the election. the traders banked on a reactive rush to buy guns as alarms were raised about hypothetical gun control measures under a democratic administration. “ the no. 1 driver of firearms sales is fear ,” brian ruttenbur, an analyst at bb&t capital markets, explained last year. “primarily, fear of registration restrictions, banning and things like that.” with the election of a candidate backed by the national rifle association, that kind of fear is less likely to be whipped up. “the stocks are selling off because donald trump is a solid gun rights supporter and there are no longer worries about new gun control laws that hillary clinton could have pursued,”

Gun Industry Shifts Strategy Amid Growing Scrutiny

In a move aimed at mitigating the risks associated with increased gun control efforts, Sturm, Ruger & Company has instructed its distributors to avoid selling their firearms at gun shows. The company's president and vice chairman, William B. Ruger Jr., stated that the decision is intended to ensure that their products are sold exclusively from regular business locations.

This shift in strategy comes as the gun industry faces mounting pressure from cities and counties seeking to punish manufacturers with lawsuits similar to those used against tobacco companies. As a result, some lawmakers have proposed legislation aimed at reducing demand for guns by adequately financing treatment, rehabilitation, and education programs.

Meanwhile, Connecticut has taken steps to strengthen its gun control laws, with Governor Dannel P. Malloy supporting a ban on high-capacity magazines despite it not being included in the final legislative package. The state's efforts are seen as an attempt to establish itself as a leader in gun safety legislation.

The gun industry's response to these developments has been mixed, with some manufacturers exploring new revenue streams through the sale of branded merchandise and other products. However, others have seen their stocks plummet following Donald Trump's presidential victory, which is expected to reduce fears about new gun control laws.

As the debate over gun control continues, it remains to be seen how the industry will adapt to the changing landscape. With lawmakers on both sides of the aisle pushing for stricter regulations, manufacturers must navigate a complex web of competing interests and priorities

A Growing Concern: The Impact of Ammunition Shortages on Gun Owners

In recent months, gun owners across the country have faced a growing concern: ammunition shortages. Retailers such as Walmart and Hot Shot Sports have imposed limits on how much ammo customers can buy, citing unprecedented demand following high-profile shootings.

The shortage has led to creative solutions among gun enthusiasts. Some are making their own ammo from scratch or re-loading casings from previously shot rounds. This trend is not limited to individual consumers; some manufacturers are also exploring alternative methods to meet the growing demand.

However, lawmakers have taken notice of the issue and are proposing legislation to address it. Representative Tom Rooney has introduced a bill aimed at blocking federal regulations that would restrict certain types of ammunition.

The impact of these shortages extends beyond the gun industry. Some states have ballot initiatives that could affect gun laws, while others have seen a rise in anti-gun sentiment among politicians.

As the debate over gun control continues, it's clear that ammunition shortages are having a significant impact on gun owners and the broader community. With tensions running high, it's essential to consider the long-term effects of these shortages and the potential consequences for Second Amendment rights.

In some areas, retailers have reported widespread disregard for certain laws, leading to concerns about the erosion of societal norms. Meanwhile, government agencies are taking steps to regulate ammunition production, citing environmental concerns.

As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the impact of ammunition shortages on gun owners and the broader community

Firstly, the claim about an infant Jesus on the face of the moon is not supported by any scientific evidence or credible sources. Additionally, the mention of ""ley lines"" and ""mystical energy"" suggests a pseudoscientific approach to understanding ancient trade routes and sacred sites. The article's focus on sensational and unverifiable claims also raises suspicions about its authenticity. In contrast, the Reliable News Article provides factual information about exhibitions, events, and artworks, which is consistent with established news sources.","Mysterious Lunar Sightings and Ancient Secrets Revealed

In recent weeks, a series of extraordinary events has captivated the world's attention. Reports of an infant Jesus on the face of the moon have sparked widespread panic and fascination, with many believing it to be a portent of an impending apocalypse.

However, not all experts are convinced by these claims. Some argue that the image is nothing more than a trick of the light, exacerbated by heavy winter smog in some regions. Nevertheless, the sheer number of eyewitness accounts from across India suggests that something extraordinary was indeed seen.

Meanwhile, researchers have been studying ancient trade routes and alleged alignments of sacred sites, known as ley lines. These supposed pathways are believed to be filled with mystical energy, attracting both curious onlookers and those seeking spiritual enlightenment.

In a separate development, astronomers have been abuzz about the possibility of capturing images of celestial bodies through advanced telescopes. One recent example features a stunning composite image of the Milky Way, created by combining footage from different locations.

However, not all secrets are revealed so easily. A lunar crater has been found to hold many mysteries, including its age. High-resolution imagery has allowed scientists to study the crater in unprecedented detail, revealing new insights into the moon's geological history.

As we continue to explore and understand our universe, it becomes increasingly clear that there is still much to be discovered. Whether it's ancient secrets on the moon or the mysteries of the cosmos itself, humanity remains driven to uncover the truth.","A Year of Reflection and Exploration

As the world marks a year of milestones, several exhibitions and events are taking center stage. One such event is a retrospective of a renowned still-life painter, whose works focus on the beauty of everyday objects. The exhibition, which runs through September 3rd, features precise observations that make a compelling record of the value of seeing.

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, two retrospectives of a celebrated photographer are on display. The exhibitions showcase his work, including portraits of famous individuals and erotic photographs, highlighting the artist's provocative style. A new documentary about the photographer has also been released, further cementing his legacy.

In New York City, a solo exhibition by an emerging artist explores themes of dreams and nightmares. The show features works created in collaboration with local artisans from Burkina Faso, who incorporated their own interpretations of the moon into their art. While some critics have praised the work, others have questioned its artistic merit.

Across town, a party was held at the American Museum of Natural History to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. The event featured over 400 guests, including astronauts and celebrities. A separate exhibition in Southampton honored Dorothy Lichtenstein, a museum trustee and widow of artist Roy Lichtenstein.

ley lines : a harmonic grid of energy (before it's news) ley lines are alleged alignments of ancient sites or holy places, such as stone circles, standing stones, cairns, and churches. interest in ley lines began with the publication in 1922 of early britishtrackways by alfred watkins (1855-1935), a self-taught amateur archaeologist and antiquarian. based upon the fact that on a map of blackwardine, near leominster, england, he could link a number of ancient landmarks by a series of straight lines, he became convinced that he had discovered an ancient trade route. interest in these alleged trade routes as sources of mystical energy has become very popular among new agers in great britain. today, ley lines have been adopted by new age occultists everywhere as sources of power or energy, attracting not only curious new agers but aliens in their ufos and locals with their dowsing rods. these new age occultists believe that there are certain sites on the earth which are filled with special “energy.” stonehenge, mt. everest, ayers rock in australia, nazca in peru, the great pyramid at giza, sedona (arizona), mutiny bay, among other places, are believed to be places of special energy. there is no evidence for this belief save the usual subjective certainty based on uncontrolled observations by untutored devotees. nevertheless, advocates claim that the alleged energy

Article 2 - art guide
* chardin, metropolitan museum of art, fifth avenue at 82nd street, (212) 535-7710 (through sept. 3). this retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about jean-simeon chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. the art, by contrast with so much rococo art, is about love, not sex. quiet and deliberation were chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. he was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. the result was a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art. hours and admission: see above (michael kimmelman). ''dancing demons: ceremonial masks of mongolia,'' asia society at midtown, 502 park avenue, at 59th street, (212) 288-6400 (through sept. 17). the religious art of mongolia is a hybrid of shamanism and buddhism. it takes a particularly dynamic form in fantastic sculptural masks made to be worn in epic-scale religious dramas that were part morality play, part circus and part public exorcism. several of those masks -- vividly painted, larger than life -- are in this show.

Article 3 - the look of life
the frenzy that usually erupts when a new iphone hits stores — wild anticipation, long lines, jacked-up resale prices — was more than matched 75 years ago in the exuberant public reaction to the launching of an innovative (how quaint it sounds today) print magazine. when the first issue of life appeared on nov. 23, 1936, the 200,000 newsstand copies sold out within 24 hours, leaving disappointed customers and vendors clamoring for more. defying expectations in the midst of the depression, the magazine’s circulation rapidly soared to nearly two million readers. in his definitive biography, “the publisher: henry luce and his american century,” alan brinkley vividly describes how luce was inspired to create this glossy photography publication. (the idea and title had been suggested by his future wife, clare boothe, among others.) life depicted an upbeat can-do vision of america, so much so that brinkley says the magazine’s sensibility of “amiable positiveness” was reflected in idyllic and picturesque photos of even the poor and downtrodden. with a mandate to educate and entertain a mass audience, the magazine subsequently became renowned for its influential war coverage, chronicling the horrors of world war ii and the heartbreak of vietnam, and glamorous shots of movie stars at work and play. now comes “75 years: the very best of life,” a coffee-table behemoth weighing nearly seven pounds, featuring unforgettable photo­graphs

''now, where is your hotel located, sir?'' the driver asked, his hand poised over the controls. i told him. he punched in the address and immediately the p.l.d. took over, instructing him -- in a crisply authoritative feminine voice -- which way to turn, even here in the complex labyrinth of the airport exits. impressive -- as was its helpful habit of telling him which way to turn a good hundred meters before a decision had to be made. the p.l.d. had obviously cost the driver a good deal of hard-earned money, and he spent the drive bragging about its usefulness, its infallibility. i was convinced myself. i told my kids how london drivers of black cabs (which this cab was not), in order to be licensed had to pass a difficult geography test after studying the layout of the city's streets for two years, but that electronic devices like these would perhaps make that sort of hard-won street smarts a thing of the past. maybe -- or maybe not. for the p.l.d., which performed so flawlessly on the beginning of our ride in, ran into trouble once we got east of piccadilly circus and the streets became narrower and more complex. the intervals between instructions became longer; the voice, as authoritative as ever, kept taking us the wrong way down one-way streets. we were in soho now, and walking the streets were some, uh, interesting characters; my kids had gone from nervous

Article 5 - inconstant moon? no problem
photo to say i am not an avid outdoorsman is a gross understatement. from my perspective, civilization as we know it dates to the invention of air-conditioning, and the whole point of living in new york city is the opportunity it affords to bypass nature completely and its many discomforts and outright perils. so you might conclude that shakespeare in the park, the beloved summer institution created by joseph papp and going strong some 50 years later, would have me grumbling about bugs, heat, rain and a paranoid fear of falling tree limbs. (not so paranoid, that, which is why i remain immune to the vaunted charms of central park.) i’ll cop to some resistance born of unhappy experiences, like the insufferably muggy night that i sweltered through “the skin of our teeth,” and a performance of “the merchant of venice” that stretched until midnight after the skies opened midway through the first act, necessitating a 45-minute pause during which the audience huddled under the theater’s narrow eaves. but i have come to appreciate — even look forward to — the undeniable pleasures of the experience, particularly in recent years, as the public theater has raised its shakespeare productions to a generally high standard. the comedies in which natural realms are benign, healing influences play particularly well outdoors. having a real forest (or what can pass for one) portray the role of the forest of arden in “as you like it” sweet

Article 6 - raf simons salutes robert mapplethorpe, a fellow provocateur
the new collection was made in collaboration with the robert mapplethorpe foundation, which reached out to him to explore a partnership two months ago. “usually it’s the other way around,” mr. simons said. “i said, ‘can we start tomorrow?’ ” photo it is a year of mapplethorpe, as well as a year of raf. twin retrospectives of mapplethorpe’s work are on view, following major mapplethorpe foundation gifts, at the los angeles county museum of art and at the getty center in los angeles, one of mr. simons’s favorite cities; and a new documentary, “mapplethorpe: look at the pictures,” aired on hbo earlier this year. so mr. simons shelved some early plans and set about incorporating mapplethorpe’s photography into his collection: the celebrity portraits as well as the self-portraits, the erotic photos as well as the flowers. much of the initial goggling and giggling was over the explicitly erotic pieces, but the show had the scope of a complete catalog. many of the most famous photos were here: portraits of patti smith, debbie harry, robert sherman and alice neel; mapplethorpe’s leather-gloved hand from the invitation to a major exhibition; the flowers; the classical statuary. it had been an undertaking, mr. simons said, to reach out

Article 7 - art in review; marco boggio sella
dreams and nightmares of the african astronauts john connelly presents 625 west 27th street, chelsea through june 17 marco boggio sella doesn't do things by halves. his solo debut at this gallery was a nightmarish environment based on matisse's ''red studio.'' ''dreams and nightmares of the african astronauts'' is a primitivist salon that opens a pandora's box of artistic and ethical issues. it all began when mr. boggio sella visited an impoverished village in burkina faso, bringing books on astronomy and photographs of the 1969 moon landing. the latter was news to many of the villagers. he then collaborated with local batik makers, mud-cloth painters and woodcarvers to incorporate their new notion of the moon and the cosmos into their work. in addition to plastering the walls with the results of this effort, he has arranged tourist masks and other objects, some of which he made, in large ethnographic vitrines. in videos, the villagers discuss the moon landing, sometimes wondering if the money might have been better spent on earth, and a local man seems to spend a day in a reasonable facsimile of an astronaut's suit. this is a lot to sort through. bottom line? the works that mr. boggio sella made with the villagers are a lot livelier than the few examples of his own efforts included here. perhaps he should always collaborate with disadvantaged but

Mysterious Lunar Sightings and Ancient Secrets Revealed

In recent weeks, a series of extraordinary events has captivated the world's attention. Reports of an infant Jesus on the face of the moon have sparked widespread panic and fascination, with many believing it to be a portent of an impending apocalypse.

However, not all experts are convinced by these claims. Some argue that the image is nothing more than a trick of the light, exacerbated by heavy winter smog in some regions. Nevertheless, the sheer number of eyewitness accounts from across India suggests that something extraordinary was indeed seen.

Meanwhile, researchers have been studying ancient trade routes and alleged alignments of sacred sites, known as ley lines. These supposed pathways are believed to be filled with mystical energy, attracting both curious onlookers and those seeking spiritual enlightenment.

In a separate development, astronomers have been abuzz about the possibility of capturing images of celestial bodies through advanced telescopes. One recent example features a stunning composite image of the Milky Way, created by combining footage from different locations.

However, not all secrets are revealed so easily. A lunar crater has been found to hold many mysteries, including its age. High-resolution imagery has allowed scientists to study the crater in unprecedented detail, revealing new insights into the moon's geological history.

As we continue to explore and understand our universe, it becomes increasingly clear that there is still much to be discovered. Whether it's ancient secrets on the moon or the mysteries of the cosmos itself, humanity remains driven to uncover the truth

A Year of Reflection and Exploration

As the world marks a year of milestones, several exhibitions and events are taking center stage. One such event is a retrospective of a renowned still-life painter, whose works focus on the beauty of everyday objects. The exhibition, which runs through September 3rd, features precise observations that make a compelling record of the value of seeing.

Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, two retrospectives of a celebrated photographer are on display. The exhibitions showcase his work, including portraits of famous individuals and erotic photographs, highlighting the artist's provocative style. A new documentary about the photographer has also been released, further cementing his legacy.

In New York City, a solo exhibition by an emerging artist explores themes of dreams and nightmares. The show features works created in collaboration with local artisans from Burkina Faso, who incorporated their own interpretations of the moon into their art. While some critics have praised the work, others have questioned its artistic merit.

Across town, a party was held at the American Museum of Natural History to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. The event featured over 400 guests, including astronauts and celebrities. A separate exhibition in Southampton honored Dorothy Lichtenstein, a museum trustee and widow of artist Roy Lichtenstein.

As we reflect on the past year, it's clear that art, science, and exploration continue to captivate us. Whether through photography, painting, or astronomy, these pursuits inspire us to see the world in new and

In a world where cars are not just modes of transportation, but status symbols and works of art, there exist some truly rare and exotic vehicles that can make even the most seasoned car enthusiast weak in the knees. One such vehicle is the 1954 model that could have potentially ""killed"" the Corvette, a car so coveted that it recently sold for an astonishing $3,240,000.

For those who love cars almost as much as they love life, there's no better way to experience the thrill of driving than with a high-performance vehicle. And what better way to experience that thrill than with a rally racing car? Ken Block, a renowned driver and entrepreneur, has been known to push his vehicles to the limit, but even he acknowledges that money can't buy skill.

For some, however, cars are more than just a hobby - they're a passion that's passed down from generation to generation. A retired Marine Colonel, who spent years flying Harrier jets, has recently purchased several vintage models and is now on the hunt for more. His love of cars is not only a personal passion but also a way to connect with his past.

Meanwhile, in the world of commercial vehicles, Ram Trucks has just announced its latest addition: the Promaster City, a small van that's set to compete with other popular models on the market. With its sleek design and advanced features, this new van is sure to be a hit among business owners and enthusiasts alike.

And then there are those who have lost their way - literally. A man from Frankfurt, Germany, parked his car in 1997 but couldn't remember where he put it. Twenty years later, he's finally reunited with the vehicle, a remarkable story that highlights the power of perseverance and determination.

For some, cars are more than just machines - they're works of art that can bring people together. A father who loves cars has been taking his kids to car shows and working on their own vehicles, inspiring them to develop a passion for the hobby. And then there's Fireball Tim, a thought leader who inspires greatness with his words about the power of vehicles as metaphors.

These are just a few examples of the rare and exotic vehicles that exist in our world. Whether you're a seasoned car enthusiast or just starting out, there's no denying the thrill and excitement that comes with driving one of these incredible machines.","A Life of Passion and Purpose: The Automotive Industry's Unsung Heroes

Meet Chip Miller, a 57-year-old car enthusiast who has spent his life collecting vintage Corvettes. With over 40 cars in his collection, Miller is a testament to the enduring passion for automotive culture. His journey began at a young age, when he discovered a tiny car magazine in the gutter and became hooked on the world of cars.

Miller's story is not unique, however. Many individuals in the industry have dedicated their lives to creating, engineering, and marketing vehicles that bring joy to millions. From the designers who craft sleek lines and innovative features to the engineers who push the boundaries of performance and efficiency, these individuals are the backbone of the automotive industry.

But it's not just about the cars themselves; it's also about the people behind them. Take, for example, Akio Toyoda, the CEO of Toyota, who has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a major recall and growing concerns over safety issues. Despite these setbacks, Toyoda remains committed to his vision of creating safe and reliable vehicles.

In other news, General Motors has asked aviation regulators to block the public's ability to track one of its planes, citing concerns over corporate jet usage. This move comes as lawmakers have criticized GM for using private jets to plead their case for a $25 billion rescue plan.

Meanwhile, in Romania, ARO is pushing to sell its Romanian-made SUV at a lower price point, making it more accessible to drivers who crave a rugged, military-style vehicle. The company's CEO, Mr. Perez, believes that this move will help the brand gain traction in the market.

As we look to the future of the automotive industry, it's clear that there are many unsung heroes working behind the scenes to create innovative vehicles and experiences for consumers. From the designers who craft iconic cars to the engineers who push the boundaries of technology, these individuals are the driving force behind the industry's success.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

at 57, he has been wiping greasy hands on overalls since junior high school. he owns 40 vintage corvettes. ''i have insane amounts of garage space,'' he said. ''i was in the car culture when it was really happening,'' added mr. miller, who, with his partner, bill miller (no relation), owns the carlisle, pa., fairgrounds, home to two big car meets, spring carlisle and fall carlisle. ''i was 13 1/2 years old, and i had a one-mile walk home from school,'' he said. ''i found this tiny car magazine in the gutter, about half the size of a regular magazine. i must have read that thing 10 times. i didn't know anything about cars. my parents hated cars except to drive them. my dad would never check the oil. he'd wait for steam to come out before checking the water level in the radiator.'' at 15, a year before he could get a driver's license, chip miller bought his first car, a 1951 ford coupe. price: $100. it needed work. while his classmates at jenkintown high school, near philadelphia, were playing baseball, he was scouring junkyards for transmission bolts. one car led to another, even as life intervened. he graduated from the two-year engineering program at the state university of new york at farmingdale. he married. he

Article 2 - life after a merger: learning on both sides
so what, exactly, is the best way to persuade members of the new corporate family to stay? the sensible approach is the simplest: plan ahead, communicate often and treat everyone involved in the deal with respect. say clearly and early when any cuts will occur, and help people feel that they are a part of the combined company’s culture. timothy j. galpin, a senior fellow at katzenbach partners and author of “the complete guide to mergers and acquisitions,” uses the term “re-recruiting” to describe what managers need to do after a deal. a manager must find out whether a committee assignment, a new title, a role in the transition or some other inducement might make a difference in keeping an employee. (retention bonuses are tricky. if they are not tied to performance, mr. galpin said, an employee may just spend several months landing the perfect job elsewhere.) re-recruitment comes up most often in rapidly changing industries like technology and health care, where employees with specific skills can be particularly valuable. but not all skills are technical: it is crucial to identify the employees who form the core of the company’s social network, mr. galpin said, because they can help persuade valuable employees to stay. it is also important not to forget people in the acquiring company who may feel shunted aside. “you have to look at your own people and say, ‘who do i need to worry about on my current team?’ ” he said.

Article 4 - toyota’s top executive under rising pressure
nagoya, japan  when akio toyoda took control last summer of the company started by his grandfather, his challenge was to lead toyota out of its worst financial crisis in half a century. that, it turned out, was the easy part. since last fall, mr. toyoda and his top united states executives have been struggling to find the words to calm consumers about the safety of toyota’s cars, and it is proving to be a far more difficult task than fixing the company’s finances. after the first big recall of toyota vehicles last fall, mr. toyoda said publicly that the company was a step away from “capitulation to irrelevance or death.” the company, he added, was “grasping for salvation.” he briefly apologized last week while at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland. and with concerns growing about safety issues in more models, he apologized again friday at a hastily arranged news conference, where he said toyota would establish a high-level committee to study the problems. “i came out here today because i would not want our customers to spend the weekend wondering whether their cars are safe,” he said. but his statements are unlikely to quell the mounting concerns of toyota owners, as well as american government officials. a house committee will hold a hearing on toyota safety in washington next week, when the company will again be pressed publicly about its handling of safety issues. the company has recalled about nine million cars worldwide

Article 5 - trader with north koreans accuses ex-state dept. aide
according to people familiar with the inquiry, mr. chang told investigators that he had wanted help from dr. quinones, who retired in 1998, to recover $71 million he said he was owed by north korea for grain shipments he had brokered. dr. quinones also served on a united states mission to north korea that hired a company owned by mr. chang to provide the mission with transportation and supplies there. mr. chang said his gifts included a new 1994 acura legend for dr. quinones's wife and more than $50,000 for the couple's younger daughter, who enrolled at stanford university in 1995. mr. chang said he also gave the couple's elder daughter a job at a hotel in fort lee, n.j., that he owned, and supplemented her salary when dr. quinones complained it was insufficient, these sources said. if true, mr. chang's account adds another chapter to the remarkable story of his attempts to buy influence in washington. having opened the capital's doors in the early 1990's with little more than a checkbook, mr. chang was invited repeatedly to the white house and was able to befriend powerful politicians. but mr. chang's credibility has not gone unchallenged. before he pleaded guilty last year to the campaign-finance violations, the prosecutors had charged mr. chang, 57, with falsifying documents and trying to get witnesses to commit perjury.

Article 7 - trump on twitter: ford won't move lincoln assembly to mexico
detroit (ap) — president-elect donald trump took to twitter thursday night to announce that ford motor co. won't be moving lincoln production from kentucky to mexico. bill ford , the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a lincoln plant would stay in louisville, trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. ford doesn't have a plant that exclusively builds lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the lincoln mkc small suv out of the louisville assembly plant so it could make more ford escapes there. a company spokeswoman confirmed thursday that ford was considering mkc production at a factory in cuautitlan, mexico. the move was negotiated with the united auto workers union in 2015. company spokeswoman christin baker said she didn't know when the decision was made to keep the mkc in louisville or if trump had any impact on it. it's possible the decision was made before the election, because escape sales have been falling since july, so additional production capacity in louisville may not be needed. ""we are encouraged that president-elect trump and the new congress will pursue policies that will improve u.s. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the united states,"" baker said in an e-mail. the development is the latest in a yearlong feud between trump and ford over plans to move production south of the border. the company plans to shift small

A Life of Passion and Purpose: The Automotive Industry's Unsung Heroes

Meet Chip Miller, a 57-year-old car enthusiast who has spent his life collecting vintage Corvettes. With over 40 cars in his collection, Miller is a testament to the enduring passion for automotive culture. His journey began at a young age, when he discovered a tiny car magazine in the gutter and became hooked on the world of cars.

Miller's story is not unique, however. Many individuals in the industry have dedicated their lives to creating, engineering, and marketing vehicles that bring joy to millions. From the designers who craft sleek lines and innovative features to the engineers who push the boundaries of performance and efficiency, these individuals are the backbone of the automotive industry.

But it's not just about the cars themselves; it's also about the people behind them. Take, for example, Akio Toyoda, the CEO of Toyota, who has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a major recall and growing concerns over safety issues. Despite these setbacks, Toyoda remains committed to his vision of creating safe and reliable vehicles.

In other news, General Motors has asked aviation regulators to block the public's ability to track one of its planes, citing concerns over corporate jet usage. This move comes as lawmakers have criticized GM for using private jets to plead their case for a $25 billion rescue plan.

""Rare and Exotic: A Look at the World's Most Coveted Vehicles""

In a world where cars are not just modes of transportation, but status symbols and works of art, there exist some truly rare and exotic vehicles that can make even the most seasoned car enthusiast weak in the knees. One such vehicle is the 1954 model that could have potentially ""killed"" the Corvette, a car so coveted that it recently sold for an astonishing $3,240,000.

For those who love cars almost as much as they love life, there's no better way to experience the thrill of driving than with a high-performance vehicle. And what better way to experience that thrill than with a rally racing car? Ken Block, a renowned driver and entrepreneur, has been known to push his vehicles to the limit, but even he acknowledges that money can't buy skill.

For some, however, cars are more than just a hobby - they're a passion that's passed down from generation to generation. A retired Marine Colonel, who spent years flying Harrier jets, has recently purchased several vintage models and is now on the hunt for more. His love of cars is not only a personal passion but also a way to connect with his past.

Meanwhile, in the world of commercial vehicles, Ram Trucks has just announced its latest addition: the Promaster City, a small van that's set to compete with other popular models on the market. With its sleek design and advanced features, this new van is sure

As the conflict in Syria continues to escalate, Western powers are facing increasing pressure to take action. The situation has become increasingly complex, with multiple factions vying for control and various countries providing support to different sides.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that his country will not support a military strike against Syria unless conclusive evidence of chemical weapons use is presented. This stance has been met with skepticism by Western leaders, who point out that the intelligence on the matter is inconclusive.

Meanwhile, US officials have accused Russia of supporting the Syrian government, which Moscow denies. The situation has become so tense that senior sources within the Syrian military claim that special operations teams are pre-positioned in the United States to conduct sabotage operations in case of a military aggression against Syria.

The conflict has also raised concerns about the potential for escalation and the impact on global stability. French officials have revealed that they were aware of plans to attack Syria as early as 2009, citing anti-Israeli sentiment as the motivation.

As tensions continue to rise, Western leaders are under pressure to take a firm stance against Russia's support for the Syrian government. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has taken a hard line against Russia, calling it ""incompetent"" for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the US has not presented conclusive evidence of chemical attacks in Syria, despite accusations from officials such as Vice President Joe Biden. The real motive behind the aggression appears to be Syria's energy resources.

As the conflict continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Western powers will respond to the situation and what consequences this may have for global stability.","Syria's Chemical Arsenal: A Double-Edged Sword

As the world watches, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has been negotiating with Russia to dismantle his chemical arsenal. The deal, brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian President Vladimir Putin, aims to curb the use and proliferation of chemical weapons worldwide.

However, experts warn that this move may be a calculated attempt to deter foreign intervention. ""The thing about WMDs is that they are useless unless the other side knows you have them,"" says Joseph Holliday, an Iraq War veteran who tracks the opposition Free Syrian Army.

Meanwhile, in Washington, President Barack Obama has been trying to balance his commitment to democracy with the need for a peaceful resolution. His administration's stance on Syria has been met with skepticism by some, including neoconservative think tanks, which prefer a more aggressive approach.

The situation is further complicated by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Iran, where Russia has been accused of supporting separatist groups. US Secretary of State Kerry's visit to Moscow last week aimed to improve relations between the two countries.

As the world waits with bated breath for Syria's chemical arsenal to be dismantled, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and the consequences of failure could be catastrophic.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - putin: i won’t support strike unless i see assad using chemical weapons while holding two forms of i.d.
moscow — with western pressure on the assad regime mounting, the kremlin is still resolute in its opposition to a military strike in syria. russian president vladimir putin remains insistent that intelligence provided by the u.s. which suggests that assad used chemical weapons on his own people is inconclusive, but has described the kind of evidence he would need in order to back a strike. “until i see syrian president bashar al-assad with chemical weapons in one hand and a clearly visible drivers license and passport in the other hand, there is really no way to know if his regime actually gassed anyone,” the russian president said “all this u.s. data as far as i’m concerned is mere speculation.” the russian president, a noted c.s.i. fan, also said that chemical weapons found lathered in the syrian presidents semen and fingerprints would suffice, but, barring such “smoking gun” evidence, he would have to refrain from approving military action in syria. while many western observers believe that putin is merely protecting a regime friendly to russia, , the former kgb agent disagrees. “look, i’m not an unreasonable man,” putin clarified, “if conclusive evidence does prove assad massacred his civilians with w.m.d’s i would consider using a military strike. i just don’t know how conclusive evidence exists without bodily emissions or photo i.d. being present at a crime scene.” russia said that it would

Article 2 - good point well argued
good point well argued (before it's news) ** for many months the civil war in syria has raged. this blog has barely mentioned it because it was remote and none of our business. there was certainly no strategic interest for the uk in involving itself in that vicious religious conflict. so we make no apology for our saturation focus on syria in recent days, which has been forced on us by the desire of our ‘servants’ to insert themselves directly into the war on the side of the rebels, despite the overwhelming opposition of the general public. we have no idea if the photo below is of a genuine chief petty officer of the us navy, or if it’s just someone playing dress up. but members of the armed forces both in the us and the uk could be forgiven for feeling such a sentiment (via @newsninja2012). it’s a good point, well argued. meanwhile, back in the political bubble, pressure is already building for putting last week’s motion before the house of commons again, eu style. it seems until the lobby fodder votes ‘the right way’ cameron and hague are not going to let this go. it’s a reputational and authority affirmation matter now. and it seems no politician’s legacy is complete without a little war with their name beside it noted for all time in the history books. it seems the apparent reason for resurrecting this obscene rush to visit violence on the syrian regime, to the benefit of al qaeda and

Article 3 - obama would've been better off not giving the syria speech
obama would've been better off not giving the syria speech (before it's news) despite taking his case for intervention in syria directly to the american people on tuesday night, president barack obama has been unable to sway their elected representatives in washington. votes continue to pile up against a potential authorization of force should a diplomatic solution fail, largely because of the confused, contradictory case the white house continues to present. president obama insisted that intervention against syria was in our nation interest, even though he once again said that bashar al-assad’s regime didn’t represent a threat to the united states. he all but said that assad’s government used chemical weapons against its own people, even though the obama administration can’t prove who ordered the attack. and while he claimed that strikes would be a deterrent against future use of chemical weapons, president obama didn’t present any plan for what happens should the situation in syria escalate. the speech was basically a glorified summary of everything that has been said since the end of august, with the added detail that there may now be a diplomatic solution. writing earlier this week at the washington post, chris cillizza wondered whether president obama should have just canceled the speech given that the situation had evolved, thanks to a diplomatic solution presented by russia: by the time tuesday afternoon rolled around, it had become quite clear that events had outrun obama’s plan. congressional opposition to obama’s use-of-force

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by prof. francis boyle it is a fact that since 9-11-2001, the us government has been in the business of destroying countries and using nato as it principle instrument. that was stated more than a decade ago by then us deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz and later by general wesley clark. the pentagon drew up a list of 7 states that were to be destroyed: afghanistan, iran, iraq, lebanon, libya, somalia, sudan and syria and they have systematically proceeded to destroy all of the countries on the list. the strategy in ukraine is the same, us/nato/eu are promoting the destabilization and the breakup of ukraine in order to achieve the nato goal of moving into ukrainian territory closer to russia. harvard professor francis boyle, a us based russian expert who was invited to the soviet union to lecture spoke on these issues and more in an interview with the voice of russia. while russia was distracted into believing that the us wanted a reset us foreign policy was being planned and dictated by rabid russia haters like zbignew brzezinski and richard pipes. brzezinski wants to breakup russia into approximately 68 parts and has placed his protégés in key us foreign policy posts. according to mr. boyle

Article 9 - french people knew about plan to attack syria in 2009! (video)
french people knew about plan to attack syria in 2009! (video) % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the french television watcher knew in 2009 about the plan to attack syria because one of their officials announced it on air. france’s former foreign minister roland dumas stated two years ago in a televised program on lcp that uk government officials had told him about preparations for war in syria before 2011 protests and conflict began. the stated reason for war on syria at that time? (hint: it had nothing to do with chemical weapons.) the explanation for the plan to attack syria was its government’s anti-israel stance and that made it a target for forced regime change western-style, according to dumas. the obama administration said it would take action against the syrian government even without the backing of allies or the united nations. the u.s. has not presented proof that assad’s government used deadly chemical weapons near damascus last week, but that does not really matter, since the real motive for the aggression is syria’s energy resources. u.s. officials, including vice president joe biden, have pointed a finger squarely at assad for the chemical attacks. that is despite there being no completed investigation. citizen reporters know better, such as the young woman who made the video below with evidence of chemicals’ country of origin being the unied states. this was

Article 10 - a loser’s malice: what’s behind obama’s attacks on putin
a loser’s malice: what’s behind obama’s attacks on putin (before it's news) by michael jabara carley / strategic-culture.org relations between russian president vladimir putin and us president barack obama are poisoned and irretrievably damaged. it’s therefore a good thing that obama is leaving office on 20 january. bad us-russian relations are of course nothing new. since the anglo-american war against iraq in 2003, the us-russian relationship has been headed downhill. for obama, it appears that everything has gotten personal. the us president often acts like a petulant adolescent, jealous of a high school rival. you know, the kid who does everything better than he does. the lad takes it badly and won’t let it go. he challenges his nemesis to some new contest at every opportunity only to lose again and again. that’s got to be hard on the ego. between obama and putin there have been many such encounters. nor can it help that western cartoonists so often ridicule obama as out of his depth in comparison to putin. let’s consider obama’s remarks at his last press conference on friday, 16 december. «the russians can’t change us or significantly weaken us», said obama: «they are a smaller country. they are a weaker country. their economy doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy, except oil and gas and arms.

Article 1 - syria threatens chemical attack on foreign force
asked whether syria was finally acknowledging that it had chemical weapons, mr. makdissi repeated roughly the same response, but began it by saying that any stock of unconventional weapons or chemical weapons “if they exist” would not be used domestically, but would be used against foreign intervention. photo but the attempt at verbal sleight of hand did little to conceal what appeared to be syria’s intent, experts and western diplomats said. “look, any talk about any use of any kind of a weapon like that in this situation is horrific and chilling,” said victoria nuland, a state department spokeswoman. “the syrian regime has a responsibility to the world, has a responsibility first and foremost to its own citizens to protect and safeguard those weapons. and that kind of loose talk just speaks to the kind of regime that we’re talking about.” for outside experts, any remarks about chemical weapons meant that syria calculated the value of reminding anyone weighing any direct military intervention just what it could hit them with. “the thing about w.m.d. is that they are useless unless the other side knows you have them,” said joseph holliday, an iraq war veteran who tracks the opposition free syrian army for the institute for the study of war in washington. “so despite the fact that the regime has not been open about its weapons program, it has to make it clear to neighbors that it has the capability, so it has to be relatively public.” analysts dismissed the idea

Article 3 - neocons object to syrian democracy
exclusive: president obama has infuriated official washington’s neocons by accepting the russian stance that the syrian people should select their own future leaders through free elections, rather than the neocon insistence on a foreign-imposed “regime change,” reports robert parry. by robert parry the washington post’s editorial board is livid that president barack obama appears to have accepted the russian position that the syrian people should decide for themselves who their future leaders should be when the post seems to prefer that the choice be made by neoconservative think tanks in washington or other outsiders. so, in a furious editorial on friday, the post castigated secretary of state john kerry for saying after a meeting with russian president vladimir putin in moscow that the obama administration and russia see the political solution to syria “in fundamentally the same way,” meaning that syrian president bashar al-assad could stand for election in the future. the post wrote: “unfortunately, that increasingly appears to be the case, and not because mr. putin has altered his position. for four years, president obama demanded the departure of mr. assad, who has killed hundreds of thousands of his own people with chemical weapons, ‘barrel bombs,’ torture and other hideous acts. yet in its zeal to come to terms with mr. putin, the obama administration has been slowly retreating from that position.” the russian position, which obama finally seems to

Article 4 - shocking footage captures screaming syrian child being rescued; 50 other children killed (video)
(screenshot: bbc news) video footage shows syrian child being rescued from the rubble in eastern ghouta in january 2018. footage obtained from eastern ghouta in syria has captured the dramatic rescue of a young child from underneath a large pile of rubble. but at least 50 other children are among the 200 people who have died in the area due to the bombings over the past couple of weeks. a bbc news video, published tuesday, showed people pulling out a 3-year-old boy named mahmoud from the rubble of a building that was taken down in an air strike. although mahmoud survived, his older brother was lost in the rubble, the report said. the video showed another eight civilians being pulled out alive with the help of workers and locals. eastern ghouta is one of the heavily besieged areas finding itself in the crossfire of syria's civil war, with at least 200 people being killed due to air strikes, shelling, and bombardment between government forces and rebels who are trying to take down president bashar al assad. unicef, the u.n.'s agency for children, said last week that as many as 200,000 children have been trapped under siege since 2013, when the civil war intensified.

Article 5 - deal represents turn for syria; rebels deflated
kamel wazne, a lebanese analyst who has close contacts with senior members of hezbollah, the lebanese militia that has sent fighters to aid mr. assad’s forces, said sunday that the deal allowed the side of the syrian government to exhale. “whether the americans like it or not,” he said, “when you negotiate the deal with the russians as representatives of bashar al-assad, you acknowledged his existence and his continuation in power.” though american officials keep saying that their threat of military force remains, mr. wazne added, the syrian government is now reassured that there will be no strikes anytime soon, and that “at least for today, life is normal in damascus.” in washington, president obama portrayed the agreement with russia as a victory on an issue more important to american interests than the outcome of the war in syria: curbing the use and proliferation of chemical weapons around the world. he suggested that the process of carrying out the deal could lay the groundwork for an eventual political settlement between backers and opponents of mr. assad. the widespread perception in the region, though, was that every player had gained something in the past few weeks except the rebels — and, in large part, syrian civilians, who human rights groups say have been systematically attacked by the government, and who have suffered abuses from both sides. mr. wazne listed the winners: mr. obama avoided a potentially embarrassing

Article 6 - russia sides with chemical weapons
russia proved again on tuesday that there is no crime heinous enough to make it turn against syria’s president, bashar al-assad. it vetoed a resolution before the united nations security council that would have punished syria for using chemical weapons. the kremlin’s decision was in keeping with president vladimir putin’s vigorous support of the syrian military in a six-year-long war that has killed half a million people. photo the vote marked the seventh time since 2011 that mr. putin protected mr. assad from international condemnation or sanctions and, as often is the case, china followed russia’s example. although moscow had made clear in advance that it would veto the resolution, britain and france were right to insist on a vote and to expose russia’s moral bankruptcy. the resolution, supported by britain, france and the united states, would have imposed sanctions on some syrian military officials and entities for dropping chlorine-filled barrel bombs on rebel-held areas in 2014 and 2015, according to a united nations panel. the use of chlorine as a weapon is banned under an international treaty that the assad government signed in 2013, as part of the deal struck by the united states and russia to force mr. assad to dismantle his stockpile of the chemical munitions. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from op-ed column

Article 7 - an unlikely evolution, from casual proposal to possible resolution
washington — the afternoon gathering of world leaders was just breaking up in st. petersburg, russia , on friday when president vladimir v. putin walked over to president obama and began chatting casually. mr. obama suggested they sit down, and the two pulled chairs into a corner of the room. they had been at odds over mr. obama’s plans to launch airstrikes against syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on civilians. but now mr. putin brought up an idea. what if syria surrendered its stockpiles of poison gas to the international community? mr. obama suggested that they have their top diplomats explore it further. while the proposal appeared to come out of the blue when russia made it public on monday after a seemingly offhand comment by secretary of state john kerry, it had actually grown out of conversations between mr. obama and mr. putin going back more than a year. but mr. kerry’s remark gave mr. putin the opening to spring the idea on the world, seize control of the syria debate and effectively derail mr. obama’s planned strike. although skeptical of his russian counterpart, mr. obama has now tentatively embraced the proposal as a possible resolution to his confrontation with president bashar al-assad — and at the same time as an escape from a showdown with a congress poised to reject military action. but as washington contemplated the many obstacles to the plan on tuesday,

Article 8 - libya’s cache of toxic arms all destroyed
libya’s last two tons of chemical weapons were dwarfed by the 1,300 tons that syria has agreed to destroy. but american and international arms experts say the need for easily transportable and efficient technology to wipe out the libyan arms became a model for the syria program now underway. for libya’s fragile transitional government, such collaboration with the west on security matters is a delicate issue. it gives the country’s leaders desperately needed assistance to defuse internal threats, but also risks accusations of compromising national sovereignty. asked about the american efforts to destroy the chemical weapons, libyan security officials in tripoli initially issued sweeping denials. one later briefly acknowledged the operation on the condition of anonymity, and then officials stopped returning phone calls. on sunday, the white house said that it would ensure that the syrian government complied with an accord to give up its chemical arsenal despite missed deadlines and delays in carrying out the deal. the white house chief of staff, denis mcdonough, said on the cbs news program “face the nation” that the deal was “not falling apart, but we would like to see it proceed much more quickly than it is.” the disposal of the last of libya’s chemical weapons closes a chapter that colonel qaddafi began in early 2004, when his government turned over a vast cache of nuclear technology and chemical stockpiles to the united states, britain and international nuclear inspectors. at that time, libya declared for destruction

it’s probably no coincidence that one of the targets of navalny’s recent muckraking was the head of the very same investigative committee, aleksandr bastrykin. navalny posted documents showing that bastrykin secretly possessed a residence permit and real estate in the czech republic , raising questions about his faith in russia’s future and, since the czech republic is a member of the nato alliance, his vulnerability to blackmail. the state’s obvious hope is that by convicting navalny on charges of greed, it will diminish his credibility as a corruption-fighter and, not incidentally, head off his political ambitions.

Title: for obama, syria chemical attack shows risk of ‘deals with dictators’
Content: “for me, this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive, invasive and permanent inspection regime,” said michael mcfaul, who was mr. obama’s ambassador to russia. “it also shows the limits of doing deals with putin. surely, the russians must have known about these c.w.” putting the best face on it, former obama advisers said it was better to have removed 1,300 tons of chemical weapons from syria even if mr. assad cheated and kept some, or later developed more. “imagine what syria would look like without that deal,” said antony j. blinken, a former deputy secretary of state. “it would be awash in chemical weapons, which would fall into the hands of isis, al nusra or other groups.” still, the administration knew all along that it had probably not gotten all of the chemical weapons, and tried to get russia to help press syria, without success. “we always knew we had not gotten everything, that the syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration,” mr. blinken said. even before last week’s chemical attack, many veterans of mr. obama’s team considered his handling of syria his biggest failing and expressed regret that their administration did not stop a war that has left more than 400,000 dead and millions displaced. many of them even praised president trump for taking the very action that mr. obama refused to take four years ago, by ordering a cruise missile strike against syria. “donald trump has done the right thing on syria,” anne-marie slaughter, the director of policy planning in mr. obama’s state department, wrote on twitter. “finally!! after years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities.” tom malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for human rights for mr. obama, wrote in the atlantic, “the lesson i would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means, deterrence is more effective than disarmament.” mr. obama grappled with syria for much of his tenure but resisted being directly drawn in, for fear of thrusting america into another middle east quagmire without solving the problem. the most searing moment came in 2013, when mr. assad’s forces killed 1,400 civilians with chemical weapons, brazenly crossing what mr. obama had said would be his “red line.” advertisement continue reading the main story mr. obama prepared a military strike to retaliate, but hesitated amid domestic opposition in both parties and asked congress to decide whether to proceed. when it became clear that congress would not give its approval, he grabbed onto a political lifeline from mr. putin, who proposed a deal in which mr. assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal. newsletter sign up continue

Syria's Chemical Arsenal: A Double-Edged Sword

As the world watches, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has been negotiating with Russia to dismantle his chemical arsenal. The deal, brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian President Vladimir Putin, aims to curb the use and proliferation of chemical weapons worldwide.

However, experts warn that this move may be a calculated attempt to deter foreign intervention. ""The thing about WMDs is that they are useless unless the other side knows you have them,"" says Joseph Holliday, an Iraq War veteran who tracks the opposition Free Syrian Army.

Meanwhile, in Washington, President Barack Obama has been trying to balance his commitment to democracy with the need for a peaceful resolution. His administration's stance on Syria has been met with skepticism by some, including neoconservative think tanks, which prefer a more aggressive approach.

The situation is further complicated by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Iran, where Russia has been accused of supporting separatist groups. US Secretary of State Kerry's visit to Moscow last week aimed to improve relations between the two countries.

As the world waits with bated breath for Syria's chemical arsenal to be dismantled, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and the consequences of failure could be catastrophic.

Western Powers Face Growing Tensions in Syria

As the conflict in Syria continues to escalate, Western powers are facing increasing pressure to take action. The situation has become increasingly complex, with multiple factions vying for control and various countries providing support to different sides.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that his country will not support a military strike against Syria unless conclusive evidence of chemical weapons use is presented. This stance has been met with skepticism by Western leaders, who point out that the intelligence on the matter is inconclusive.

Meanwhile, US officials have accused Russia of supporting the Syrian government, which Moscow denies. The situation has become so tense that senior sources within the Syrian military claim that special operations teams are pre-positioned in the United States to conduct sabotage operations in case of a military aggression against Syria.

The conflict has also raised concerns about the potential for escalation and the impact on global stability. French officials have revealed that they were aware of plans to attack Syria as early as 2009, citing anti-Israeli sentiment as the motivation.

As tensions continue to rise, Western leaders are under pressure to take a firm stance against Russia's support for the Syrian government. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has taken a hard line against Russia, calling it ""incompetent"" for allowing Syria to hold on to chemical weapons.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the US has not presented conclusive evidence of chemical attacks in Syria, despite accusations from officials such as Vice President Joe Biden. The real motive behind the aggression

A sense of unease has settled over the country as reports of violent crime continue to rise. According to recent data, violent crime in the United States increased by 15 percent last year, with property crime rising by 12 percent. The alarming trend has left many wondering if the current economic climate is contributing to the surge.

Meanwhile, a bizarre incident at a Brooklyn IHOP restaurant has sparked debate about the nature of generosity and theft. A waiter, who identified himself as a modern-day Robin Hood, was accused of giving away thousands of dollars in free drinks to customers over eight months. While some see his actions as altruistic, others view them as theft.

In another shocking turn of events, a police officer in San Antonio was fired for allegedly feeding a homeless person feces. The incident highlights the complexities of law enforcement and the need for accountability within the ranks.

As the holiday season approaches, concerns about safety are on the rise. A man crashed his car through a Walmart storefront in California, sparking a violent confrontation with employees and customers. Authorities are still unclear about the motivations behind the attack.

In a bizarre twist, a Canadian minister confirmed that Canada will refuse to accept further cuts in its carbon dioxide output under the Kyoto treaty. The move has sparked concerns about the country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite these challenges, some individuals are finding innovative solutions to social issues. In Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio has implemented a program where prisoners care for stray animals, providing low-cost adoptions and education on animal nutrition and behavior.

As the nation grapples with these complex issues, one thing is clear: the future holds many uncertainties.","Chaos and Destruction Erupt Across the Globe

In a series of shocking incidents, chaos and destruction have erupted across the globe. In one instance, a Walmart employee was trampled to death in a stampede, with four others injured. The investigation revealed that the store lacked adequate security, leaving officials scrambling to identify those responsible.

Meanwhile, in New York City, residents are struggling to come to terms with the changing landscape of their neighborhoods. With new businesses and landmarks popping up seemingly overnight, it's becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint what remains constant.

In Chile, a devastating earthquake has left hundreds dead and over 1.5 million displaced. The aftershocks have caused widespread destruction, with buildings collapsing and cars mangled on streets littered with debris.

In the United States, cities are struggling to recover from a massive blackout that left millions without power. Despite efforts to restore electricity, water remains scarce in some areas, prompting officials to warn residents to boil their water before consumption.

In Manhattan, a small record store has emerged as a symbol of resilience in the face of destruction. The store's owners have worked tirelessly to revamp and reopen, with customers flocking to hear music from local artists.

However, not all is well in Egypt, where protests against the government have turned violent. Tensions between rich and poor have exploded, with looters targeting upscale shopping malls and residents turning on each other.

Article 5 - brooklyn ihop waiter arrested for stealing $$3000 in free drinks, “i take from the rich and give to the poor”
a waiter at a brooklyn ihop sees himself as a folk hero, but his boss says he’s a thief. “i am the modern-day robin hood,” said william powell, 27, after prosecutors accused him of giving away $$3,000-plus in soft drinks to customers over eight months. they charged the self-styled robin hop with felony grand larceny and possession of stolen property. “i am not stealing,” powell told cops. “i am serving the ones in need. i take from the rich and give to the poor. what’s the big deal? i’ve been doing this since i started here.” powell told the daily news on wednesday his sugary magnanimity sprang from a desire to make patrons of the livingston st., fort greene, restaurant merry men and women. “it was me looking out for the community. there are certain people that couldn’t afford the drinks,” he said. “there was no malicious intent. me and the owner weren’t seeing eye-to-eye.” typically, when he saw customers hesitate before buying a drink with their meal, powell wound up comping their beverages. “i kind of told them, ‘this is not supposed to happen, but here you guys go,’ ” he explained. he debunked any notion he was doing it to boost his tips, he said, or else he’d have given away free food. police busted powell on march 2. restaurant owner arkell

Article 6 - and there go the attaboys
and there go the attaboys (before it's news) we all know that cops do a lot of good. and sometimes they do truly human heartfelt things for people. some of these go viral. and when that happens, usually someone here will post it or bring it up in a comment. and that is all to the good, and we think, attaboy! that’s one for the cops. the problem, as we all know, is that just one “oh shit!” wipes slick 100 “attaboys!” and sadly, it looks like that just happened. a police officer with the san antonio police department, matthew luckhurst, was fired for allegedly feeding a homeless person a sandwich containing feces, according to the san antonio express news. the unidentified officer reportedly placed the fecal matter in between two slices of bread and gave it to the homeless person. the blaze officer luckhurst said that the incident never happened; that it was all a joke. but apparently his fellow officers didn’t buy it, and the blue wall of silence failed him. because, according to his police chief, his fellow officers reported him to ia. “the fact that his fellow officers were so disgusted with his actions that they reported him to internal affairs demonstrates that this type of behavior will never be tolerated. the action of this one former officer in no way reflects the actions of all the other good men and women who respectfully serve this community.” mysanantonio oh feces!

Article 7 - [photo] lesson: never double-park at wal-mart or be prepared to face the consequences
people take their shopping very seriously this time of year and one person learned the hard way after double parking in a wal-mart parking lot. bad move buddy. according to the blaze, with many people running out to get their last minute shopping done, parking lots tend to get frustratingly busy a week before christmas. so when someone trying to finish up their christmas shopping arrived at a wal-mart in maine and found a car carelessly taking up two parking spots, they decided to take action. matthew mills of biddeford, maine, posted a picture on facebook of a silver nissan boxed in the parking spots with shopping carts, writing, “this guy got a lesson in parking.”

Article 8 - police: man who crashed car into wal-mart was trying to protest something or other
san jose, calif. — police investigating a march 31 incident in which a man crashed his car through a wal-mart storefront and began attacking people inside say that the suspect, haamid ade zaid, was trying to protest “something or other” by careening into the san jose store. “at this time, it’s unclear why, exactly, mr. zaid was so unhappy with the wal-mart corporation,” said a spokesperson for the california state police. “we do know that this was some sort of protest—but frankly, there are so many things he might have been protesting, it’s hard to narrow it down to just one.” mr. zaid reportedly admitted in interrogations that he was extremely angry with wal-mart when he decided to drive his car into one and mercilessly beat the people inside. but police failed to elicit a single, specific grievance mr. zaid had with the multinational corporation that would explain or justify his actions. “he’s definitely mad at wal-mart,” police said. “but the suspect seems to have been overwhelmed by all of the wal-mart-related issues to protest, and may have short-circuited.” indeed, criticisms of wal-mart are considerable. “maybe he was mad about wal-mart’s practice of paying its workers poverty-level wages,” police said. “or he might have been upset by their dealings with suppliers who use slave labor. or perhaps mr. zaid wanted to throw a spotlight

Article 9 - pepperspraying the future
pepperspraying the future headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! a whiff of pepper spray rising from a suburban big box store, a breathtakingly absurd comment by an american politician, a breathtakingly cynical statement from a canadian minister: three scraps of data sent whirling down the wind unnoticed by most of today’s disinformation society, which are also three clues to the exceptionally unwelcome future the industrial world is making for itself. let’s take them one at a time, in reverse order. on monday, as a new round of climate change talks got under way in durban, canadian environment minister peter kent confirmed earlier media reports that canada will refuse to accept any further cuts in its carbon dioxide output under the kyoto treaty. since canada is one of only two countries on earth that uses more energy per capita than the united states—an impressive feat, really, when you think about it—you might be tempted to believe that there was room for some modest cuts, but that notion is nowhere in kent’s view of the universe. those same media reports claimed that canada was preparing to extract itself from the kyoto treaty altogether; kent dodged that question, but as bob dylan sang a good long time ago, you don’t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing. the week before, in a debate among candidates for the gop’s presidential nomination, newt gingrich responded to a question about oil supplies by insisting

Article 1 - wal-mart employee trampled to death
four other people, including a 28-year-old woman who was described as eight months pregnant, were treated at the hospital for minor injuries. detective lt. michael fleming, who is in charge of the investigation for the nassau police, said the store lacked adequate security. he called the scene “utter chaos” and said the “crowd was out of control.” as for those who had run over the victim, criminal charges were possible, the lieutenant said. “i’ve heard other people call this an accident, but it is not,” he said. “certainly it was a foreseeable act.” but even with videos from the store’s surveillance cameras and the accounts of witnesses, lieutenant fleming and other officials acknowledged that it would be difficult to identify those responsible, let alone to prove culpability. some shoppers who had seen the stampede said they were shocked. one of them, kimberly cribbs of queens, said the crowd had acted like “savages.” shoppers behaved badly even as the store was being cleared, she recalled. “when they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling, ‘i’ve been on line since yesterday morning,’ ” ms. cribbs told the associated press. “they kept shopping.” wal-mart security officials and the police cleared the store, swept up the shattered glass and locked the doors until 1 p.m., when it reopened to a steady stream of calmer shoppers who passed through

Article 4 - 1.5 million displaced after chile quake
rio de janeiro — a strong aftershock struck chile on sunday, a day after a destructive 8.8-magnitude earthquake left hundreds of people dead and a long swath of the country in smoky rubble. the death toll was expected to rise, particularly around concepción, chile's second-largest metropolitan area, which is roughly 70 miles from the quake's center. the aftershock was reported around 8:30 local time sunday morning from the capital of santiago, where it shook buildings, according to reuters. more than 1.5 million people have displaced by the quake, according to local news services that quoted the director of chile's emergency management office. in concepción, which appeared to be especially hard hit, the mayor said sunday morning that 100 people were trapped under the rubble of a building that had collapsed, according to reuters. elsewhere in concepción, cars lay mangled and upended on streets littered with telephone wires and power cables. a new 14-story apartment building fell, while an older, biochemical lab at the university of concepción caught fire. in the nearby port of talcahuano, a giant wave flooded the main square before receding and leaving behind a large fishing boat on the city streets. “it was terrible, terrible,” said adela galaz, a 59-year-old cosmetologist who said glasses and paintings fell to the floor of her 22nd-floor apartment in santiago,

over the past several days, hundreds of thousands of egyptians — from indigent fruit peddlers and doormen to students and engineers, even wealthy landlords — poured into the streets together to denounce president hosni mubarak and battle his omnipresent security police. then, on friday night, the police pulled out of egypt’s major cities abruptly, and tensions between rich and poor exploded. looters from cairo’s vast shantytowns attacked gleaming suburban shopping malls, wild rumors swirled of gunfights at the bridges and gates to the most expensive neighborhoods and some of their residents turned wistful about mr. mubarak and his authoritarian rule. “it is as if a domestic war is declared,” said sarah elayashi, 33, from an apartment in the affluent neighborhood of heliopolis, not far from mr. mubarak’s palace. “and we have nothing to defend ourselves but kitchen knives and mop sticks.” “the protesters are against us,” she added. “we hope president mubarak stays because at least we have national security. i wish we could be like the united states with a democracy, but we cannot. we have to have a ruler with an iron hand.” now some accuse the mubarak government of deliberately fanning class tensions in order to create demands for the restoration of its brutal security state. but such resentments have built up here for nearly a decade outside of public view. “these

Chaos and Destruction Erupt Across the Globe

In a series of shocking incidents, chaos and destruction have erupted across the globe. In one instance, a Walmart employee was trampled to death in a stampede, with four others injured. The investigation revealed that the store lacked adequate security, leaving officials scrambling to identify those responsible.

Meanwhile, in New York City, residents are struggling to come to terms with the changing landscape of their neighborhoods. With new businesses and landmarks popping up seemingly overnight, it's becoming increasingly difficult to pinpoint what remains constant.

In Chile, a devastating earthquake has left hundreds dead and over 1.5 million displaced. The aftershocks have caused widespread destruction, with buildings collapsing and cars mangled on streets littered with debris.

In the United States, cities are struggling to recover from a massive blackout that left millions without power. Despite efforts to restore electricity, water remains scarce in some areas, prompting officials to warn residents to boil their water before consumption.

In Manhattan, a small record store has emerged as a symbol of resilience in the face of destruction. The store's owners have worked tirelessly to revamp and reopen, with customers flocking to hear music from local artists.

However, not all is well in Egypt, where protests against the government have turned violent. Tensions between rich and poor have exploded, with looters targeting upscale shopping malls and residents turning on each other.

The recent decision by President Obama to block the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline has sparked intense debate among lawmakers and industry experts. The proposed pipeline, which would transport oil from Canada to refineries in the US, is seen as a crucial project for boosting economic growth and creating jobs.

However, critics argue that the president's decision is driven by environmental concerns rather than a genuine commitment to job creation and energy independence. Senator Marco Rubio has called the decision ""foolish"" and vowed to work with Congress to reverse it.

Meanwhile, Canada has expressed disappointment at the decision, with Prime Minister Harper stating that he hopes the project will continue despite the setback. The Canadian government is instead exploring alternative routes for its own oil exports, including a proposed pipeline through Western Canada.

The controversy highlights the deep divisions within the US energy sector and the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental concerns. As one industry expert noted, ""the Keystone XL pipeline would not only transport fuel safely but also boost economic activity along the way.""

The decision has also sparked criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with some accusing President Obama of caving to environmental pressure at the expense of American jobs and economic growth.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the Keystone XL pipeline will ultimately be built or if alternative routes for oil exports will become more prominent. One thing is clear: the decision has significant implications for the US energy sector and the economy as a whole.","Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently traveled to China for a week of high-level meetings, accompanied by several cabinet ministers. The trip came amidst controversy surrounding the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was rejected by President Barack Obama earlier this year.

Harper's government has been instructed to refrain from making comments that might be perceived as interfering in the American presidential election. However, the Prime Minister's office has taken a more diplomatic approach, using meetings with foreign leaders like China's to promote Canadian energy exports.

In contrast, the US federal government has announced plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2% annually for the next decade. The move is seen as a step towards addressing climate change, although it may not have a significant impact on the country's overall carbon footprint.

congressmen call obama’s decision on keystone foolish and extreme (before it's news) “it is absolutely irresponsible that the president would block a project such as the keystone xl pipeline – a project that industry experts say would create at least 20,000 american jobs and be essential in helping jumpstart the american economy. this decision today is further evidence that president obama is not serious about setting the conditions for job creation nor working towards our energy independence as it relates to our national security. once again, president obama has shown that his reelection and pandering to his left wing liberal environmental base is more important than securing the future for our nation. the ramifications of this utterly disturbing politically motivated decision will be far and wide. congratulations china.” king: oil will be sent to china if the keystone xl pipeline isn’t built “if we block it, that oil will certainly go to china. it will enrich their economy,” said king. “it will starve ours and it’s clear that the president is pacifying his environmental extremist base and at the cost of american jobs and the vitality of america’s economy. this is a foolish decision on the part of the president. we’re going to have to do all we can in this congress to reverse that decision, but i fear we’ll have to elect a new president before we can actually accomplish that task.” keystone pipeline should move forward by senator marco rubio president obama’s decision not to move forward on the keystone

how is the keystone xl pipeline progressing? (before it's news) four and a half years of studies and five failed votes in the house later, exactly where are we with the keystone xl pipeline? stuck on the us-canadian border where it is likely to remain until mid-2013 despite the headline-grabbing issuance of one of three permits to begin construction in texas for the smaller and much less controversial portion of the pipeline. on 26 june, the us army corps of engineers granted transcanada corp one of three permits required in order to begin construction on the $$2.3 billion southern section of the keystone xl pipeline, which would run from cushing, oklahoma to the gulf of mexico in texas. this first in the permit series covers construction across the wetlands and waterways of texas’ galveston district. transcanada still needs to more permits from tulsa, oklahoma and forth worth, texas, to complete this southern gulf portion of the pipeline extension. tulsa is set to rule on the second permit in a month and a half. this southern section of the extended pipeline will carry 700,000 barrels a day of crude, to start with, to texas refineries from cushing. construction will begin this summer. the southern line, permits pending, could be functional by mid-to-late next year. indeed, obama pledged to speed up the approval process to make this a reality. but these permits are only for

Article 6 - keystone xl is proof obama opposes u.s. economic growth
keystone xl is proof obama opposes u.s. economic growth (before it's news) alan caruba / warning signs it’s taken nearly five years, but americans are finally aware that president obama is opposed to anything that contributes to the economic growth of the nation. along with a democratic controlled senate and its opposition to anything generated by the republican house, obama has saddled the nation with the highest debt in its history and squandered billions on failed alternative energy firms. the most dramatic example is obama’s five-year delay of the implementation of the keystone xl pipeline that would safely transport oil from canada to refineries on the gulf coast. there are approximately 55,000 miles of pipelines in the u.s. with another 30,000 to 40,000 smaller gathering pipelines that feed it to the major ones. in a february 17 u.s. chamber of commerce advertisement in the weekly standard, its president and ceo, thomas j. donahue, wrote that “in the same time that the keystone xl pipeline application has been under review by the obama administration, the hoover dam, the new jersey turnpike, and the empire state building were built—a clear indicator of how cumbersome and political today’s permitting process has become.” donahue pointed out that “the keystone xl pipeline would not only transport fuel safely, but it would boost economic activity along the way. building the pipeline would create more than 42,000

Article 7 - canada flips obama the bird, will sell oil to china
i’m losing count of how many allies the obama administration has alienated. the latest edition to that list are our northern neighbors. just yesterday, president obama indicated he would not approve construction of the keystone pipeline. i’m sure it’s no coincidence that the keystone pipeline would run through all red states, but i digress. cnn reports: in a statement released by harper’s office, the president is quoted as saying that the decision was not a decision based on the “merits of the project” and that transcanada, the company looking to build the pipeline, could reapply for permission after a new route had been developed. the statement went on to say that prime minister harper “…expressed his profound disappointment with the news. he indicated to president obama that he hoped that this project would continue given the significant contribution it would make to jobs and economic growth both in canada and the united states of america.” but crucially, the statement also said that the prime minister reiterated to president obama that canada will continue to work to diversify its energy exports. in fact, in a sign of warming relations, harper is scheduled to make a high-profile trip to china in february. canada is proposing to build a pipeline of its own through western canada that would make oil exports to china faster and cheaper. in recent months, harper has pushed more forcefully for the northern gateway pipeline project to get underway, calling it in the country’s “national interest” as

Article 8 - payroll tax cut deal (with keystone pipeline) set…
the deal, which still needs approval of the full senate and house of representatives, fell far short of president barack obama‘s push for a one-year extension of the tax relief and long-term unemployed benefits to boost the country’s fragile economic recovery. the surprisingly modest accord will likely do nothing to dispel concerns of american voters and investors of deep dysfunction in the u.s. capital. it also creates more uncertainty about washington’s ability to steer the nation through global economic turbulence. partisan rancor has derailed efforts to forge a deficit reduction plan, brought the government to the brink of a shutdown three times this year and led to a downgrade of by standard & poor’s of the united states’ coveted aaa credit rating in august. democrats did not come close to getting the legislation they initially sought, but they put a brave face on the deal they agreed to, saying it gives them another opportunity early next year to fight for a payroll tax cut for wage earners and tax hikes on the wealthy to pay for it — two arguments that play well with democratic voters. it was not clear how friday’s deal would affect obama, but he has faced persistent criticism from his base of liberal-leaning voters for caving in to republican demands on policy issues ranging from tax hikes and spending cuts to environmental protections. “at one minute to midnight and the end of the year the democrats appear to have conceded two significant issues on the payroll tax cut and they got a measly two months extension in return,” david

Article 9 - obama: if you aren’t a future bankruptcy… f-ck off!
(before it's news) guess you have to be failed future solar company… president obama threatened to veto legislation that would expand oil drilling in alaska and offshore reserves and greenlight the keystone xl pipeline construction, after he warned this morning that gas prices will continue to rise. “because this bill jeopardizes safety, weakens environmental and labor protections, and fails to make the investments needed to strengthen the nation’s roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems,” the office of management and budget (omb) said in a statement released this evening, “the president’s senior advisors would recommend that he veto this legislation.” obama has only vetoed two bills so far in his presidency.

Article 10 - the tar sands
the tar sands (before it's news) apologies for the few weeks of silence. moving cities again, combined with the beginning of a new term, meant hardly any writing time! i should be back into a regular routine now, though. enjoy. in the 2008 presidential campaign, barack obama seemed serious about climate change action. he promised an 80% reduction in american greenhouse gas emissions by 2050: a target which, if reached, would go a long way in solving global warming. therefore, when he won the election, citizens concerned about climate change cheered the world over. “we will restore science to its rightful place,” obama said following his inauguration. “we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories…all this we can do. and all this we will do.” this cheery picture of a renewable energy economy is about as far away as one can get from the energy source obama is now considering supporting: tar sands. concentrated in western canada, the tar sands are an unconventional, and very dirty, form of oil. they produce more carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy than regular petroleum – in fact, if you take transport and refinery into account, they’re slightly worse than coal. if we aggressively develop the tar sands, we will have no hope of stabilizing climate change at a reasonable level. the problems don’t end there. extraction and refinement takes over an incredible amount of land that would otherwise

Article 1 - poisoned politics of keystone xl
on monday, stephen harper , the prime minister of canada , traveled to china for a week of high-level meetings. he brought with him a handful of his cabinet ministers, including joe oliver, his tough-talking minister of natural resources who, until recently, had been withering in his scorn for the opponents of the keystone xl oil pipeline, which president obama rejected a few weeks ago. the pipeline, of course, was intended to transport vast oil reserves in alberta to the american refineries on the gulf of mexico. oliver no longer talks so freely about the environmental critics of the keystone pipeline; all of harper’s ministers have been instructed to stop making comments that might be construed as interfering in the american presidential election. but there are other, more diplomatic, ways to send messages. like going to china with your cabinet members and cutting energy deals with a country that has, as the globe and mail in toronto put it recently, a “thirst for canadian oil.” oil, i might add, that may be a little dirtier than the crude that pours forth from the saudi arabian desert — that is one of the main reasons environmentalists say they oppose keystone — but is hardly the environmental disaster many suppose. i realize that president obama rejected keystone because, politically, he had no choice. my guess is that, in his centrist heart of hearts, the president wanted to approve it. but to give the go-ahead before

Article 2 - obama orders cuts in federal greenhouse gas emissions
the federal government’s share of greenhouse gas emissions in the united states is minuscule — less than 1 percent in 2013, the last year for which data is available — so the order by itself is unlikely to make a major dent in the president’s broader goals to cut emissions. but because the federal government is the largest user of energy in the united states economy — encompassing 360,000 buildings, 650,000 fleet vehicles and $445 billion in annual spending on goods and services — it has the potential to influence private companies to step up their emissions-cutting targets. in conjunction with the executive order, the obama administration released a new scorecard to allow federal suppliers to disclose their emissions and track their reductions. several large companies that do business with the federal government — including i.b.m., general electric, honeywell and northrop grumman — announced new emissions-cutting goals of their own. “as we get economies of scale, and demand for solar and wind and other renewable energies grows, obviously that can help drive down the overall price, make it that much for efficient, and we start getting a virtuous cycle that is good for the economy and creates jobs here in america,” mr. obama said after touring the energy department’s solar-paneled rooftop. at a round table with representatives of some of the private corporations taking part, mr. obama praised the companies for stepping up with new or enhanced emissions-cutting targets. “you guys have done an

(ap) — the hard-eyed view along the tug fork river in west virginia coal country is that president-elect donald trump has something to prove: that he'll help bring back appalachian mining, as he promised time and again on the campaign trail. nobody thinks he can revive it entirely — not economists, not ex-miners, not even those recently called back to work. but for the first time in years, coal towns are seeing a commodity that had grown scarcer than the coal trains that used to rumble through around the clock: hope. around here that hope is measured. still, most voters saw trump as the only choice for president. he vowed to undo looming federal rules and said president barack obama had been ""ridiculous"" to the industry. trump told miners in charleston: ""we're going to take care of years of horrible abuse. i guarantee it."" west virginians went all in, backing trump and electing a coal mine-owning billionaire, democrat jim justice, as governor. but a

Article 4 - senate gets a climate and energy bill, modified by a gulf spill that still grows
it may be difficult, however, for him to persuade the senate to act. the country is nervously watching efforts to halt the gulf spill, the senate is torn by deep partisan hostility and the public is uncertain whether the benefits of combating global warming are worth the costs. there is also no assurance that the bill will break through the crowded senate calendar to reach the floor this year. no republicans have stepped forward to support the two senators’ efforts. president obama endorsed the proposal. “americans know what’s at stake by continuing our dependence on fossil fuels,” mr. obama said wednesday. “but the challenges we face — underscored by the immense tragedy in the gulf of mexico — are reason to redouble our efforts to reform our nation’s energy policies. for too long, washington has kicked this challenge to the next generation. this time, the status quo is no longer acceptable to americans.” he called on the senate to move ahead so that a final bill could be enacted this year. one of the central elements of the senate bill — incentives to increase domestic offshore oil production — was changed in the aftermath of the explosion and fire on the deepwater horizon drilling rig in the gulf on april 20, which left an undersea well leaking oil. instead of providing for a broad expansion of offshore drilling, the measure would have the effect of sharply limiting oil operations off the atlantic and pacific coasts by giving states the right to veto any drilling plan that

Article 5 - the missing campus climate debate
what presidents really mean is something more nuanced, like “divestment should be considered only in extraordinary cases about which there is broad consensus.” you can see why they might feel this way. causes abound. portuguese colonialism in africa was the outrage in 1972 when harvard students occupied university buildings and the word “divestiture” first emerged. today, students are calling for divestment from prison companies, china and israel. it’s easy to see how taking sides in the israeli-palestinian conflict would undermine universities’ role as a forum for open debate. divestment is a slippery slope. where do universities draw the line? columbia’s president, lee c. bollinger, says, “the bar has to be very high, and the reason is there are lots of things that people don’t like about the world.” but what better forum than the university could there be for distinguishing among competing moral claims? knowing students and professors, these debates would be prolonged, but it’s easy enough to structure the questions that would be asked and how they’d be answered regarding fossil fuels. first, what is the significance of the social cause? university presidents have overwhelmingly acknowledged the harm caused by fossil fuels, though some, including brown’s president, christina h. paxson, have argued that “this harm is moderated by the fact that coal is currently necessary for the functioning of the global economy.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify

Article 6 - ‘i’ve got your back,’ obama tells flint residents
“i really did need a glass of water,” mr. obama said as he sipped the water that an aide handed to him. “this is not a stunt.” many here welcomed the president’s message, but his visit, months after the magnitude of the water crisis became apparent, also prompted expressions of exasperation from residents who are still struggling to confront the health and safety repercussions of drinking lead-tainted water for months. when he landed in flint on wednesday, the president was greeted with evident good will from people here, many of whom voted for him twice and consider themselves supporters. but mixed with the affection were misgivings. many flint residents say that the federal environmental protection agency shares the blame for failing to forcefully intervene early in the crisis, even after receiving complaints in 2014 that the water was foul and discolored. dozens of neighbors and demonstrators gathered across the street from the high school where mr. obama was scheduled to appear. some chanted in unison, “obama, obama, can’t you see, this flint water is killing me.” others waved bottles filled with brown water and wore t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan #flintlivesmatter. volunteers carried clipboards, busily soliciting signatures as part of a statewide effort to recall gov. rick snyder. in the seventh month since officials acknowledged the crisis, with unfiltered water still unsafe to drink, many remain angry with mr. snyder

Article 7 - a call for climate solutions
to the editor: in his dec. 4 column, “the decadent left,” ross douthat paints the keystone xl pipeline protests as furthering the agendas of narrow interests. in fact, they are the opposite. they are about protecting resources americans hold in common and value deeply: our air, water and climate. climate change is not an elite concern; it is a force upending american lives with crippling drought, increased urban air pollution and devastating floods. that’s why the house passed a climate bill in 2009, but when the senate failed to do the same, americans saw few opportunities to push for climate action at the national level. the keystone xl pipeline gave them one. while we cannot do much about existing carbon pollution sources, we can stop dangerous new ones. canadians just delayed a similar pipeline for dirty tar sands oil on their own soil. that should be a clue for north america’s leaders, who have largely abdicated their responsibilities in this area, that people want climate solutions. frances beinecke president natural resources defense council new york, dec. 7, 2011

Article 9 - mr. obama’s energy future
during his run for the white house, barack obama pledged to transform the way americans produce and consume energy. such promises come cheap on the campaign trail. in the real world they cost money and political capital. this week, in his speech to congress, mr. obama made clear that he is ready to spend both to combat climate change and reduce this country’s dependence on fossil fuels. obviously, a lot of very heavy lifting lies ahead. the president must persuade everyone from congress to american taxpayers to the chinese leadership to follow. we applaud his vision and urge him to push forward. mr. obama listed energy, along with health care and education, as critical to the nation’s economic future. he urged congress to send him legislation that would place a mandatory and steadily declining cap on carbon emissions from power plants and other sources. this would require emitters to invest in more efficient plants and cleaner fuels and, at least initially, is likely to lead to higher energy prices. it was impossible to listen to him without drawing contrasts to the early bush days — to former president george w. bush ’s swift renunciation of his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide and his easy and unsubstantiated assumption that fighting climate change could only damage the american economy. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. obama’s commitment has been more than rhetorical. five weeks into his presidency, he has signaled a readiness to regulate greenhouse gases from cars, trucks and new power plants, to require more fuel efficient

Article 10 - confronting keystone again
the next chapter in the keystone xl pipeline saga has now begun. in january, president obama rejected the first proposal from transcanada, the pipeline company, on grounds that there was not enough time for a thorough environmental review of the project, which would carry crude oil from the alberta tar sands to the gulf coast. transcanada recently filed a new application with the state department, with alternative routes designed to avoid nebraska’s sand hills region, an environmentally sensitive area that is at risk from potential pipeline leaks. the department, which has jurisdiction over the project because the pipeline crosses an international boundary, must give the new application the most rigorous environmental review. it did a slipshod job on the company’s first proposal in 2010, brushing over some serious risks to the aquifer beneath the original route, as well as other environmental problems. it is far from clear whether one of the new routes proposed by transcanada would involve less potential damage in the case of a pipeline spill. and a route change does not alter other fundamental concerns. there has never been any doubt that extracting oil from tar sands is a dirty, energy-intensive process that damages landscapes, including huge swaths of canada’s forests, and produces more greenhouse gases than conventional oil extraction. the benefits, if any, would be minimal. the pipeline would produce at most a few thousand temporary construction jobs — 6,000 according to state department estimates. the project would do little to reduce gas prices or

President Obama's Decision on Keystone XL Pipeline Sparks Controversy

The recent decision by President Obama to block the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline has sparked intense debate among lawmakers and industry experts. The proposed pipeline, which would transport oil from Canada to refineries in the US, is seen as a crucial project for boosting economic growth and creating jobs.

However, critics argue that the president's decision is driven by environmental concerns rather than a genuine commitment to job creation and energy independence. Senator Marco Rubio has called the decision ""foolish"" and vowed to work with Congress to reverse it.

Meanwhile, Canada has expressed disappointment at the decision, with Prime Minister Harper stating that he hopes the project will continue despite the setback. The Canadian government is instead exploring alternative routes for its own oil exports, including a proposed pipeline through Western Canada.

The controversy highlights the deep divisions within the US energy sector and the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental concerns. As one industry expert noted, ""the Keystone XL pipeline would not only transport fuel safely but also boost economic activity along the way.""

The decision has also sparked criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with some accusing President Obama of caving to environmental pressure at the expense of American jobs and economic growth.

As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the Keystone XL pipeline will ultimately be built or if alternative routes for oil exports will become more prominent. One thing is clear: the decision has significant implications for the US energy sector and the economy as a

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE
---------------------
Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently traveled to China for a week of high-level meetings, accompanied by several cabinet ministers. The trip came amidst controversy surrounding the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which was rejected by President Barack Obama earlier this year.

Harper's government has been instructed to refrain from making comments that might be perceived as interfering in the American presidential election. However, the Prime Minister's office has taken a more diplomatic approach, using meetings with foreign leaders like China's to promote Canadian energy exports.

In contrast, the US federal government has announced plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 2% annually for the next decade. The move is seen as a step towards addressing climate change, although it may not have a significant impact on the country's overall carbon footprint.

Meanwhile, in the US, President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to revive coal mining jobs and boost oil production. His policies are expected to increase energy prices, but analysts warn that they could also worsen the global energy glut.

The debate over climate change is ongoing, with some arguing that it's a pressing issue that requires immediate attention. Others believe that the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions may not outweigh the costs.

As the world grapples with these complex issues, leaders are being forced to make difficult choices about how to balance economic growth with environmental protection. The outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the planet and future generations.

''alice is my patron saint, so it's very fitting that she follows me wherever i go. as a child, literature saved me. the idea of alice falling down the rabbit hole and the hole's altered reality is very interesting to me. fantasy has always been a big part of my life as an artist and a person.'' ms. graney, who is 45 and has not presented her work in new york in 15 years, succeeds with her visually compelling dances because of her willingness to submit to that surreal world. in ''tattoo,'' the final installment of a triptych exploring ritual in female cultures over time, the choreographer's dreamlike sensibility comes to life in cinematic and humorous terms. as part of dance theater workshop's around town series, the work makes its new york debut at the kitchen, wednesday through saturday.

Title: a rocky mountain dance festival makes its way to new york
Content: photo the notion of bringing the vail international dance festival to new york sounds a little odd. the festival’s most obvious attraction is its alpine setting, and neither the mountain backdrop of its main stage nor the starry nights that frame most performances are exportable. but the festival’s deeper distinctiveness lies in the programming of its artistic director, damian woetzel. this can travel, as will be evident when vail dance festival: remix nyc comes to city center nov. 3 to 6. [ more dance this fall: a season of indian mythology and ballets by women, and dance-makers pay tribute to aids victims ] mr. woetzel remains well known in new york from his days as a principal dancer with city ballet, and his sensibility and contacts remain new york-centric. many of the stars he hires for vail come from city ballet and american ballet theater. others, like carla körbes, recently retired from pacific northwest ballet but still in her prime, or gabriel missé, the tango master, are dancers whom new york doesn’t see enough. more important than the performers mr. woetzel hires, though, is what he asks them to do. ms. körbes will be dancing “elégie,” george balanchine’s final work. almost never performed in new york, it’s typical of mr. woetzel’s taste for rarities. also on one of three city center programs is balanchine’s 1967 “divertimento brillante,” a little gem that’s just as seldom seen. the vail version of balanchine’s “apollo” is the old one (with the birth prologue and the staircase finale) that city ballet hasn’t done for decades. mr. woetzel likes to give his dancers opportunities: one of the city center apollos, the ballet theater virtuoso herman cornejo, made his debut in the role at vail last year. mr. woetzel also encourages new work, like alexei ratmansky’s rhythmically playful “fandango,” which was created for the 2010 festival and will be given its new york premiere by sara mearns. that piece is right in ms. mearns’s wheelhouse, but often the new roles let the dancers stretch. robert fairchild, another apollo, will also be trying out the midcentury modern dance of josé limón, joined by his city ballet colleague and wife, tiler peck. ms. körbes’s feet, normally encased in point shoes, will protrude bare from the tube dress worn for martha graham’s severe “lamentations.”

9199541.0,reliable,reliable,0.9,143.39088773727417,True," The article ""the oceans' shifting balance"" aligns closely with the facts in the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, particularly in its discussion of ocean acidification and its effects on coral reefs. The article also mentions the potential long-term effects of ocean acidification, including the dissolution of shells and corals, which is consistent with the information presented in the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE presents a more nuanced view of climate change, suggesting that tiny marine algae can evolve to cope with its impacts. While this idea may be true, it does not align as closely with the facts presented in ""the oceans' shifting balance"" article, which focuses primarily on ocean acidification and its effects.  The RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE also provides more comprehensive information about climate change, including its impact on land and the economic consequences of inaction. This level of detail is not present in either the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE or ""the oceans' shifting balance"" article.  Overall, while both articles touch on similar topics, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE presents a more accurate and comprehensive view of climate change and its impacts, making it the most similar to ""the oceans' shifting balance"" article.","Climate Change: A Double-Edged Sword for Ocean Life

A recent study has revealed that tiny marine algae can evolve fast enough to cope with climate change, a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom on ocean resilience. The research, published in a leading scientific journal, found that certain types of phytoplankton can thrive even under conditions predicted for the mid-2100s.

However, this resilience is not universal, and other marine life forms are facing unprecedented threats from climate change. Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO2 levels, is having a devastating impact on coral reefs, which provide vital habitats for countless species. In fact, some studies suggest that coral reefs may disappear entirely by 2100.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of pollutants in the ocean, such as methane and soot, which can slow down sea level rise by up to 50%. However, these pollutants are often overlooked in favor of CO2 emissions, which are seen as the primary driver of climate change.

Geoengineering, a proposed solution to mitigate the effects of climate change, is also being questioned. Some researchers argue that it is a ""smoke and mirrors"" solution that does nothing to address the root causes of ocean acidification.

The Arctic Ocean, once thought to be a potential sink for CO2, may not absorb more CO2 under ice-free conditions. Instead, its exposed waters could lead to a positive feedback effect, exacerbating climate change.

The Australian Climate Commission has warned that humanity is running out of time to act on climate change, with the next decade being ""critical"" in determining the course of human history. The commission's report highlights the catastrophic consequences of inaction, including sea-level rise and extreme weather events.

As the world grapples with the complexities of climate change, it is clear that ocean life is facing unprecedented challenges. While some forms of marine life may be more resilient than others, the situation demands urgent attention and action to prevent irreparable damage to our planet's ecosystems.","Climate Change: A Global Crisis Requiring Immediate Action

A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has left no doubt that human activities are responsible for the steady rise in atmospheric temperatures. The consequences of inaction will be disastrous, including further melting at the poles, sea levels rising high enough to submerge island nations, and widespread famine.

The impact of climate change is not limited to polar regions. Ocean acidification is weakening coral structures in the Caribbean and cold-water coral reefs found in deep waters off Scotland and Norway. In the Pacific Northwest, the $1 billion shellfish industry is vulnerable to ocean acidification, with areas such as Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico at risk.

The effects of climate change are also being felt on land. Rising temperatures are causing more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. The economic impacts of these events can be devastating, with the 2012 superstorm Sandy causing over $70 billion in damage to the US economy.

In response to this crisis, cities, states, and regions are developing their own strategies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. California's ambitious plan aims to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, while nine northeastern states have joined a regional trading program aimed at reducing power-plant emissions.

However, the pace of action is slow, and the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic. The collapse of ice shelves such as Larson B in Antarctica is a stark reminder of the risks of global warming. The technology exists to greatly increase our use of renewable energy resources, but failure to act ensures more oil spills, pollution, and human suffering.

The world's scientists have done their job; now it's time for world leaders to take action. The IPCC report warns that time is running out, and the future of thousands of cities hinges on the distinction between decades or centuries of ice shelf collapse.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(scientific american is part of nature publishing group.) thorsten reusch, an author of sunday’s study at the geomar helmholtz-centre for ocean research in kiel, cautioned the findings about were only for one species of algae in a laboratory test, in water with

(before it's news) first published on climateprogress.org, a project of the center for american progress action fund, which was recently named one of time magazine’s top 25 blogs of 2010. solar radiation management – aka ‘hard’ geo-engineering — is, literally, a smoke and mirrors solution to the dangers posed by unrestricted emissions of greenhouse gases,. as science advisor john holdren resasserted in 2009 of strategies such as space mirrors or aerosol injection, “the ‘geo-engineering’ approaches considered so far appear to be afflicted with some combination of high costs, low leverage, and a high likelihood of serious side effects.“ and, of course, those ’solutions’ do nothing to stop the consequences of ocean acidification, which recent studies suggest will be devastating all by itself (see geological society: acidifying oceans spell marine biological meltdown “by end of century”). i appreciate that since a serious mitigation effort appears to be non-imminent, people are casting about for other ways to avoid multiple catastrophes (see “real adaptation is as politically tough as real mitigation, but much more expensive and not as effective in reducing future misery“). but geo-engineering without aggressive mitigation makes even less sense than adaptation without aggressive mitigation (see the vision of lomborg’s climate consensus is “a dystopic world out of a science fiction story”). i tend to agree with climatologist and geo-engineering research advocate ken caldeira: aerosol injection is, in

Article 4 - deadly and yet necessary, quakes renew the planet
many biologists believe that the process may have even given birth to life itself. the main benefits of plate tectonics accumulate slowly and globally over the ages. in contrast, its local upheavals can produce regional catastrophes, as the recent indian ocean quake made clear. even so, scientists say, the dec. 26 tsunamis may prove to be an ecological boon over the decades for coastal areas hardest hit by the giant waves. dr. jelle zeilinga de boer, a geologist at wesleyan university who grew up in indonesia and has studied the archipelago, says historical evidence from earlier tsunamis suggests that the huge waves can distribute rich sediments from river systems across coastal plains, making the soil richer. ""it brings fertile soils into the lowlands,"" he said. ""in time, a more fertile jungle will develop."" dr. de boer, author of recent books on earthquakes and volcanoes in human history, added that great suffering from tectonic violence was usually followed by great benefits as well. ""nature is reborn with these kinds of terrible events,"" he said. ""there are a lot of positive aspects even when we don't see them."" plate tectonics holds that the earth's surface is made up of a dozen or so big crustal slabs that float on a sea of melted rock. over ages, this churning sea moves the plates as well as their superimposed continents and ocean

Article 5 - u.s. seeks to limit environmental law's reach over coastal waters
offshore oil and gas drilling would not be affected by the administration's position because another law, the outer continental shelf lands act, specifically requires that the environmental law apply to such activity. at issue is the national environmental policy act, often referred to as the magna carta of environmental law. signed by president richard m. nixon on jan. 1, 1970, the act requires all federal governmental actions to be reviewed and analyzed for their effect on the environment. in an indication of the importance of the matter, the white house council on environmental quality convened with ranking officials from five agencies and departments to discuss the implications of the justice department's position both before the department filed its brief and then again this week, administration officials said. they plan to discuss it further in september. administration officials said there was little disagreement at the meeting, which was first reported today by the times-picayune of new orleans, about the administration's approach. and the justice department has argued in the sonar case that federal agencies should decide case by case whether to apply the national environmental policy act in the oceans. but e-mail messages written before the meeting suggested that officials from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration disagreed with the navy. one message written by a navy official hailed the ''good news'' that the justice department agreed with the navy, ''over noaa objection,'' that the environmental law ''does not extend beyond the limits of our territorial waters.'' administration officials said that the justice department position and the meeting

Article 7 - a new alliance on climate change
in an effort to compensate for the failure of central governments to address the dangers of climate change with comprehensive national policies, cities, states and regions have developed their own strategies to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. california’s ambitious plan aims to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050 by requiring cleaner cars, more energy-efficient buildings and renewable fuels. nine northeastern states have joined in a regional trading program aimed at reducing power-plant emissions. now a canadian province, british columbia, has joined california, oregon and washington in a new regional scheme called the pacific coast action plan on climate and energy. the agreement is not legally binding and contains no new money, but the overall objective is to step up the adoption of clean energy and link carbon pricing plans. california, like the northeastern states, has a cap-and-trade program; british columbia has had a carbon tax for five years. the governors of oregon and washington, both democrats, are working on ways to price carbon, though they could face tough-going in their state legislatures. the new coalition has been largely inspired by impatience with congress and the canadian parliament, both of which are in thrall to oil and seem deeply resistant to facing the reality of climate change. if it prospers, the coalition should have a lot of clout. together, the three states and british columbia have an enormous economy, a population of more than 50 million people, a history of economic and technological innovation

Article 9 - a warning from a chunk of antarctic ice
to the editor: re ''large ice shelf in antarctica disintegrates at great speed'' (news article, march 20): the dramatic satellite images documenting the breakup of the larson b ice shelf in antarctica are a sharp reminder of how global warming can cause rapid, large-scale change. critics of the kyoto climate treaty point out that the global system is extremely complicated and any predictions are fraught with potential error. this is undoubtedly true; catastrophe need not accompany global warming. however, the sudden collapse of a 12,000-year-old ice shelf the size of rhode island indicates that the risk of fossil fuel dependence may be far too high. the technology exists to greatly increase our use of renewable energy resources. failure to act ensures several things: more oil spills, more pollution in the lungs of city dwellers, more terrorists, more alliances with inhumane regimes. not to mention the unlikely but horrible possibility of a global climate so altered as to cause environmental damage and human suffering more vast than any war. stephen grant west newton, mass., march 21, 2002

Content: most of us understand that what we give off in the form of exhaust — from cars and manufacturing and energy production and burning forests — makes its way into the atmosphere, and is responsible for changes in the global climate. what is less familiar is the fact that the oceans are absorbing as much as a third of the carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere. the effects are already being felt. that added carbon dioxide is slowly making the oceans less alkaline and more acidic, altering the chemical balance on which much of oceanic life depends. carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, a process that consumes carbonate ions. those ions are necessary for the chemical reaction used to form calcium carbonate, the structural element in corals and the shells of many marine animals. as the oceans acidify, shells will simply dissolve. the growth of coral reefs will slow, and their structural integrity would be weakened, making them more vulnerable to storms and erosion. that would be a catastrophic loss. the list of potential long-term effects to oceanic life is only beginning to be explored. scientists have understood ocean acidification for a long time. but what they are learning now is how quickly it is increasing, in step with increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. new studies show that if carbon dioxide emissions continue at current rates, shells and corals could begin to dissolve — especially in the southern oceans — within 30 years. observations from many places, including the caribbean sea and the pacific ocean, suggest that ocean acidification is proceeding much faster than anyone had thought. combating a change as fundamental as this requires a fundamental change in awareness and behavior. what is needed is a mental stencil of the kind you find near storm drains in los angeles that say: “this drains to ocean.” a third of whatever we emit in the way of carbon dioxide ultimately drains to the ocean, which is all the more reason to curb emissions quickly.

Climate Change: A Double-Edged Sword for Ocean Life

A recent study has revealed that tiny marine algae can evolve fast enough to cope with climate change, a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom on ocean resilience. The research, published in a leading scientific journal, found that certain types of phytoplankton can thrive even under conditions predicted for the mid-2100s.

However, this resilience is not universal, and other marine life forms are facing unprecedented threats from climate change. Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO2 levels, is having a devastating impact on coral reefs, which provide vital habitats for countless species. In fact, some studies suggest that coral reefs may disappear entirely by 2100.

The situation is further complicated by the presence of pollutants in the ocean, such as methane and soot, which can slow down sea level rise by up to 50%. However, these pollutants are often overlooked in favor of CO2 emissions, which are seen as the primary driver of climate change.

Geoengineering, a proposed solution to mitigate the effects of climate change, is also being questioned. Some researchers argue that it is a ""smoke and mirrors"" solution that does nothing to address the root causes of ocean acidification.

The Arctic Ocean, once thought to be a potential sink for CO2, may not absorb more CO2 under ice-free conditions. Instead, its exposed waters could lead to a positive feedback effect, exacerbating climate change.

Climate Change: A Global Crisis Requiring Immediate Action

A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has left no doubt that human activities are responsible for the steady rise in atmospheric temperatures. The consequences of inaction will be disastrous, including further melting at the poles, sea levels rising high enough to submerge island nations, and widespread famine.

The impact of climate change is not limited to polar regions. Ocean acidification is weakening coral structures in the Caribbean and cold-water coral reefs found in deep waters off Scotland and Norway. In the Pacific Northwest, the $1 billion shellfish industry is vulnerable to ocean acidification, with areas such as Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico at risk.

The effects of climate change are also being felt on land. Rising temperatures are causing more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires. The economic impacts of these events can be devastating, with the 2012 superstorm Sandy causing over $70 billion in damage to the US economy.

In response to this crisis, cities, states, and regions are developing their own strategies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. California's ambitious plan aims to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050, while nine northeastern states have joined a regional trading program aimed at reducing power-plant emissions.

However, the pace of action is slow, and the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic. The collapse

8403672.0,reliable,fake,0.8,117.89225339889526,False,"The article ""Rise of Chinese Investment in the US: A Growing Concern"" contains several red flags that suggest it is a work of fiction. Firstly, the claim about a 200-acre Chinese city being planned for Michigan seems implausible and lacks concrete evidence. Additionally, the article's focus on China's economic reforms and its impact on the US market appears to be speculative and lacking in factual basis. Furthermore, the tone of the article is sensationalized and alarmist, which is typical of FAKE NEWS articles. In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE ""US-China Relations Under Scrutiny"" presents a more balanced and nuanced view of the complex issues surrounding US-China relations, making it a more credible source of information.","""Rise of Chinese Investment in the US: A Growing Concern""

A recent surge in Chinese investment in the United States has raised concerns among policymakers and business leaders. A 200-acre Chinese city is being planned for Michigan, near the cities of Detroit and Toledo, with plans to include artificial lakes, a cultural center, and hundreds of housing units for Chinese citizens.

This development is part of a larger trend of Chinese companies buying up land and businesses across the country. The US has seen significant investments from China in recent years, including the establishment of ""special economic zones"" modeled after the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

The growth of China's economy has been driven by its export-driven model, but demand in Western markets has dropped, and the country's society is changing. As a result, China's government is now considering reforms to transition to a full market economy.

However, concerns about intellectual property theft and trade secret protection are growing. Chinese companies have been accused of stealing trade secrets from US businesses, and measures are being taken to protect against this.

Meanwhile, the US has seen significant investments in its film industry, with China emerging as a major player. The country's box office is expected to continue growing, but it remains short of eclipsing the US market.

As the relationship between the US and China continues to evolve, policymakers will need to carefully consider the implications of this growth. With billions of dollars at stake, the stakes are high, and the consequences of failure could be severe.","US-China Relations Under Scrutiny

As the US and China continue to navigate complex diplomatic relations, several developments have come to light that highlight the challenges facing both nations. A recent high-level meeting between a US politician and Chinese officials has sparked concerns about the transparency of their discussions.

Meanwhile, trade tensions between the two countries remain a pressing issue. The US has taken steps to address what it sees as unfair market practices by Chinese companies, including imposing tariffs on steel imports from South Korea. This move is seen as an effort to level the playing field for American steel producers.

In another development, a group of labor advocates has filed a complaint with the US government, alleging that China's labor practices are inhumane and warrant trade penalties. The complaint highlights concerns about worker rights in China, which have been a point of contention between the two nations.

As the US seeks to strengthen its economic ties with China, there are also growing concerns about the role of Chinese military forces in international affairs. A recent test flight by a Chinese stealth fighter has raised questions about the level of transparency and cooperation between the two countries' defense establishments.

Despite these challenges, both sides continue to explore opportunities for cooperation and growth. The US is seeking to strengthen its economic ties with China, while China remains committed to expanding its global influence through trade and investment.

As the relationship between the US and China continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future of their diplomatic relations.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 3 - in trade stances toward china, clinton and trump both signal a chill
rapid economic growth in china and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country’s need for huge exports to the american market. but china’s economy has recently slowed, hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers. weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for china to maintain a large trade surplus with the united states, selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys. for years, china has exported four times as much to the united states as it imports, and it continues to do so. “if there are tougher trade policies from the united states,” said shen jianguang, an economist at mizuho securities asia, “that will dampen chinese exports.” the candidates plan to take direct aim at the two countries’ trade gap. they want to label china as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets. they want to file more trade cases against china and impose more tariffs. they want to investigate how the chinese government subsidizes businesses. they also want to rethink big trade deals. mr. trump wants to scrap the trans-pacific partnership, a free-trade agreement between the united states and a group of countries, mostly in asia. mrs. clinton’s campaign took a subtly different position, saying that she opposed the agreement in its current form. the asian countries involved in the trade pact, notably vietnam and japan, made significant concessions to american negotiators because they

''we are very grateful that the chinese economy is so active,'' mongolia's prime minister, nambaryn enkhbayar, said. noting that china is running short of coal, he said that a chinese company planned to start mining coal in eastern mongolia this year. dozens of cranes puncture the summer sky here as chinese construction crews build new apartment and office buildings

Article 8 - a.f.l.-c.i.o. files a trade complaint against china's labor practices
the federation filed a similar complaint two years ago, but mr. bush quickly rejected it, with administration officials saying they would use persuasion and cooperation, rather than confrontation, to deal with labor violations in china. at a news conference, a.f.l.-c.i.o. officials said on thursday that they might have a better chance persuading the administration to approve trade penalties this time because several members of congress are backing the complaint and because the annual trade deficit with china has soared more than 50 percent in two years, to $202 billion in 2005. representative christopher smith, republican of new jersey, said he was supporting the petition because china has arrested and imprisoned those who oppose unjust labor practices. ""there is no recourse for millions of chinese laborers trapped in poor working conditions,"" mr. smith said. ""despite the administration's efforts to encourage the chinese to comply with international labor standards, the chinese government continues to ignore worker rights."" stephen norton, a spokesman for the united states trade representative, said the government was studying the complaint. he said it was too early to speculate on the outcome.

asked if he truly believed that, mr. gates said, “i take president hu at his word.” but he said the episode also underscored concerns that the chinese military might sometimes act independently of the country’s political leadership, a growing worry of american defense officials who say they do not know the real goals of the secretive chinese armed forces. “i’ve had concerns about this over time,” mr. gates said. chinese officials provided only a brief summary of the meeting between mr. gates and mr. hu and did not address the perception by pentagon officials that mr. hu had not been informed of the test. a hong kong -based expert on the chinese military, andrei chang, said in a telephone interview that the chinese stealth fighter, which has the same two angled tailfins that are the trademark of the pentagon’s own stealth fighter, the f-22 raptor, flew for about 15 minutes over an airfield in the city of chengdu . photos of the jet in flight also appeared on a computer bulletin board run by global times, a state-run newspaper known for its hawkish positions. the j-20, a midair-refuelable, missile-capable jet designed to fly far beyond china’s borders, was for years kept in top-secret development by the chinese. american officials said they saw the test flight as a provocative display of muscle by china’s military but were unsure for whom the show was meant: mr. gates, mr. hu

the ruling said the action was intended to help american steel companies “seek relief from the market-distorting effects caused by injurious dumping and unfair subsidization of imports into the united states, establishing an opportunity to compete on a level playing field.” if the trade commission affirms that the dumping alleged by the commerce department has harmed the industry, varying duties would be imposed on imports of the tubes from the eight exporters. the department said tubes from south korea would receive tariffs of 9.89 percent to 15.75 percent. officials at american steel companies and their industry representatives hailed the decision as an important step toward fair competition. calling it “a good day for america’s steelworkers,” scott n. paul, the president of the alliance for american manufacturing, said, “the outpouring of bipartisan support from congress and the thousands of workers who took the time to make their voices heard underscored the importance of this decision.” mario longhi, the chief executive of united states steel, which was among the companies that initiated the complaint against their foreign rivals, said the decision would help his company and others compete for their fair share of the market for steel tubes. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error

Title: the selling of new jersey, and its difficulties
Content: gao yuzhi, vice director general of the foreign trade and economic cooperation bureau of zheijiang province, said through a translator: ''we came not only to sell. we have over 100 investment projects that are looking for investors,'' particularly in the pharmaceutical, chemical and health-care industries. for the past several years, the province -- which has a population of more than 40 million -- had exhibited at the jacob javits convention center in manhattan, and on this day the chinese seemed a bit stunned by the difference between the two locations. ''we're happy with the reception we've received in new jersey,'' wang huifen, an exhibitor, said through a translator. ''but we would have preferred seeing more people here.'' about 300 came the first day, but traffic slowed to a trickle on the second and third days, and walking into the hyatt seemed like entering a hotel in beijing, since asians far outnumbered americans. despite its disappointment at the small turnout, the delegation, which met with governor whitman during its stay, was determined to pursue trade with new jersey because of the state's economic influence. new jersey has the eighth largest economy in the country, and a gross state product of $327 billion, the governor's office said. if it were a country, new jersey would have the 16th-largest economy in the world. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. in addition, the chinese province has a long relationship with the state and with union county. zheijiang and new jersey are sister states, and wenzhou, another city in the province, has been a sister city with union county for the past 19 years -- though there has been little trade between them. mr. chou said chinese officials had hoped to hold the fair in union county, but they were unable to find a place that would accommodate the delegation. to be sure, many chinese provinces have trade fairs in the united states. ''it is one of the ways to promote chinese manufacturers and products,'' said zhang jie, third secretary of the commercial office of the chinese embassy in washington. ''it enhances the friendly exchange between the united states and the provinces and helps to publicize chinese products.'' as for zheijiang, ms. gao said her province and new jersey had much in common. like new jersey, zheijiang is neighbors with a large and influential city -- its main city, hangzhou, is about 100 miles from shanghai. the province's economy is ranked fourth in china, ms. gao said. the united states is

""Rise of Chinese Investment in the US: A Growing Concern""

A recent surge in Chinese investment in the United States has raised concerns among policymakers and business leaders. A 200-acre Chinese city is being planned for Michigan, near the cities of Detroit and Toledo, with plans to include artificial lakes, a cultural center, and hundreds of housing units for Chinese citizens.

This development is part of a larger trend of Chinese companies buying up land and businesses across the country. The US has seen significant investments from China in recent years, including the establishment of ""special economic zones"" modeled after the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

The growth of China's economy has been driven by its export-driven model, but demand in Western markets has dropped, and the country's society is changing. As a result, China's government is now considering reforms to transition to a full market economy.

However, concerns about intellectual property theft and trade secret protection are growing. Chinese companies have been accused of stealing trade secrets from US businesses, and measures are being taken to protect against this.

Meanwhile, the US has seen significant investments in its film industry, with China emerging as a major player. The country's box office is expected to continue growing, but it remains short of eclipsing the US market.

As the relationship between the US and China continues to evolve, policymakers will need to carefully consider the implications of this growth. With billions of dollars at stake, the stakes are high, and the consequences of failure could be severe.

US-China Relations Under Scrutiny

As the US and China continue to navigate complex diplomatic relations, several developments have come to light that highlight the challenges facing both nations. A recent high-level meeting between a US politician and Chinese officials has sparked concerns about the transparency of their discussions.

Meanwhile, trade tensions between the two countries remain a pressing issue. The US has taken steps to address what it sees as unfair market practices by Chinese companies, including imposing tariffs on steel imports from South Korea. This move is seen as an effort to level the playing field for American steel producers.

In another development, a group of labor advocates has filed a complaint with the US government, alleging that China's labor practices are inhumane and warrant trade penalties. The complaint highlights concerns about worker rights in China, which have been a point of contention between the two nations.

As the US seeks to strengthen its economic ties with China, there are also growing concerns about the role of Chinese military forces in international affairs. A recent test flight by a Chinese stealth fighter has raised questions about the level of transparency and cooperation between the two countries' defense establishments.

Despite these challenges, both sides continue to explore opportunities for cooperation and growth. The US is seeking to strengthen its economic ties with China, while China remains committed to expanding its global influence through trade and investment.

As the relationship between the US and China continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how these developments will shape the future of their diplomatic relations.

4565472.0,fake,fake,0.8,127.79731369018556,True," The article ""Experts Weigh in on Economic Uncertainty and Investing Strategies"" is the most similar to a fake news article because it contains sensational language, unsubstantiated claims, and biased opinions from experts with vested interests. The article quotes Jay Taylor as warning of an impending economic implosion, Peter Schiff as criticizing Timothy Geithner's views, and Bruce Berkowitz as advocating for ignoring the crowd in investment decisions. These statements are not supported by credible evidence or fact-checking.  In contrast, the Reliable News Article ""Wealth and Responsibility: A Delicate Balance"" presents a balanced view of the topic, citing expert opinions from Dr. Kathleen S. Gurney while avoiding sensational language and unsubstantiated claims. The article also provides nuanced discussions on complex issues, such as the impact of wealth on individuals and the importance of responsible financial management.  The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE is more similar to the given article in style and content because it employs a similar tone and structure, using quotes from experts with varying opinions to create a sense of controversy and urgency. The article also lacks credible sources and fact-checking, which are hallmarks of reliable news reporting.","Experts Weigh in on Economic Uncertainty and Investing Strategies

As the global economy continues to navigate uncertain waters, experts are sounding the alarm on the dangers of debt and inflation. Jay Taylor, a renowned financial analyst, warns that the US is ""heading toward implosion"" due to its insolvency and unsustainable debt levels.

Meanwhile, investors are seeking ways to protect their wealth in a volatile market. Peter Schiff, author of Crash Proof 2.0, has responded to criticisms from Timothy Geithner on the debt ceiling, stating that Geithner's claims are ""making this stuff up."" Schiff advocates for sound money and the right to own one's own assets, rather than relying on banks.

In a related development, investors are seeking alternative strategies to traditional investing. Bruce Berkowitz, a respected investor, has shared his mantra of ""ignore the crowd"" when it comes to making investment decisions. This approach involves looking beyond popular trends and focusing on data-driven insights.

The precious metals market is also experiencing significant changes. Dave Kranzler, an expert in the field, notes that the Fed's actions are terrorizing the market, driving down prices and creating opportunities for savvy investors.

In a more nuanced discussion of investing strategies, Kent Lucas, editor of Safe Haven Investor, emphasizes the importance of holding cash as part of a diversified portfolio. This approach can provide a ""rock"" for investment portfolios, protecting against losses in other asset classes.

As the economic landscape continues to shift, it's clear that investors must be vigilant and adaptable to succeed. By ignoring the crowd, focusing on data-driven insights, and maintaining a healthy dose of cash, investors can navigate these uncertain times with confidence.","Wealth and Responsibility: A Delicate Balance

For those who have recently inherited a significant sum of money, the decision on how to use it can be overwhelming. Dr. Kathleen S. Gurney, a leading expert in financial psychology, advises taking time to reflect on one's goals and priorities. She recommends creating a ""bliss list"" – a list of desired activities and purchases – to help guide investment decisions.

However, the influx of wealth can also lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety. A recent study found that individuals with high incomes often struggle with trust issues, particularly when it comes to government bailouts. Some experts argue that injecting cash into the main street economy could be more effective than focusing on Wall Street.

Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley, the tech elite are grappling with their own set of financial challenges. Despite being among the wealthiest communities in the country, many individuals in this industry feel pressure to keep their consumption private. This ambivalence towards wealth is reflected in the company's internal policies, which discourage employees from flaunting their purchases.

As people navigate these complex issues, it's essential to remember that wealth is not a guarantee of success or happiness. In fact, research suggests that excessive focus on material possessions can lead to feelings of emptiness and disconnection. By taking a thoughtful and intentional approach to managing one's finances, individuals can create a more balanced and fulfilling life.

Ultimately, the key to responsible wealth management lies in striking a balance between financial prudence and personal fulfillment. By prioritizing goals, values, and relationships, individuals can harness the power of their wealth to create positive change in the world around them.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 5 - speech given to the committee for monetary research and education
speech given to the committee for monetary research and education (before it's news) before addressing the consequences of today’s macro-economic policies i want to tell you my philosophy. i support sound money for two very good reasons: 1. firstly, it is a basic human right to choose to save, without our savings being debased by the tax of monetary inflation. those that are worst affected by this inflation tax are not the rich, they benefit; but the poor and the barely well-off, which is why monetary inflation undermines society and why the right to sound money should be respected. if government gives itself a monopoly over money, it has a duty to protect the property rights vested in it. 2. secondly, it is a basic right for us to own our own money rather than have it owned by the banks. for them to take our money and expand credit on the back of it debases it. it is an abuse of an individual’s property rights and a banking licence is a government licence to do so. if anyone else was to do this, they would be guilty of fraud. banks should be custodians of our money, and it should not appear in their balance sheets as their property. if we had stuck to these sound money principals, several benefits automatically follow, some of which i will briefly summarise for you, and i will have a little more to say about them in a moment: 1. with sound money, governments cannot print money to fund their activities

Article 6 - wsj seeks hedge fund reporter
(before it's news) from talking biz news justin baer, the investing editor at the wall street journal, sent out the following announcement to the staff on monday morning: the wall street journal is seeking an aggressive reporter to cover the hedge-fund industry, a core beat in the money & investing section and an area of keen interest to our readers, especially in these volatile market times when global tumult is reshaping the industry. from george soros and john paulson to steve cohen and ken griffin, the industry boasts some of wall street’s biggest names, brightest minds and most powerful players—many of whom also happen to draw some of the world’s biggest paychecks. these managers can move markets either by succeeding or failing and, as we witnessed during the financial crisis, can seal the fate of even the largest securities firms. with tens of billions of dollars in new money flowing into hedge funds every year, their influence should only increase. the power and vast personal fortunes these managers have compiled have also brought more scrutiny to a corner of wall street largely unaccustomed to, and uncomfortable with, such attention. the successful candidate must know finance, with a proven ability to break news as well as a track record of identifying conceptual trends that drive larger stories. good writing is also a must, given the vivid cast of characters that inhabit the hedge-fund world. the job is based in new york. interested candidates should contact francesco guerrera, rick brooks or just

(before it's news) this post six months from now, you could be rolling in money from oil gains appeared first on daily reckoning. one of my very favorite investors is bruce berkowitz, who manages the fairholme fund. i love the way the man invests. his portfolio is concentrated on his very best ideas, most of which are highly contrarian. at one point after the global financial crisis, he had an incredible 40% of his fund invested in the universally hated aig (which has since doubled)! i’m not here to sell you on bruce berkowitz (although his long-term performance is exceptional) or even invest using his concentrated style. what i do want to do is share with you the mantra with which he manages his fund, because i think it is especially applicable today. pasted front and center on the fairholme website in bold are three words: ignore the crowd. today, the crowd would have us believe that there is a “glut” of oil and that we have entered a new era of lower oil prices. i’ve listened to what the crowd has had to say about oil. the talking heads, the attention-grabbing articles… “the talking heads, the attention-grabbing articles… [are] heavy on opinion, but very light on data.” what i’ve found in

mr. monaghan, who has called the florida campus and town “god’s will,” has even loftier intentions. he has said that he sees the university, which says it adheres to a strict interpretation of catholic doctrine, as a chance to save souls. “i’m a businessman. i get to the bottom line,” mr. monaghan, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the orlando sentinel in 2004. “and the bottom line is to help people get to heaven.” yet as he aims for the divine, mr. monaghan has been facing some unexpected earthly trials, including a revolt at his law school in ann arbor and sharp criticism by many of the conservative catholics who once supported his foundation’s projects. in many ways, mr. monaghan’s troubles illustrate how difficult it can be for wealthy, driven entrepreneurs to make the transition to full-time philanthropy, particularly when they have single-minded ideas about how they want their money spent. traits that make successful business leaders — ego, ambition, determination, even a touch of imperiousness — do not necessarily go over well in charitable work, causing even the most well-intentioned projects to founder. as the legendary investor warren e. buffett recently noted when he donated most of his $40 billion fortune to an established foundation rather than create one of his own, making a mint — as difficult as that is — can be easier than giving it away. photo as he tries to build a

Wealth and Responsibility: A Delicate Balance

For those who have recently inherited a significant sum of money, the decision on how to use it can be overwhelming. Dr. Kathleen S. Gurney, a leading expert in financial psychology, advises taking time to reflect on one's goals and priorities. She recommends creating a ""bliss list"" – a list of desired activities and purchases – to help guide investment decisions.

However, the influx of wealth can also lead to feelings of guilt and anxiety. A recent study found that individuals with high incomes often struggle with trust issues, particularly when it comes to government bailouts. Some experts argue that injecting cash into the main street economy could be more effective than focusing on Wall Street.

Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley, the tech elite are grappling with their own set of financial challenges. Despite being among the wealthiest communities in the country, many individuals in this industry feel pressure to keep their consumption private. This ambivalence towards wealth is reflected in the company's internal policies, which discourage employees from flaunting their purchases.

As people navigate these complex issues, it's essential to remember that wealth is not a guarantee of success or happiness. In fact, research suggests that excessive focus on material possessions can lead to feelings of emptiness and disconnection. By taking a thoughtful and intentional approach to managing one's finances, individuals can create a more balanced and fulfilling life.

Ultimately, the key to responsible wealth management lies in striking a balance between financial prudence and personal fulfillment.

Experts Weigh in on Economic Uncertainty and Investing Strategies

As the global economy continues to navigate uncertain waters, experts are sounding the alarm on the dangers of debt and inflation. Jay Taylor, a renowned financial analyst, warns that the US is ""heading toward implosion"" due to its insolvency and unsustainable debt levels.

Meanwhile, investors are seeking ways to protect their wealth in a volatile market. Peter Schiff, author of Crash Proof 2.0, has responded to criticisms from Timothy Geithner on the debt ceiling, stating that Geithner's claims are ""making this stuff up."" Schiff advocates for sound money and the right to own one's own assets, rather than relying on banks.

In a related development, investors are seeking alternative strategies to traditional investing. Bruce Berkowitz, a respected investor, has shared his mantra of ""ignore the crowd"" when it comes to making investment decisions. This approach involves looking beyond popular trends and focusing on data-driven insights.

The precious metals market is also experiencing significant changes. Dave Kranzler, an expert in the field, notes that the Fed's actions are terrorizing the market, driving down prices and creating opportunities for savvy investors.

In a more nuanced discussion of investing strategies, Kent Lucas, editor of Safe Haven Investor, emphasizes the importance of holding cash as part of a diversified portfolio. This approach can provide a ""rock"" for investment portfolios, protecting against losses in other asset classes.

Article 9 - the eyes of nocturnal insects give researchers new ideas for anti-glare coatings
credit: youris.com some of the most efficient arcs are made by mother nature and are found in the eyes of insects. the eyes of moths, for example, are covered with a layer of tiny bumps which are smaller than the wavelength of incoming light. this natural coating eliminates glare, hiding the moths from predators and improving their nocturnal vision. some types of arcs actually mimic the moth’s eye. these coatings are effective, but they are relatively expensive and difficult to customize. a group at the max planck institute for intelligent systems in stuttgart, coordinated byjoachim p. spatz, has developed a new way to produce moth eye-like coatings. according to the inventors, the resulting coatings have a cost similar to that of classic arcs and can be easily customized. the manufacturing process developed at the max planck institute – which uses gold nanoparticles – produces regular, tiny bumps similar to that found in the moths’ eyes. structural parameters such as period, height and shape of these structures can be easily controlled, say the german group. researchers have formed a spin-off team to exploit and commercialise their solution.

Article 1 - devices go nose to nose with bomb-sniffer dogs
the devices use a fluorescent polymer technology developed by timothy m. swager, a chemist at m.i.t. under whom dr. rose studied. thin films of the polymers emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet rays, but molecules of tnt stop the fluorescence. a single tnt molecule can quench many thousands of fluorescence reactions, greatly increasing sensitivity. dr. spitzer’s approach is far different, and also far from being commercialized. the slivers of silicon, called microcantilevers, are fixed at one end and made to vibrate, like a diving board. as molecules of explosives are captured by the cantilever, the added mass alters the rate of vibration, which can be measured by a laser or other means. microcantilevers are already used in many sensing applications, but for explosives the cantilevers alone are not sensitive enough. growing hollow cylinders of titanium oxide, called nanotubes, increases the surface area, allowing more molecules to be captured. sensitivity is critical because many explosives compounds, including powerful ones like rdx and petn, are not very volatile — at normal temperatures, very few molecules vaporize. as a result, bomb detection — which became a priority in aviation after a hidden device destroyed a pan am jetliner over lockerbie, scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people — has focused more on finding explosive particles on surfaces than on detecting molecules in the air. david atkinson, chief scientist for explosives detection

Article 3 - juggling buckyballs raises hope of warmer superconductors
in 1991, scientists at bell labs, then part of at&t, first discovered that buckyballs -- molecules made of 60 carbon molecules arrayed in the shape of a soccer ball -- can be turned into superconductors when mixed with potassium. buckyballs are named after r. buckminster fuller, designer of the geodesic dome that they resemble. superconductors can carry electrical current without any resistance. but the buckyballs switched back into insulators at temperatures above minus-427 degrees, and further research nudged the transition temperature to minus-400. even that was a scientifically noteworthy accomplishment -- conventional superconductors up to that point had topped out at about minus-418. high-temperature superconductors, which work by a different mechanism still not understood by scientists, have transition temperatures as warm as minus-164 degrees. high-temperature superconductors, made of copper oxides, tend to be brittle, however. buckyball superconductors could potentially be more amenable for some applications, but buckyballs also have complications: they tend to degrade in the presence of oxygen. in the latest efforts, instead of adding potassium, the layer of aluminum oxide along with three gold electrodes form an electronic device known as a field-effect transistor on the surface of a pure crystal of buckyballs. the potassium had contributed electrons that carried electric current by hopping from buckyball to buckyball. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're

visit any of the “proper” cocktail bars in new york and it is clear that the ice in one’s drink has become almost as important as the drink itself. the once humble cube of frozen water is now mentioned in terms usually associated with the other “ice” (cut, clarity and size) and is made into balls, cylindrical columns and squares of all sizes, sometimes even hand-carved. “ice used to be seen as the thing that fills up the glass,” said eben freeman, director of bar operations and innovation for altamarea group, a company that owns restaurants like marea and ai fiori. “now, big, square cold-draft cubes are the hallmark of a serious cocktail bar.” mr. freeman, 43, considers himself an ice aficionado, having spent more than two decades working in dining and drinking establishments like wd-50, eleven madison park and red cat. with outdoor entertaining season already in full swing, he set out on a recent sweltering afternoon to find trays for making good-looking ice at home. photo the key is to “take the time to fill the trays all the way up,” he said, “and to always wash them after you’re done. don’t just refill them.” also, it helps “not have stinky stuff in your freezer, because ice can absorb the smells.” advertisement continue reading the main story his first stop was t & t plastic land in tribeca. four years ago, when mr.

Article 7 - marketing, as taught by credit card issuers
but financial institutions are facing growing criticism over the ease with which college students can obtain credit. ''it's harder to get credit after graduation than it is if you've never had a job and you're a full-time student,'' said robert manning, a visiting sociology professor at georgetown university. more than half of students at four-year colleges have at least one credit card, usually by the end of their first year, according to student monitor. it says 41 percent of these students carry a balance, averaging $584. they spend an average of $131 a month. mr. manning accuses the issuers of pushing cards on the young and unready. ''they've tried to create this whole view that credit cards are plastic money'' rather than debt, he said. the issuers respond by pointing to seminars they sponsor that explain how credit cards work and the importance of maintaining creditworthiness.

Article 8 - in a lab in poland, plastic that can crawl
video it’s about half an inch long, a few millimeters wide and no thicker than a human hair, and it usually just sits there like a discarded strip of red cellophane — until a specific shade of green laser light strikes it. then the university of warsaw’s new robot caterpillar shows what it can do. it can move across a surface by itself, scrunching into a series of undulating shapes that run down its length in wavelike spasms. and it can even carry 10 times its weight while in motion. “the idea is just starting in science that robots can be something without wires and batteries and motors,” said mikolaj rogoz, a researcher in the photonic nanostructure facility at the university’s institute of experimental physics. “it can be just fragments of plastic and energy, and the energy source can be provided from outside the robot.” the institute unveiled its new invention in late august in the scientific journal advanced optical materials to much fanfare in poland. the news came just a few weeks after researchers in italy unveiled their own soft robot — an octopus — that they intend to use to explore the mediterranean seabed. advertisement continue reading the main story the warsaw caterpillar is made of a kind of plastic known as liquid crystalline elastomers, mr. rogoz said. the laser light powers the robot by pinpointing and changing the shape of specific molecules in the plastic. other types of soft robots may

Article 9 - diamonds find a friend in the semiconductor sector
the research group, which began looking into the vapor deposition method four years ago, has created diamonds as thick as about one-fifth of an inch and as wide as two-fifths of an inch, dr. hemley said. dr. hemley, a member of the institution's geophysical laboratory, said his interest in diamonds was related to basic research in the behavior of materials at extreme pressures. ''we need large, perfect diamonds to make high-pressure devices for our research,'' he said. but diamonds like the ones the group has grown will have many other uses, including electronics, he said. apollo diamond, a boston company, is also growing large, single crystal diamonds by using a version of the chemical vapor deposition method, said robert c. linares, a founder of the company. researchers have long sought ways to use diamonds as a more durable alternative to silicon, which does not stand up as well to high temperatures and stress. but many early diamonds made by vapor deposition were poorly suited to electronic applications because they emerged in the form of a film with a jumble of diamond crystals oriented in varying ways, leading to defects that could trap electrons. the researchers at carnegie grew their diamonds from a gaseous mixture heated to high temperatures to produce the carbon that condensed on a diamond kernel. ''we start with a seed, and the carbon atoms then rain out from the plasma, arranging themselves as a single crystal rather than as a film,'' dr. hemley said

Article 10 - yes, they can! no, they can't: charges fly in nanobot debate
if swarms of nanobots were capable of such miraculous feats, they could also conceivably multiply out of control: a microscopic mechanical cancer that pushed biological life to extinction. drawing on dr. drexler's work, bill joy, chief scientist of sun microsystems, argued in april 2000 in wired magazine that humanity was on the technological road to ruin and that scientists should voluntarily give up research that could lead to nanobots. taking the anti-nanobot view was dr. richard e. smalley, a nobel prize-winning professor of chemistry at rice university. he wrote that while the broader field of nanotechnology held great promise, a nanobot was impossible -- and so, by corollary, was extinction by runaway nanobots. the two first skirmished in september 2001 in two articles in scientific american. more recently, dr. drexler heard that dr. smalley had again dismissed the prospect of nanobots, so this year he posted an open letter on his web site, www .foresight.org/, accusing his rival of trying ''to dismiss my work by misrepresenting it.'' the two scientists stake positions on opposite sides of the possible. dr. drexler's proposals for nanobots do not violate fundamental physical laws like the speed of light or conservation of energy, he says, so they should be possible. the problem is developing the technology, and his ''nanosystems'' (1992) offers a

In contrast to the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE, which presents a balanced view of various scientific developments and debates, this article seems to prioritize emotional appeal over factual accuracy. The tone is also more alarmist and critical of scientists, which is reminiscent of tabloid science reporting. Overall, the language and structure of the article suggest that it is intended to mislead or provoke rather than inform or educate readers.","""Science in the Spotlight: A Delicate Balance""

The recent announcement of a groundbreaking discovery has sparked intense debate among scientists and the general public. The revelation, which has been hailed as a major breakthrough, has raised questions about the role of science in society and the process of scientific discovery.

While some have praised the openness of the research team, others have expressed frustration with the lack of peer review and the speed at which the findings were made public. This phenomenon highlights the complex relationship between scientists, media, and the public.

In a related development, researchers have been exploring new theories about the nature of dark matter, a concept that has long been debated in scientific circles. Some experts have expressed skepticism about these claims, citing concerns about data quality and methodology.

Meanwhile, the search for the ""God particle"" continues, with scientists working tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the universe. The discovery of this elusive particle is seen as a major milestone in understanding the fundamental laws of physics.

However, not all scientists are convinced that science has reached its ultimate goal. Some argue that the pursuit of knowledge should be guided by a clear purpose and direction, rather than simply following the latest trends and discoveries.

As the scientific community continues to grapple with these issues, it is essential to strike a balance between openness, transparency, and rigor. By doing so, we can ensure that science remains a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the world and improving human lives.","Scientists and experts are weighing in on the latest developments in various fields, sparking debates about the nature of reality and our understanding of the universe.

In a recent speech at Oxford University, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking warned that humanity may have only 1,000 years left before facing an existential threat. His prediction has been met with skepticism by some, who point out that he has made similar claims in the past without any change to his timeline.

Meanwhile, scientists are making rapid progress in understanding the human genome. A recent breakthrough has led to a more accurate and complete sequence of the genome, which is expected to revolutionize our understanding of genetics and disease.

However, not all experts agree on the validity of certain scientific theories. Some have questioned the credentials of a researcher who has proposed radical revisions to basic laws of physics, leading to concerns about the integrity of his work.

In contrast, other scientists are making significant strides in understanding complex systems and emergent phenomena. Researchers are exploring new ideas that challenge traditional notions of reality, including the possibility that fundamental laws may have emerged from the vacuum of space.

The debate over creationism versus scientific theory is also ongoing. A recent debate between a Christian creationist and an agnostic scientist highlighted the differences in their perspectives on the origins of life and the natural world.

As we continue to explore the universe and push the boundaries of human knowledge, it's clear that there are many questions still unanswered. But with scientists like Stephen Hawking and others leading the way, we can expect new breakthroughs and discoveries that will shape our understanding of the world around us.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - scientists and the news media: arsenic-based life forms a case study? [dean's corner]
scientists and the news media: arsenic-based life forms a case study? [dean's corner] (before it's news) scientists including the news media in the process of discovery is a volatile affair, as we have all witnessed recently. my fellow bloggers on scienceblogs, we beasties, discussed the role of bloggers and scientists in the process of the nasa scientists announcing their discovery of “arsenic-based life forms”. generally speaking, as a scientist i have always been bothered by the idea of a press release to announce a scientific discovery before i had an opportunity to carefully review the study myself. typically, a friend or neighbor would say “hey, did you hear about the discovery of …” and i would not be aware, because the paper had not yet been published. how incredibly frustrating! you mean the public has an opportunity to learn about the discovery before the scientists’ colleagues?? regardless, this is the path that was taken with the announcement of the supposed arsenic-based lifeforms. in the aftermath of the firestorm in the blogosphere and elsewhere, in today’s american geophysical union meeting in san francisco, an interview with these scientists addressed some questions from the press and the public, despite the fact that earlier they had been insistent that the process of self-correcting science would take place exclusively within the realm of peer-reviewed science – something i understand completely. below is an excerpt of the interview today: question: is there anything else you’d like for the public

(before it's news) although the reference in this bulletin uses the uk as an illustration of the rapid retraction of scientific funding, the principle applies all around the globe. it is as though budget constraints in general are dimming the aspirations of science, although i wonder if that is the entire story. in times of surplus and plenty folks tend to let a lot of “novelty” expenditures slide by. in the case of science and its pursuit to improve our knowledge base and inspire progress, assumption is… all scientific activity is good by simple mind conditioning to that assumption. many scientific projects have no obvious, direct immediate benefit… but we are assured ultimately… “trickle down” benefits will come from even the most pointless sounding projects. pointless in terms of current need when compared to projects addressing theoretical proofs of someones pet imaginative idea or cool sounding discovery exploit. all that being said, times of duress and increasing deficits tend to throw a damper on the fun and games. i am pleased we are in pursuit of a theoretical god particle although i would be even more pleased with a cure for the common cold. perhaps it is these idle thoughts that cast doubt on the value of science having no well defined purpose. that is how it seems to me when i read all of the complex sounding initiatives dribbled out of the scientific community sand box. i see a whole lot of unlocking the secrets of

(photo of the big bang theory cast courtesy cbs) i think science is wonderful, fascinating, life-enriching, and generally the best thing since the big bang. so it may seem odd to head up a post ‘why is science boring?’ – but the fact is, like it or not, the majority of people consider it to be so. so those of us whose job is communicating science need to be aware of this and its implications. despite occasionally enjoying pointing out its failings, i am quite fond of qi, and have observed something quite interesting about the general attitude to science there. if there is a guest with a science background like dara o’briain or ben miller, then whenever that person answers a science question with a little bit of detail the other team members glaze over and generally act bored. so why does this happen, and how can we get around the issues? here’s a few thoughts, which i can guarantee aren’t comprehensive, but are a starting point. a lot of science teaching is boring. if you are a science teacher, i’m sorry, but this is true. a fair amount of the blame is down to the curriculum – it is still essentially victorian, and ought to be re-written from the bottom up, as at the moment it ignores most of the really exciting bits of science like relativity or

Article 8 - back to sanity: beyond the limits of materialistic science
by steve taylor ph.d guest writer for wake up world many people believe that the powers of science are unlimited. science is a process of uncovering the mechanisms by which nature works, and eventually, after enough experimentation and investigation, every mystery will be understood. the darkness of ignorance will have been completely illuminated by the light of reason, and we will possess the truth about life and the universe. some observers even believe that we’re quite close to reaching this point now. if scientific progress continues at the same rate as the last few decades, so this argument goes, it can only be a matter of a few more decades (or even less) before all the mysteries in the universe are solved. after all, haven’t most of the biggest mysteries already been solved? as long ago as 1971 the biologist bentley glass wrote, ‘we are like the explorers of a great continent, who have penetrated to its margins in most points of the compass and have mapped the major mountain chains and rivers. there are still innumerable details to fill in, but the endless horizons no longer exist.’

(before it's news) technology, consciousness, and how the universe is built by jon rappoport may 15, 2013 www.nomorefakenews.com in the early 1990s, hypnotherapist jack true was trying to show me how perception operated in hypnotized subjects. as a joke, well it was a half-joke, he said the following: “if you’re doing a scientific experiment on gravity, and you start dropping various objects from the top of a building, you’re going to find out some interesting things about the way gravity operates in the universe. “but if you don’t care about gravity and science, when you drop the objects from the roof, some will fall and others will float.” what he meant was this: if you want to find out how to build things and run things and propel things and blow up things, you can look into the universe and eventually obtain that information. the information will seem to be definitive about how the universe is built. it will seem to be the only model. it will seem to be the truth. but that’s an illusion. actually, competing models about the universe are available, and depending on your intent, you can discover and put together as many as you need. they all work. they all look like mutually exclusive systems. but they aren’t. the picture of tiny particles

Article 2 - in the genome race, the sequel is personal
huntington f. willard, a geneticist at duke university who has had early access to dr. venter’s genome sequence, said that the quality of the new genome was “exceptionally high” and that “until the next genome comes along this is the gold standard right now.” dr. willard said it was “hugely better” than the consortium’s sequence, at least for his particular research interest. “i don’t want to fan the fires but i like this, it’s a really good genome,” said edward m. rubin, a genome expert at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory. dr. venter’s race with the consortium began in 1998 when he spotted a quicker method of decoding the human genome. he tried to wrest this rich scientific prize from his academic rivals by co-founding a genome-decoding company called celera. by june 2000, the two sides were neck and neck preparing a draft sequence of the genome. but in january 2002, dr. venter was abruptly fired as president of celera. the consortium went on to claim victory when it announced its completion of the genome the next year. but the consortium’s genome, though immensely useful to biologists, was full of gaps and only complete in the sense that it was the best that could be done with existing technology. dr. venter has spent the last five years and an extra $10 million of his institute’s money in improving the

to the editor: although certainly not ethical, the fudging of results by scientists has existed for centuries (''on scientific fakery''). two reasons come to mind. first, the researcher, convinced that his assumptions are correct, forces the data to fit preconceived views. second, the scientist is so pressed by his company, academia or his peers for a major breakthrough that he manufactures data that do not exist. although neither reason is valid, it certainly explains why scientists from time immemorial -- some quacks, others convinced of the correctness of their views, some even eminent scientists and some attempting to elevate their status among fellow scientists -- have resorted to deception or falsification. nelson marans silver spring, md.

Article 6 - new contenders for a theory of everything
many complex systems -- the very ones the solid-staters study -- appear to be irreducible. made of many interlocking parts, they display a kind of synergy, obeying ''higher organizing principles'' that cannot be further simplified no matter how hard you try. carrying the idea even further, some solid-state physicists are trying to show that the laws of relativity, long considered part of the very bedrock of the physical world, are not platonic truths that have existed since time began. they may have emerged from the roiling of the vacuum of space, much as supply-and-demand and other ''laws'' of economics emerge from the bustle of the marketplace. if so, then solid-state physics, which specializes in how emergent phenomena occur, may be the most fundamental science of them all. ''we're in the midst of a paradigm change,'' dr. pines said. ''ours is not the prevailing view, but i think it will turn out to be the one that lasts.'' working in this vein, one of dr. laughlin's stanford colleagues, dr. shoucheng zhang, recently was co-author of a paper suggesting that elementary particles like photons and gravitons, the carriers of electromagnetism and gravity, might not be so elementary after all -- they might emerge as ripples in the vacuum of space, bubbling up from the quagmire in a way that can best be explained in terms of solid-state physics.

Title: a new low in tabloid science reporting
Content: a new low in tabloid science reporting headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by brian clegg every now and then i have to sit down and breathe deeply when seeing a tabloid science headline that is about as far as the truth as is possible. usually such headlines use a kind of bait and switch mechanism where the headline proclaims something dramatic, but the article makes much weaker claims, or points out that most scientists think this is a load of tosh. (even new scientist rather likes doing this.) but the daily express has come up with an outright winner where the article backs up the headline with a story that bears little resemblance to science as we know it. let’s see if we can spot what’s a little iffy with this ‘scientists discover what existed before the beginning of the universe’ article: scientists have not ‘discovered’ anything. that means finding something. what has happened is someone has come up with a model that produces these results. it’s a bit like confusing having a business plan with being a billionaire. we read in the article ‘they discovered what came before this universe was.. another universe or more accurately another “cosmological phase”.’ see above re what a discovery is. in reality they’ve made an educated guess based on a model. but best of all, we read ‘despite being infinite in size our universe is cyclical and has always existed in one of four stages.’ whoa – paul baldwin, the writer of this piece seems to know an awful lot the rest of us don’t. we don’t know the universe is infinite, we don’t know it’s cyclical and we don’t know it has always existed in one of four stages. the rest – ‘despite’ – is true. when we get on to quotes from the scientists involved it all settles down. all they talk about is their model, not the universe itself. they point out their model avoids singularities, which is a nice to have (though hardly unique). so, as a guide for intrepid tabloid hacks, here’s the main thing to remember. a model is just that. to say that universe is like x because someone has a model of it is like saying a child can destroy westminster abbey by standing on it, because someone built a model of the abbey out of matchsticks and that’s what happened when a child stood on the model. let me finish off with that sentence again, because it fascinates me. it has all the attraction of a slow motion traffic accident. ‘despite being infinite in size our universe is cyclical and has always existed in one of four stages.’ wow. now appearing is the blog of science writer brian clegg (www.brianclegg.net), author of inflight science, before the big bang and the god effect. source: http://brianclegg.blogspot.com/2016/10/a-new-low-in-tabloid

""Science in the Spotlight: A Delicate Balance""

The recent announcement of a groundbreaking discovery has sparked intense debate among scientists and the general public. The revelation, which has been hailed as a major breakthrough, has raised questions about the role of science in society and the process of scientific discovery.

While some have praised the openness of the research team, others have expressed frustration with the lack of peer review and the speed at which the findings were made public. This phenomenon highlights the complex relationship between scientists, media, and the public.

In a related development, researchers have been exploring new theories about the nature of dark matter, a concept that has long been debated in scientific circles. Some experts have expressed skepticism about these claims, citing concerns about data quality and methodology.

Meanwhile, the search for the ""God particle"" continues, with scientists working tirelessly to uncover the secrets of the universe. The discovery of this elusive particle is seen as a major milestone in understanding the fundamental laws of physics.

However, not all scientists are convinced that science has reached its ultimate goal. Some argue that the pursuit of knowledge should be guided by a clear purpose and direction, rather than simply following the latest trends and discoveries.

As the scientific community continues to grapple with these issues, it is essential to strike a balance between openness, transparency, and rigor. By doing so, we can ensure that science remains a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the world and improving human lives.

RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE

Scientists and experts are weighing in on the latest developments in various fields, sparking debates about the nature of reality and our understanding of the universe.

In a recent speech at Oxford University, renowned physicist Stephen Hawking warned that humanity may have only 1,000 years left before facing an existential threat. His prediction has been met with skepticism by some, who point out that he has made similar claims in the past without any change to his timeline.

Meanwhile, scientists are making rapid progress in understanding the human genome. A recent breakthrough has led to a more accurate and complete sequence of the genome, which is expected to revolutionize our understanding of genetics and disease.

However, not all experts agree on the validity of certain scientific theories. Some have questioned the credentials of a researcher who has proposed radical revisions to basic laws of physics, leading to concerns about the integrity of his work.

In contrast, other scientists are making significant strides in understanding complex systems and emergent phenomena. Researchers are exploring new ideas that challenge traditional notions of reality, including the possibility that fundamental laws may have emerged from the vacuum of space.

The debate over creationism versus scientific theory is also ongoing. A recent debate between a Christian creationist and an agnostic scientist highlighted the differences in their perspectives on the origins of life and the natural world.

As we continue to explore the universe and push the boundaries of human knowledge, it's clear that there are many questions still unanswered. But with scientists like Stephen Hawking and others leading the way, we can

Both articles report on multiple gold projects with significant discoveries, but they lack specific details about the companies involved, locations, and drilling results. The language used is also more general and promotional, suggesting that it may be a press release or a marketing piece rather than a genuine news article.  In contrast, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides detailed information about specific drilling operations, including assay results and geological features. It also mentions the companies involved and their projects in a neutral and objective manner. The tone of the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more formal and informative, suggesting that it is a genuine news report rather than a promotional piece.  The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, lacks specific details about the drilling operations and instead focuses on general trends in the gold mining industry. It also uses more sensational language to describe the discoveries, such as ""resurgence"" and ""gold rush."" This suggests that the article is intended to promote a particular narrative or idea rather than provide accurate information.  Overall, while both articles report on similar topics, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE provides more specific and detailed information about the drilling operations, making it more likely to be a genuine news report.","Gold Rush Continues: Multiple Projects Show Promise

The gold mining industry is experiencing a resurgence, with several companies reporting significant discoveries and upgrades to their mineral resources. One of the most promising projects is located in Western Australia, where a Perth-based company has increased its ore reserves by 25% to 480,500 ounces at its Bronzewing Gold Project.

Meanwhile, in West Africa, a Canadian mining corporation has engaged a team to complete a detailed review and update of the geological resource at one of its projects. The updated estimate is expected to provide a better understanding of the geological model and confirm the potential for high-grade mineralization observed in historical drilling.

In Burkina Faso, another company has reported significant gold intercepts from its 15,000-meter drilling program on the Mankarga 5 deposit at its Tanlouka Gold Project. The results include 72 meters of 2.12 grams per tonne gold and highlight the potential for extensions of previously encountered mineralized structures.

In Finland, a company has signed drill contracts for bedrock and lithogeochemical sampling to locate higher-grade gold mineralization on one of its projects. The drilling is expected to start in April and will focus on infill holes along nominal 100-meter spaced lines.

Additionally, a Vancouver-based mining producer has expanded the strike length of mineralization at its San Francisco Gold Mine in Mexico, with intercepts of high gold grades up to 250 meters southwest of the pit. The company's focus remains on West African gold, with several projects showing promise.

These discoveries and upgrades demonstrate the ongoing interest in gold mining and the potential for new discoveries in various regions around the world.","Scientists have made significant discoveries in various fields, shedding new light on the mysteries of our universe.

In a breakthrough drilling operation, a Canadian mining company has extended its Aurizon South gold zone, uncovering high-grade gold, silver, and copper deposits. The latest assay results reveal impressive values, including 263 grams per ton gold over 0.1 meters in one drill hole. This finding is a major milestone for the project, which is located within the company's 100% owned Lac La Hache property in British Columbia.

Meanwhile, a spacecraft designed to orbit an asteroid has captured stunning images of the celestial body's surface. The robot spacecraft, launched four years ago, has provided unprecedented data on the asteroid's composition and geological features. Its high-resolution camera has revealed intricate patterns and textures, offering insights into the asteroid's formation and evolution.

In another development, a team of astronomers has proposed the construction of a massive telescope atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea mountain. The 30-meter telescope would be the largest in the northern hemisphere, capable of studying planets around other stars and peering into the hearts of distant galaxies with unprecedented clarity. However, the project has faced opposition from cultural activists and environmentalists, who argue that it would have an adverse impact on nature and native culture.

In a related field, scientists have made progress in understanding the challenges faced by North Korea's missile program. Experts believe that the nation's difficulties with re-entry vehicles cast doubt on its ability to shield nuclear warheads from heat and vibrations during high-speed flight. While significant hurdles remain, researchers predict that North Korea will eventually develop a workable missile with a reliable warhead.

In the Indian Ocean, scientists have gained access to previously unmapped areas of seafloor as a result of a massive search for a missing plane. The data collected from this endeavor has provided valuable insights into the ocean's geological processes and has shed new light on the region's unique features.

Finally, researchers have discovered that eagles are posing a significant threat to drones in Western Australia. The birds' aggressive behavior has resulted in the loss of several drones, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to mitigate this issue.

These discoveries demonstrate the ongoing efforts of scientists to advance our understanding of the world and the universe around us.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 2 - asteroid orbiter plans a final close-up
the spacecraft was designed to be strictly an orbiting satellite and has no landing gear or other devices for a surface landing, so it has only a slim chance of surviving the attempted soft landing, even at the low speeds it should be traveling before touching the surface. but pictures taken during the final part of the descent should be 5 to 10 times better than any received from near shoemaker to date, dr. farquhar said. the robot spacecraft became the first to orbit an asteroid last feb. 14 when it arrived at eros after a four-year journey from earth. loaded with a camera and five other instruments to determine the mass, density, chemical composition and other characteristics of an asteroid, the craft managed to collect 10 times as much data as originally planned, scientists say. and it established eros as a reference point for guiding future studies of asteroids and comets. scientists have been able to construct detailed models of the shape and size of eros using more than 11 million pulses from a laser measuring instrument and have mapped all the asteroid's cratered, boulder-strewn terrain with 160,000 images taken by near shoemaker. eros is 21 miles long, 8 miles wide and about 8 miles thick, and is variously described as being shaped like a potato or a ballet slipper. the barrel-shaped craft, about the size of a subcompact car, is called near for near earth asteroid rendezvous. it has an array of instruments on one end

Article 3 - giant telescope atop hawaii’s mauna kea should be approved, judge says
the thirty meter telescope, as it is known, would be the largest telescope in the northern hemisphere, with a primary light-gathering mirror 30 meters, or some 100 feet, in diameter. astronomers say it would be able to study planets around other stars and peer into the black-hole hearts of distant galaxies with a clarity exceeding that of the hubble space telescope. photo it is one of three such behemoth telescopes under development worldwide. but the other two, the giant magellan telescope and the european extremely large telescope, are being built in chile and thus will not be able to survey some parts of the universe only visible in the northern sky. mauna kea, hawaii’s tallest mountain, has long been considered the best observatory site in the northern hemisphere and is already home to a passel of large telescopes. it is also a sacred place in hawaiian culture and religion. a coalition of cultural activists and environmentalists has opposed the thirty meter project, citing, among other things, an environmental impact statement that concluded that 30 years of astronomy had had “an adverse effect” on nature and native culture on the mountain. at 18 stories high, the new telescope would be the biggest building on the big island, an industrial-scale installation, opponents say, that would violate the rules for the mountain, which is a special conservation district. in 2015, a groundbreaking for the telescope project was broken up by protesters, who then blockaded the road up the

Article 4 - success of north korean missile test is thrown into question
the findings about the north’s difficulties with a re-entry vehicle came from michael elleman, a missile expert at the international institute for strategic studies in london. he said the malfunction of the warhead as it re-entered the earth’s atmosphere “casts doubt” on the north’s ability to shield a nuclear warhead from the blistering heat and vibrations as it heads to its target at the high speeds that intercontinental ballistic missiles typically achieve. in a news conference on monday, mr. elleman said north korea would have to conduct a minimum of two or three more icbm test flights to make sure its rocket designers have fixed the warhead problem. still, he said, the nation will probably be able to develop a workable missile with a reliable warhead by early next year. that would put the country within the rough time period described in recent american intelligence analyses, which predicted that sometime in 2018 all the technologies needed by the north were likely to come together in a single weapon. fixing the design flaw “might take them another six months,” mr. elleman told reporters on a conference call organized by 38 north, a research institute at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies. “but the key is that they’ll have to do additional flight tests.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree

Article 5 - from flight 370 hunt, new insight into indian ocean’s unknown depths
photo on march 8, 2014, malaysia airlines flight 370 vanished with 239 passengers and crew aboard as it crossed the indian ocean, triggering a large-scale search for its remains that lasted nearly three years. as a byproduct of the tragedy, scientists have gained access to more than 100,000 square miles of seafloor mapped at a level of detail that provides a rare look at the ocean’s geological processes. “it’s an incredible trove of data,” said millard f. coffin, a marine geophysicist from the institute for marine and antarctic studies at the university of tasmania in australia. “i’ve been working in this part of the indian ocean for 30-plus years and over many voyages in the eastern indian ocean i’ve never seen this level of resolution.” dr. coffin worked with a group of about 10 scientists from geoscience australia, the national geosciences agency in australia, to analyze data from the search. they were given access to high-resolution sonar information collected on ships, and data obtained by remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater drones. the information was provided by the australian transport safety bureau, which led the search. “when we look at these data, we’re constantly keeping in mind that we wouldn’t have this data if it weren’t for a terrible tragedy,” dr. coffin said. he and his colleagues published a summary of their findings on wednesday in the journal eos. photo previous satellite data provided

Article 6 - eagles are giving drones a hard time in australia
makieni/123rf it’s fair to say that even the most skilled drone pilot is likely to be no match for a bird of prey that takes a strong dislike to their flying machine. last year, one unlucky drone owner recorded an eagle administering a severe talon “punch” to his drone (below), causing it to fall from the sky. bird attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) recently became a serious issue for gold fields, a mining firm in western australia. the company said it’s lost not one, not even two, but nine drones when disgruntled wedge-tailed eagles made their feelings known by attacking the machines in the sky, downing them in the process. the company told abc news its drones have been targeted by the feathered foe while carrying out work near lake lefroy, about 350 miles east of perth. instead of using multi-rotor copters, gold fields uses a fixed-wing uav with a 100-cm wingspan, similar in design to parrot’s disco drone , aerovironment’s quantix machine , or the one currently being used by zipline to deliver medical supplies in rwanda. made by belgium-based trimble, the ux5 drone is helping gold fields to survey wide areas of land, its built-in camera capturing hd images for computer-generated contouring of mining areas targeted for future work. according to abc news, trimble’s specialized drone, together with its attached camera,

Article 9 - officials set timetable for getting particle collider back on track
for its first year, the collider will operate at 5 trillion electron volts, rather than the design standard of 7 trillion, because that is the highest level for which the magnets have yet been tested. that is still five times the energy of the second-largest accelerator in the world, the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia, ill. much time and energy will be devoted to tuning up the machine and the giant five-story detectors, said dave charlton of the university of birmingham, who works on the atlas detector at cern. “but the new plan to run for up to a year with very few stops gives us a great chance to find new physics sooner,” he said. dark matter, the mysterious substance that astronomers say constitutes 25 percent of the universe, is high on the agenda for the first year. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. a widely popular theory known as supersymmetry posits the existence of a whole new category of matter, known as superparticles. clouds of them could be the mysterious gravitational glue that holds galaxies together. indeed, recent observations from satellites and

Gold Rush Continues: Multiple Projects Show Promise

The gold mining industry is experiencing a resurgence, with several companies reporting significant discoveries and upgrades to their mineral resources. One of the most promising projects is located in Western Australia, where a Perth-based company has increased its ore reserves by 25% to 480,500 ounces at its Bronzewing Gold Project.

Meanwhile, in West Africa, a Canadian mining corporation has engaged a team to complete a detailed review and update of the geological resource at one of its projects. The updated estimate is expected to provide a better understanding of the geological model and confirm the potential for high-grade mineralization observed in historical drilling.

In Burkina Faso, another company has reported significant gold intercepts from its 15,000-meter drilling program on the Mankarga 5 deposit at its Tanlouka Gold Project. The results include 72 meters of 2.12 grams per tonne gold and highlight the potential for extensions of previously encountered mineralized structures.

In Finland, a company has signed drill contracts for bedrock and lithogeochemical sampling to locate higher-grade gold mineralization on one of its projects. The drilling is expected to start in April and will focus on infill holes along nominal 100-meter spaced lines.

Additionally, a Vancouver-based mining producer has expanded the strike length of mineralization at its San Francisco Gold Mine in Mexico, with intercepts of high gold grades up to 250 meters southwest of the pit. The company's focus remains

Scientists have made significant discoveries in various fields, shedding new light on the mysteries of our universe.

In a breakthrough drilling operation, a Canadian mining company has extended its Aurizon South gold zone, uncovering high-grade gold, silver, and copper deposits. The latest assay results reveal impressive values, including 263 grams per ton gold over 0.1 meters in one drill hole. This finding is a major milestone for the project, which is located within the company's 100% owned Lac La Hache property in British Columbia.

Meanwhile, a spacecraft designed to orbit an asteroid has captured stunning images of the celestial body's surface. The robot spacecraft, launched four years ago, has provided unprecedented data on the asteroid's composition and geological features. Its high-resolution camera has revealed intricate patterns and textures, offering insights into the asteroid's formation and evolution.

In another development, a team of astronomers has proposed the construction of a massive telescope atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea mountain. The 30-meter telescope would be the largest in the northern hemisphere, capable of studying planets around other stars and peering into the hearts of distant galaxies with unprecedented clarity. However, the project has faced opposition from cultural activists and environmentalists, who argue that it would have an adverse impact on nature and native culture.

In a related field, scientists have made progress in understanding the challenges faced by North Korea's missile program. Experts believe that the nation's difficulties with re-entry vehicles cast doubt on its ability to shield nuclear warheads from

A series of disturbing incidents has highlighted the darker side of law enforcement and the justice system in the United States. A New York City police officer, Gilberto Valle, was arrested for plotting to kidnap, torture, cook, and eat 100 women. The plot was uncovered after a two-month investigation by the FBI.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, innocent people have been caught up in botched raids gone wrong. In Colorado Springs, a woman suffered a heart attack during a SWAT team raid on her home, while in New Jersey, a family was subjected to a violent and unlawful entry by police officers.

In Oklahoma, a coworker beheaded a female colleague at work, allegedly trying to convert others to Islam. The incident has raised concerns about workplace violence and the dangers of extremist ideologies.

In California, a suspect who had been deported twice before was arrested for a shooting rampage that left two sheriff's deputies dead. The suspect, Luis Bracamonte, had previously been in jail but was released due to immigration issues.

Additionally, there have been reports of hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents, including the poisoning of a black roommate by an 18-year-old white woman in Connecticut.

The justice system has also come under fire for its handling of cases involving police misconduct. A video has surfaced showing a Tennessee jail deputy using pepper spray on a captive who was locked into a device known as the ""devil's chair.""

Article 9 - the greatest financial conspiracy in american history
the greatest financial conspiracy in american history dave hodges the common sense show there is a conspiracy being perpetrated against the american people with regard to the true nature of america’s financial situation. to most people, america appears to be on her last economic legs and the future looks hopeless. on the other hand, america has never been wealthier. however, the wealth has been horded and hidden from the american people. this article exposes why the central bankers and the corporate controlled media are attempting to make it appear as america is dead broke with no hope of recovery. the central bankers, through the government, have indeed hijacked and are hording and hiding substantial assets as they are planning to take the surface economy down as early as this fall/winter. the globalist strategy consists of convincing the people, in advance of the collapse, that there is no hope of economic recovery. under this scenario, the perpetrators of the collapse will meet with less direct resistance, both in the collapse phase and in the recovery phase in which we will all witness the establishment of a world government and a one world economic system. which side is correct? are we broke or do we have substantial hidden assets? both sides are correct. the visible economy, which is obvious to all (e.g. the health of the fiat currency, the unemployment rate, national gdp relative to the planet’s gdp), clearly indicates that a collapse is imminent. however, there is also substantial wealth that is being horded on behalf

Article 1 - the mexican experience: la gran manzana’s homey side
these admittedly unscientific results provide grass-roots insight for anyone planning a mexican weekend in new york. no surprise: of the 10 restaurants getting multiple votes, 9 were nowhere to be found in most guidebooks, including the 2007 zagat restaurant survey. the exception was mamá méxico, with two locations (the upper west side and midtown), which has live mariachi music, a vast menu and an unusually mixed english- and spanish-speaking crowd. it was second, with five votes. the other top three have a lot in common. they are cozy and inexpensive spots outside manhattan, with red-and-green signs, a mexican clientele and a television on which to watch telenovelas and soccer games. they are also all within three blocks of subway stops. the winner (seven votes) was tacos mexico, whose main branch sits beneath the tracks of the no. 7 train in queens. it's bigger than it looks, with a busy bar in the center, and a menu that runs from tacos to bistec a la tampiqueña, a thick-by-mexican-standards steak smothered in peppers and tomatoes and served with refried beans and rice. next was the favorite of bronx mexicans: la estrellita poblana, which had four votes. a bustling, crammed and ultracasual place with two locations, both under elevated tracks. a good sign is that everyone there seems to be eating something different, from

Article 5 - a bronx precinct where killings persist
but ms. torres-gonzalez, who earned a secretarial degree in puerto rico before moving in the 1980s to the bronx, where she taught spanish to children, tried not to be intimidated by such fears. in a building where tenants are often afraid to open their doors for strangers, ms. torres-gonzalez was a confident presence, coaxing neighbors out with food or a favor. since her 77-year-old mother came out of a coma two years ago, ms. torres-gonzalez stayed with her each night, cooking sorullos — fried cornmeal sticks — and helping her get around. during the day, she visited grieving families at nearby hospitals — her own husband died from cancer 20 years ago — and prepared gift boxes for a church group that supported victims of domestic violence. she had been battling lung cancer for about a year but did not tell many people, including her two daughters, because she did not want to burden them. she went to bible study each saturday at a storefront church, ministerio señor y rey, reciting her favorite scripture, jeremiah 29:11: “‘for i know the plans i have for you,’ declares the lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’” “she had a very strong voice,” said carmen martinez, 85, a neighbor, recalling how ms. torres-gonzalez banged on

Article 7 - cuba, si and no
when omar giner left the russian tea room to take over la isla four years ago, the first thing he did was throw out the old menu. not literally; under the previous owners, offerings were scrawled on cardboard and propped against the wall. on the surface, la isla still seems like that kind of place. a faded blue ''restaurant/cafeteria'' sign hangs above the doorway. there are twice as many stools at the counter as there are tables. but mr. giner, a cuban-american from jersey city, isn't interested in appearances. his concern is with putting out copious plates of what he calls ''homespun meets nouveau cuban'' fare. ''i take what's in the cuban diet and reinvent it,'' he said. ''but i do it in such a way that the ingredients don't lose their identity.'' this means that old favorites like media noche -- a sandwich of ham, pork, and swiss cheese on sweet bread ($4) -- and braised pork with fried plantains, black beans and rice ($10.95) share the stage with pan-seared red snapper with a coconut-polenta cake ($17.95). with kicky cuban music and spanish-speaking servers, la isla is full of island soul. by the end of the night, you'll be ready to buy one of the restaurant's black t-shirts with ''cuba'' on the front and ''no!'' on the

Article 9 - scouting the scene
to answer that question, mr. olvera has been doing his homework. as a crucial part of the yearlong windup toward cosme’s scheduled opening in mid-september, he has been visiting popular restaurants around the city, studying what makes them tick, and hitting up successful chefs for offhand advice. he may have a number of hot spots around mexico , but he’s taking nothing for granted. “i’m obviously nervous about it,” he said during an afternoon conversation at maialino, danny meyer ’s roman-style trattoria on gramercy park, where mr. olvera has become a regular. “i know the food world is excited about it. but i don’t know if a regular new yorker even knows who the hell i am, or knows the food i do. i understand that many outsiders have failed in new york. i have analyzed some of the reasons that they have failed, and hopefully we will not make the same mistakes.” stationing mr. olvera at the front door of cosme could be one way to put minds (and appetites) at ease. funny, rumpled, self-effacing, fond of bear hugs and prone to breaking into a goofy conspiratorial grin, he conveys none of the preening hauteur that has hobbled some interlopers. nick anderer, the chef at maialino, described him as “not one of these troubled artists who take themselves way too seriously.” photo

Law Enforcement and Justice System Under Scrutiny

A series of disturbing incidents has highlighted the darker side of law enforcement and the justice system in the United States. A New York City police officer, Gilberto Valle, was arrested for plotting to kidnap, torture, cook, and eat 100 women. The plot was uncovered after a two-month investigation by the FBI.

Meanwhile, in other parts of the country, innocent people have been caught up in botched raids gone wrong. In Colorado Springs, a woman suffered a heart attack during a SWAT team raid on her home, while in New Jersey, a family was subjected to a violent and unlawful entry by police officers.

In Oklahoma, a coworker beheaded a female colleague at work, allegedly trying to convert others to Islam. The incident has raised concerns about workplace violence and the dangers of extremist ideologies.

In California, a suspect who had been deported twice before was arrested for a shooting rampage that left two sheriff's deputies dead. The suspect, Luis Bracamonte, had previously been in jail but was released due to immigration issues.

Additionally, there have been reports of hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents, including the poisoning of a black roommate by an 18-year-old white woman in Connecticut.

The justice system has also come under fire for its handling of cases involving police misconduct. A video has surfaced showing a Tennessee jail deputy using pepper spray on a captive who was locked into a device known as the ""devil's chair.""

The language used is also consistent with reputable news sources, such as the use of technical terms like ""troubled assets"" and ""regulatory power."" In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE contains several red flags, including unsubstantiated claims about a ""secret bailout"" and an exaggerated figure of $1.2 trillion in taxpayer money handed out to banks. Additionally, the article's tone is sensationalized and lacks the nuance and balance typically found in reputable news reporting. Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE appears to be the most accurate and trustworthy source of information on this topic.","Federal Reserve's Secret Bailout Revealed

A recent Freedom of Information Act request has uncovered a shocking truth about the Federal Reserve's actions during the 2008 financial crisis. Contrary to public knowledge, the Fed handed out over $1.2 trillion in taxpayer money to struggling banks, including Morgan Stanley, which suddenly announced it had ""strong capital and liquidity positions"" just days before.

This revelation raises questions about the lack of congressional oversight and the Fed's unilateral decision-making during this critical period. The figure is significantly higher than the widely publicized $700 billion bailout pushed through Congress at the same time.

Meanwhile, a prominent congresswoman has been facing scrutiny over potential ethics violations. Black leaders have rallied around her, citing a pattern of similar investigations targeting members of the Congressional Black Caucus. This highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in government.

In other news, a new finance bill has been passed, but critics argue it does little to address the root causes of the crisis. Goldman Sachs has struck a deal with federal prosecutors to pay $550 million to settle claims of misleading investors, sparking concerns about the firm's influence and power.

As the economy continues to recover, some experts are warning about the dangers of inflation and the Federal Reserve's actions. The Fed has promised to buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month, which could exacerbate existing problems.

In a related development, a prominent senator has expressed disappointment over a compromise that threatened his landmark legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. This bill aims to restore transparency and accountability to the central bank.

Finally, a Kansas City Fed president has criticized the Fed's policies, citing concerns about quantitative easing and its impact on the economy. The Fed has responded by implementing new rules to limit criticism from officials.

These developments highlight the need for greater scrutiny and oversight of the Federal Reserve and government agencies. As the economy continues to evolve, it is essential that we prioritize transparency and accountability to ensure a more equitable recovery for all.","US Banks to Repay Bailout Funds, but at What Cost?

The US government is set to allow banks to repay bailout funds, a move that could bring relief to taxpayers. However, the process poses significant risks, including the potential for bank failures and the ceding of regulatory power.

Industry analysts estimate that US banks hold over $2 trillion in troubled assets, which must be purchased by the government or repaid by the banks themselves. The Treasury Department plans to leverage private investors to buy up these assets, but the details have been difficult to agree upon.

The Federal Reserve has identified a group of banks ready to exit the bailout program, with regulators refusing to let any single institution leave first. However, this move could lead to significant challenges in commercial real estate and credit cards.

Banks are eager to extricate themselves from heightened government oversight, including restrictions on employee compensation. The Treasury Secretary has sought to calm investor jitters about the financial health of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The bailout program has been criticized for benefiting Wall Street at the expense of ordinary citizens. Economists argue that the US government's response to the crisis has been inadequate, with many calling for significant reforms.

As banks prepare to repay bailout funds, regulators must balance the need to return taxpayer money with the risks of allowing institutions to operate without adequate oversight. The outcome is far from certain, and the consequences could be severe if not managed carefully.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(before it's news) editor’s note: in light of the goldman theft detailed yesterday, we are reposting this story as part of our look back at the goldman aig taxpayer heist. – geithner smiles but won’t talk about mystery man, former goldman sachs executive turned lead treasury aig negotiator dan jester. the hank paulson stories from earlier got me thinking again about dan jester. this piece by william cohan is a good starting point. more coming. by lehman author william d. cohan now that we have pulled back sufficiently far from the near “destruction of the modern financial system” — as the former treasury secretary henry paulson described the events of 2008 in his new memoir, “on the brink” — to focus on how to prevent such a calamity from recurring, the time has come to hear from those players in the drama who really know what happened and why. until people such as warren spector, the former co-president and head of the fixed-income division at bear stearns, and dan jester, a mysterious former goldman sachs banker turned treasury official — among many others — come forward and share with us the roles they played before, during and after the crisis, there is little hope that the members of congress working on financial

Article 6 - bernanke’s hypocrisy knows no bounds
bernanke’s hypocrisy knows no bounds (before it's news) ben bernanke’s hypocrisy was on full display yesterday as he chided congress over a variety of fiscal policy matters. “i only ask … as congress looks at the timing and composition of its changes to the budget, that it does take into account that in the very near term the recovery is still rather fragile, and that sharp and excessive cuts in the very short term would be potentially damaging to that recovery.” the fed chairman, who has on numerous occasions told congress not to interfere in monetary policy, “warned congress on excessive budget deficits, warned congress on reducing deficits too quickly, and warned congress about not hiking the debt ceiling,” according to mike “mish” shedlock, author of mish’s global economic trend analysis. mish – a long-time critic of the federal reserve and bernanke in particular – went on to say that “after bitching and moaning on numerous occasions about congress interfering in monetary policy, bernanke repeatedly plunges headlong into fiscal policy, hoping to place the blame for the next collapse on anyone other than the fed.” while congress clearly deserves its fair share of the blame for the united states’ economic problems, so does the federal reserve. the fact that the most fervent supporter of money printing in the history of mankind is lecturing others on fiscal responsibility illustrates the severity of bernanke’s hypocrisy and ego. he is just another can-kicking advocate who refuses to acknowledge the structural problems in the economy

Article 7 - $$40 billion a month in mortgage bonds
$$40 billion a month in mortgage bonds % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the federal reserve has chosen inflation of the us dollar through the creation of more valueless dollars. to top it off they have promised to buy $$40 billion a month of mortgage bonds and $$85 billion a month of us treasury securities. from wapo: the federal reserve under chairman ben bernanke is trying to help the economy by doing something president barack obama and congress can’t and which mitt romney opposes: electronically creating money, mostly out of thin air. the fed says it will “buy” $$40 billion a month in mortgage bonds until stubbornly high unemployment eases substantially. the fed’s new move is on top of its $$85 billion-a-month purchases of treasury securities under an existing program. it hopes to hold down long-term interest rates long enough to stimulate more private-sector borrowing and hiring. democrats generally welcomed the step, although obama’s camp won’t comment on fed actions. republicans called it further confirmation that obama’s policies are failing. “the president’s saying the economy’s making progress, coming back. bernanke’s saying, ‘no, it’s not. i’ve got to print more money,’” romney told abc.” today, with all of everyone’s attention on the mobs in the middle east, it seems that few are paying attention to the recent announcement by fed chairman bernanke. he is blatantly playing

Article 8 - the new finance bill: a mountain of legislative paper, a molehill of reform
the new finance bill: a mountain of legislative paper, a molehill of reform (before it's news) courtesy of robert reich thursday the president pronounced that “because of this [financial reform] bill the american people will never again be asked to foot the bill for wall street’s mistakes.” as if to prove him wrong, goldman sachs simultaneously announced it had struck a deal with federal prosecutors to pay $$550 million to settle federal claims it misled investor — a sum representing a mere 15 days profit for the firm based on its 2009 earnings. goldman’s share price immediately jumped 4.3 percent, and the street proclaimed its chair and ceo, lloyd (“goldman is doing god’s work”) blankfein, a winner. financial analysts rushed to affirm a glowing outlook for goldman stock. blankfein, you may recall, was at the meeting in late 2008 when tim geithner and hank paulson decided to bail out aig, and thereby deliver through aig a $$13 billion no-strings-attached taxpayer windfall to goldman. in a world where money is the measure of everything, blankfein’s power and influence have grown. presumably, goldman can expect more windfalls in future years. although the financial reform bill may have clipped some of goldman’s wings — its lucrative derivative business may require goldman to jettison its status as a bank holding company, and the access to the fed discount

Article 1 - toxic asset plan foresees big subsidies for investors
industry analysts estimate that the nation’s banks are holding at least $2 trillion in troubled assets, mostly residential and commercial mortgages. the plan to be announced next week involves three separate approaches. in one, the federal deposit insurance corporation will set up special-purpose investment partnerships and lend about 85 percent of the money that those partnerships will need to buy up troubled assets that banks want to sell. in the second, the treasury will hire four or five investment management firms, matching the private money that each of the firms puts up on a dollar-for-dollar basis with government money. in the third piece, the treasury plans to expand lending through the term asset-backed securities loan facility, a joint venture with the federal reserve. photo the goal of the plan is to leverage the dwindling resources of the treasury department’s bailout program with money from private investors to buy up as many of those toxic assets as possible and free the banks to resume more normal lending. but the details have been treacherously difficult, politically and financially, and some of the big decisions are the same as those that bedeviled the treasury department under president george w. bush last year. timothy f. geithner, the treasury secretary, provoked scathing criticism from investors in february by announcing the broad outlines of the plan without addressing the tough questions, like how the government planned to share the risk with investors or arrive at a fair price for the assets that would neither cheat taxpayers nor harm the banks. advertisement continue reading the main story

Article 2 - paulson and bernanke seek reforms
the fed’s financial backing of jpmorgan chase’s takeover of the troubled bear stearns has drawn criticism from democrats, who call it a government bailout that could put billions of taxpayer dollars at risk. both democrats and republicans lawmakers said changes need to be made to protect taxpayers in the future should another big firm get into trouble. representative spencer bachus, republican of alabama, said a “shock absorber” is needed to make sure that “taxpayers are not holding the bag, adding, “this is a tall order.” the committee’s chairman, representative barney frank, a massachusetts democrat, suggested that it was more important for congress to “do it right” rather than acting quickly on substantial legislative changes. mr. bernanke and mr. paulson agreed with that assessment. “realistically it is going to be difficult to get things done this year,” mr. paulson acknowledged. the treasury chief also sought thursday to calm investor jitters about the financial health of mortgage giants, fannie mae and freddie mac. they are “working through this challenging period,” mr. paulson told congress. “their regulator has made clear that they are adequately capitalized.” shares of fannie and freddie tumbled on monday after a lehman brothers report said that an accounting change could force the companies to raise billions in new capital. that sent a tremor through financial markets. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not

Article 3 - what happened to regulatory reform?
nearly two years ago, as a presidential candidate, barack obama gave a stirring speech at cooper union in new york about the need to reform the country’s financial system. joseph e. stiglitz, the nobel-winning economist, recalls it fondly in his powerful new book, “freefall: america, free markets, and the sinking of the world economy” (norton, $27.95). but mr. stiglitz laments that the president failed to make good on such soaring rhetoric. he argues that mr. obama has continued for the most part to pursue the failed policies of george w. bush. this, in the economist’s view, has benefited wall street but has done little for ordinary citizens. the results speak for themselves, mr. stiglitz says. he worries that “the best that can be said for the economy was that by the fall of 2009 it seems to be at the end of a freefall, a decline without an end in sight. but the end of freefall is not the same as a return to normalcy.” that raises a question: how is it that mr. obama the candidate understood the need for economic reform while mr. obama the president became a defender of the status quo in many unexpected ways? mr. stiglitz, a former chief economist at the world bank who spent time in the white house as an adviser to president bill clinton, thinks he knows

Article 4 - bad banks, big bailouts and bruises
yet mr. barofsky goes on to say that he did not really think that mr. allison was threatening him; in fact, mr. allison “was, in a very washington way, sincerely trying to be helpful.” this introductory episode not only sets the book’s tone, but it also embodies the contradictions and inconsistencies throughout mr. barofsky’s account. he writes early on that “i had no idea that the u.s. government had been captured by the banks,” and at another point describes his strategy to use the press to get the attention of congress, and by extension an obstreperous treasury: “our message was simple: treasury’s desperate attempt to bail out wall street was setting the country up for potentially catastrophic losses.” yet despite such repeated condemnations of the decision-making process in both the bush and obama administrations, mr. barofsky never really concedes that the predicted losses did not occur. he refers throughout to the $700 billion bailout, never clarifying that less than $300 billion of that amount went out the door by the time tarp expired; that not a penny went to big banks during the obama administration; and that those banks repaid taxpayers with interest. photo as ugly and flawed as the rescue process was, and as galling as wall street’s revived bravado and bonuses can be to most americans, the fact remains that an economic collapse was averted, and that main street is recovering: slowly, but typically so for

Article 5 - goldman sachs poised for return to power in trump white house
new york — government sachs is returning to washington. after a decade in the wilderness, wall street’s most powerful firm, goldman sachs, is dominating the early days of the incoming trump administration. the newly picked treasury secretary, steven mnuchin, spent 17 years at goldman. trump’s top incoming white house adviser, steve bannon, spent his early career at the bank. so did anthony scaramucci, one of trump’s top transition advisers. goldman’s president, gary cohn, spent an hour schmoozing with president-elect donald trump on tuesday and could be up for an administration job, possibly as director of the office of management and budget, people close to cohn and the transition said. cohn, a long-time commodities trader, is friendly with trump’s powerful son-in-law, jared kushner. it’s a stunning reversal of fortune for goldman, a long-time washington power that fell out of favor following the financial crisis. ceo lloyd blankfein got hauled before congress along with other wall street executives to account for their behavior. and trump, who ran as a populist and bashed wall street on the campaign trail, featured blankfein as a shady and dangerous character in his final campaign ad. rolling stone’s matt taibbi famously labeled goldman the “great vampire squid” on the face of america. had hillary clinton won the white house, goldman faced a

Article 6 - mutual funds report; a scandal, but business booms
putnam had a net outflow of $11.1 billion from its stock funds in november, while $2.2 billion was withdrawn from janus capital's stock funds, according to figures compiled by amg data services in arcata, calif. it is not clear whether that bleeding accelerated or ebbed last month because neither company has reported its numbers for december yet. but most of that money appears to have gone into stock funds managed by other big fund companies, like fidelity investments and vanguard group, rather than into bonds, cash or individual stocks. evidence is scant that investors have lost their faith in actively managed funds. specialists in the behavior of investors cited several reasons for the muted reaction, but one stands out over all: the stock market has been on a tear. ''behaviorists like me say it's not that individual investors never learn, it's just that they learn very, very slowly,'' said hersh m. shefrin, a professor of finance at santa clara university in california. in a rising market, when the value of their holdings is growing, investors tend to focus on the positive and filter out negative news. only when the market is swooning do they look for somebody, like a broker or fund manager, to blame for their misfortune, mr. shefrin said. ''it takes a down market to generate traction, when investors have a very strong need to feel that what's happened is not their fault,'' he said. ''that's when

Article 7 - u.s. weighs how to let banks give money back
new details emerged tuesday about the repayment plans, including word that regulators would refuse to let a single major bank exit first, which might have given that institution considerable bragging rights. instead, around june 8, the federal reserve expects to identify a group of banks that are ready to leave the bailout program, according to a federal reserve official, who was granted anonymity because of the fed’s policy against speaking publicly on such matters. the treasury department will handle the timing of the payments, this person said. many ordinary americans, angered by multibillion-dollar bailouts and what they see as excessive pay in the financial industry, might welcome news that taxpayers will get their money back sooner rather than later. but repaying the bailouts is not without risk. while many big banks have, for the moment, stanched crippling losses, the banking industry still faces significant challenges. new troubles loom in commercial real estate and credit cards. by letting banks return bailout money, the government would cede some power over institutions that were at the center of the financial crisis. banks, for their part, are eager to extricate themselves from heightened government oversight, including restrictions on their employees’ compensation. “if a given bank repays the money and then in october, it needs the money again, that is going to be very scary,” said douglas j. elliott, a fellow at the brookings institution and a former banker at jpmorgan chase. bank chiefs have said for

Article 8 - pitiful, helpless giant
mayer argues that greenspan probably has less control over the engines of credit than any fed chairman in history -- simply because banks, whose cost of funds the fed can influence, have lost their primacy as suppliers of credit to american business. they have been largely supplanted by the financial markets, which have a will of their own when it comes to the cost of borrowed money. and what it takes to influence the financial markets these days, in mayer's shrewd estimation, is a little magic and a lot of sunshine. he gives greenspan a round of applause for the ''prestidigitation'' that helped calm global markets after russia defaulted on its debt in august 1998. he also gives greenspan credit for realizing that the fed's obsessive secrecy about its interest-rate deliberations could not survive in the information age. but mayer asks some serious, long overdue questions about whether the culture and internal architecture of the federal reserve system can successfully handle the new role the institution was given by congress in 1999. when it officially repealed the depression-era law that barred banks from the securities industry, congress designated the fed as the ''umbrella supervisor'' of the ''financial holding companies'' that make up most of the american financial services industry. in the arm-wrestling of official washington, it was a breathtaking triumph for the fed, and it came as most other nations were actually diminishing the regulatory role of their central banks, mayer points out. newsletter sign up continue

Article 9 - breakingviews: what trump’s victory might mean for banks
by antony currie and dominic elliott nov. 9, 2016 continue reading the main story donald j. trump ’s surprise election victory should bring some welcome relief to banks. a republican party in control of congress also usually appeals to the financial markets. the president-elect’s erratic positions on other important issues, however, could turn those short-term gains into long-term pain. bank stocks rallied early wednesday after investors learned that mr. trump was set to become america’s 45th president. as with britain’s vote in june to leave the european union , gyrations in government debt and currency markets could mean brisk business for traders of bonds, currencies and commodities. a commitment to spending on american roads and bridges, reinforced in mr. trump’s victory speech, is also a good sign for wall street. a repeal or significant reform of dodd-frank, president obama’s 2010 law reining in banks after the financial crisis, is more likely, too, and may help the bottom line of financial institutions. the next treasury secretary, securities and exchange commission chairman and head of supervision at the federal reserve also could be friendlier to the industry. higher interest rates would be an additional benefit, and mr. trump has supported the idea. a one percentage-point increase could add billions of dollars to the top line of the biggest american lenders within a year and act as yet another stimulus to the trading desks of banks like jpmorgan chase , goldman

Article 10 - wells fargo’s big dilemma
that’s because selling new common stock and being shareholder-friendly are not entirely mutually exclusive. paying back the relief funds would extinguish $1.25 billion a year in post-tax dividends, freeing up earnings for common shareholders. wells could issue up to $8.8 billion in stock without reducing the earnings per share available to current holders, according to jpmorgan. doing that and repaying the rest of the funds in cash would put a 9 percent floor under wells’ tier 1 ratio. the slug of new common stock would also raise the narrower tier 1 common equity ratio to 6 percent from the current 5.2 percent, which is three percentage points below the bank’s two bailout-free peers. those improved ratios still appear skinny. but wells set aside an extra cushion against loan losses when it bought wachovia. that’s worth another 1.5 percentage points on both capital ratios. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. squaring the circle this way would call for careful explanation. should mr. stumpf decide to do it, though, he has no problem speaking up. call it socialism here’s

Federal Reserve's Secret Bailout Revealed

A recent Freedom of Information Act request has uncovered a shocking truth about the Federal Reserve's actions during the 2008 financial crisis. Contrary to public knowledge, the Fed handed out over $1.2 trillion in taxpayer money to struggling banks, including Morgan Stanley, which suddenly announced it had ""strong capital and liquidity positions"" just days before.

This revelation raises questions about the lack of congressional oversight and the Fed's unilateral decision-making during this critical period. The figure is significantly higher than the widely publicized $700 billion bailout pushed through Congress at the same time.

Meanwhile, a prominent congresswoman has been facing scrutiny over potential ethics violations. Black leaders have rallied around her, citing a pattern of similar investigations targeting members of the Congressional Black Caucus. This highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in government.

In other news, a new finance bill has been passed, but critics argue it does little to address the root causes of the crisis. Goldman Sachs has struck a deal with federal prosecutors to pay $550 million to settle claims of misleading investors, sparking concerns about the firm's influence and power.

As the economy continues to recover, some experts are warning about the dangers of inflation and the Federal Reserve's actions. The Fed has promised to buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month, which could exacerbate existing problems.

In a related development, a prominent senator has expressed disappointment over a compromise that threatened his landmark legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. This bill

US Banks to Repay Bailout Funds, but at What Cost?

The US government is set to allow banks to repay bailout funds, a move that could bring relief to taxpayers. However, the process poses significant risks, including the potential for bank failures and the ceding of regulatory power.

Industry analysts estimate that US banks hold over $2 trillion in troubled assets, which must be purchased by the government or repaid by the banks themselves. The Treasury Department plans to leverage private investors to buy up these assets, but the details have been difficult to agree upon.

The Federal Reserve has identified a group of banks ready to exit the bailout program, with regulators refusing to let any single institution leave first. However, this move could lead to significant challenges in commercial real estate and credit cards.

Banks are eager to extricate themselves from heightened government oversight, including restrictions on employee compensation. The Treasury Secretary has sought to calm investor jitters about the financial health of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The bailout program has been criticized for benefiting Wall Street at the expense of ordinary citizens. Economists argue that the US government's response to the crisis has been inadequate, with many calling for significant reforms.

As banks prepare to repay bailout funds, regulators must balance the need to return taxpayer money with the risks of allowing institutions to operate without adequate oversight. The outcome is far from certain, and the consequences could be severe if not managed carefully.

As the United States continues to grapple with internal tensions and external threats, concerns are growing about the potential for martial law and the abuse of presidential power. In recent years, there have been several instances where the government has taken drastic measures to maintain control, often without congressional approval or public debate.

Some critics argue that President Obama's actions during his eight-year tenure in office were a precursor to these measures. His use of executive orders and disregard for constitutional authority have raised eyebrows among some lawmakers and citizens. In fact, a recent report revealed that more than half of active-duty troops held an unfavorable opinion of the former president.

The issue has sparked debate about the limits of presidential power and the role of Congress in overseeing the executive branch. Some argue that the President's actions are a threat to democracy and individual freedoms, while others see them as necessary measures to maintain national security.

In addition to concerns over martial law, there are also worries about the potential for foreign intervention. A recent report suggested that the United Nations is preparing to impose its own brand of control on the US, with troops from around the world operating under a UN flag.

As the country navigates these complex issues, it's essential to remember that the Constitution is in place to protect individual rights and freedoms. Any measures taken by the government must be carefully considered and subject to public debate and oversight.

Ultimately, the fate of democracy in America hangs in the balance. Will the government continue to prioritize its own interests over those of the people, or will there be a renewed focus on protecting individual liberties? Only time will tell.","A Looming Threat to Civil Liberties: The Legacy of Presidential Power

As the United States transitions from one administration to another, a pressing concern remains: the unchecked power of the presidency. Critics argue that the current president-elect's approach to national security will only exacerbate this issue.

The previous administration's expansion of executive authority has set a concerning precedent. Drone strikes and military interventions without congressional oversight have become increasingly common. This trend is particularly alarming given the lack of transparency and accountability in such operations.

Moreover, the detention of American citizens without trial or charges has raised serious concerns about the rule of law. The Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold this practice highlights the need for greater scrutiny of executive power.

The legacy of George W. Bush's policies also casts a long shadow. His use of ""free-fire zones"" in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted in civilian casualties and widespread destruction. The subsequent administration's attempts to justify these actions as necessary for national defense only serve to underscore the dangers of unchecked presidential power.

As the new administration takes office, it is essential that Congress reasserts its authority and ensures that executive branch actions are subject to meaningful oversight. The fate of civil liberties hangs in the balance, and it is up to lawmakers to prevent a repeat of the abuses seen under previous administrations.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

(before it's news) in paris right now, they are under a state of martial law. is that what you want here? a “legalized” version of emperor obama? you need to understand that if a devastating attack goes off here like the one in paris, and martial law is implemented, the u.s. constitution is immediately “suspended.” in other words, you would suddenly have no rights at all. there would be no freedom of speech, no freedom of the press, no freedom of assembly and you could be arrested at any time for any reason whatsoever. for the duration of the “martial law”, the military would be in control, and remember who is commander in chief. there would be troops in the streets, a curfew would almost certainly be imposed, and armed checkpoints would be set up. there is no debate: those are the facts. no more talk, time for action! the time to make a stand against barack obama has finally come. for seven years we’ve repeatedly heard, “oh, obama will never be able to do that, the people will stop him,” and no one has even lifted a finger much less stop him, but here and now, unless we want what happened in paris happening on our doorsteps, killing our children, then the rubber has finally met the road, and the time to act has come. much of what i am

Article 2 - watch: if you don’t love this video of the navy and marines, you don’t love america
(angry patriot) – our military makes us beam with pride. there’s nothing quite like seeing our brave service men and women in action — and the vast might of the united states. our dedicated armed forces can accomplish anything — even with one of the most anti-military presidents in the history of our republic in the oval office. yep, this video was created during the obama regime, and these brave men and women never slacked on their training even with a socialist in the white house! the united states navy and marine corps does far more than showcase the expertise of our fighting men and women. it shows our enemies the stunning might of our naval fleet, fighter planes, helicopters, and tanks. barack obama was laser-focused on dismantling the american military during his eight year in office. he nearly accomplished his treasonous goal. as wnd notes, dhs officer philip haney firmly stated obama did not do his duty to protect we the people from terrorism while in office. he ignored real threats from not only radical islamic terrorists but from russia, north korea, and china as well. obama deeply slashed the budget of the united states armed forces. a military times report revealed more than half of active duty troops held an unfavorable opinion of the former president, and they would be in a position to know the full impact of his dereliction of duty. our military is now at pre-world war ii staffing levels. we had more warships before defeating hitler

Article 3 - {video} democrat congressman calls for martial law over #ferguson
(the daily caller) — georgia rep. john lewis (d) has called on president obama to declare martial law in ferguson, mo. the congressman made the public call thursday afternoon as protesters continue to clash with police in ferguson after a cop shot and killed unarmed black teen michael brown saturday night. (related: is this america? stunning photos from violent protests in ferguson, mo.) “people have a right to protest,” lewis said on msnbc. “they have a right to dissent. they have a right to march in an orderly, peaceful, non-violent fashion. and the press has a right to cover it. ferguson, mo. is not the congo. it is not china. it is not russia. we can do better.” “president obama should use the authority of his office to declare martial law,” he continued. “federalize the missouri national guard to protect people as they protest.”

Article 4 - obama plans to declare martial law to keep trump out of the white house?
president barack obama’s time in office has been fodder for conspiracy theorists since he stepped into the white house eight years ago, with critics questioning his place of birth and religion, among other things. now that republican donald trump will be filling obama’s seat in the oval office, some conspiracy theorists are certain the president will declare martial law to extend his own term and keep trump out of office. and some anti-trump americans are applauding the idea. martial law refers to government control through the use of military force. the conspiracy developed from those who perceived obama’s occassional use of executive orders as an overreach of his power. the president doesn’t need approval for executive orders and they can’t be overturned by congress. obama has signed 256 executive orders as of october, compared with george w. bush’s 291 and bill clinton’s 634. his orders have never created martial law.

Article 5 - obama’s motivation for martial law implementation
obama’s motivation for martial law implementation headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! obama’s motivation for martial law implementation if you’ve ever wondered what martial law in america may look like, then this detailed report will be an eye opener. it explores the ramifications of our current economic and political climate, motivating factors that necessitate a lock-down of america by the-powers-that-be, the signs to look for before it happens, implementation, and your life once troops have been deployed. america has gone from being annoyed with their government to the point of resisting their government. in my previous article, i have detailed how state governors, veterans, truckers and just average everyday citizens are resisting the tyrannical and egregious abrogation’s of the united states constitution. the police state crackdown mechanisms are in place which are designed to break the back of any resistance to federal authority, legitimate or not. the net effect of the establishment of “police state america” is that it is designed to subjugate the populace and stamp out any remaining vestiges of constitutional liberties and create a society where the state is all-powerful. with america’s new found spirit of civil liberty being expressed through acts of civil disobedience, martial law is being put into place. when one couples this undeniable fact with the fact that president obama is under extreme pressure and is struggling to maintain control of the country, these measures are going to be rolled in a style reminiscent of the shock and awe

Article 6 - should obama be detained for violating the ndaa?
should obama be detained for violating the ndaa? % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) if president obama is supporting al-qaeda, the taliban, or associated forces, should he be subject to indefinite detention under the terms of the national defense authorization act (ndaa)? as the new american has chronicled since it was first proposed, the ndaa purportedly authorizes the president of the united states to deploy the armed forces to apprehend and indefinitely detain anyone suspected of providing support to terrorists. section 1021 of the ndaa reads in relevant part: congress affirms that the authority of the president to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to the authorization for use of military force (public law 107-40; 50 u.s.c.1541 note) includes the authority for the armed forces of the united states to detain covered persons (as defined in subsection (b)) pending disposition under the law of war. a covered person under this section is any person as follows: a person who was a part of or substantially supported al-qaeda, the taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the united states or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces. and, finally: detention under the law of war without trial until the end of the hostilities authorized by the authorization

Article 7 - libya: another war on the middle east
libya: another war on the middle east (before it's news) u.s. president barack obama, winner of the nobel peace prize, has launched another war in the middle east against a country that had neither attacked, nor even threatened the united states of america. this time it’s libya. he did so without meaningful public debate, congressional approval, or constitutional authority too. like his predecessor george w. bush and many presidents before him, president obama went to war solely by his own accord, disregarding article i, section 8′s assignment of the power “to declare war” to congress altogether. consider what candidate barack obama said about this matter back in 2008: the president does not have power under the constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation. but there’s no point in extensively quoting political hypocrisies, or even kidding ourselves about the constitutionality of actions taken by our washington, dc overlords. because the reality is that, as joseph sobran infamously said, “the constitution poses no threat to our current form of government.” the u.s.-lobbied u.n. security council resolution authorizing military force in libya does not compel u.s. involvement either. it is merely an excuse for the president to send american boys and girls off to die in a war that has nothing to do with their own interests

Article 8 - the un is preparing to impose martial law on the us
the un is preparing to impose martial law on the us (before it's news) dave hodges the common sense show june 26, 2014 not on my watch! i have been writing that my military sources tell me that their greatest fears are beginning to become realized because the united states will be, in the relatively near future, this country will be under martial law and the bulk of the occupation force will be comprised by foreign troops operating under the flag of the united nations. under the heading, “hiding in plain sight”, the united nations is advertising for the following position: posting title: disarmament, demobilization and reintegration officer, p4 job title code: disarmament, demobilibation and reintegration officer department/office: department of peacekeeping operations duty station: new york job description: a minimum of seven years of progressively responsible experience in disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration or related area. experience working within peacekeeping, peace-building or development programmes operations is desirable. experience with small arms control, conflict/post-conflict crisis management, economic recovery is desirable. experience coordinating multiple partner agencies, funds or programmes is desirable. analysis of the job description peacekeeping is normally the euphemism reserved for gun confiscation and population subjugation. if there is any doubt to the veracity of this claim, the following phrase “experience with small arms control“, should remove any doubt as to what is coming. further this job description uses phrases such

Article 9 - breaking: another obama flip flop, sending us combat troops to fight isis
after proclaiming isis the “jv team” and insisting it is no threat, obama is now all of a sudden reversing himself and demanding that congress give him a stronger authorization for the use of military force (aumf) to fight isis. he is now even asking for boots on the ground, something he has always said he’d never do. obama has been resisting the idea of sending actual combat troops to the area to fight isis because for years now he’s claimed that he had defeated terrorism. but now obama is asking for permission for limited combat operations here is what obama asked for today: the authorization i propose would provide the flexibility to conduct ground combat operations in other more limited circumstances, such as rescue operations involving u.s. or coalition personnel or the use of special operations forces to take military action against isil leadership… boots on the ground!!

Article 10 - obama says his critics are a bigger threat than radical islam (video)
obama says his critics are a bigger threat than radical islam (video) % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) will somebody please slap a straight jacket on this idiot until he can be tried, convicted, and hung for treason before anyone else gets killed as a result of his failed policies? please! my god! in orlando, fla., president obama referred to donald trump’s recent claim that more lives could have been saved at pulse if more patrons were armed themselves. such a notion “defies common sense,” he said, without naming trump. you read that right: forty-nine people dead and dozens more severely injured, but obama wanted everybody to imagine how much worse the carnage might have been if somebody had been carrying a gun for self defense: obama: this debate needs to change. it’s outgrown the old political stalemates. the notion that the answer to this tragedy would be to make sure that more people in a nightclub are similarly armed to the killer defies common sense. is the president saying victims of omar mateen’s rampage would have somehow been less safe if some clubgoers had been carrying a means to defend themselves? that simply, well, defies common sense. but we’re used to it from this president. earlier in the week, dr. sebastian gorka really let the obama administration have it during an interview on fox news with maria bartiromo

Article 1 - barack obama will hand donald trump a sweeping ability to wage war without oversight
barack obama will hand donald trump a sweeping ability to wage war without oversight the notoriously unpredictable president-elect will soon decide who to target with drone strikes. 11/17/2016 06:55 pm et jessica schulberg foreign affairs reporter, the huffington post jim watson/getty images the expansive authority president barack obama has claimed to wage war will soon be passed on to president-elect trump. washington ― president barack obama entered office in 2009 with the promise of reining in his predecessor’s freewheeling use of military force abroad. but rather than rolling back the authorities former president george w. bush exercised, obama has expanded some of his most controversial national security programs ― such as the drone program and conducting warfare without specific congressional authorization. while there were cases where obama reversed bush-era policies, critics say he often did so with minimal transparency and accountability. obama has set a precedent for the next commander-in-chief to claim even greater unilateral authority on the use of force. in two months, he will hand off an empowered executive branch to donald trump , a man he has described as lacking the temperament, experience and values to lead the country. here are some of the ways he has expanded the presidential prerogative to wage war: drones a key part of the bush administration’s “war on terror” involved using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with hellfire missiles to quietly kill suspected enemies without formally going to war with

to the editor: re ''the rule of law and the war on terror,'' by ruth wedgwood (op-ed, dec. 23), attacking the ruling of a federal appeals court that jose padilla, an american citizen, is entitled to a criminal trial: mr. padilla's detention is no longer about safety; it is about interrogation. the president claims that he has the right to seize any american citizen, hold him indefinitely and apply psychological pressure until the citizen cracks and tells his captors what the president wants to hear. furthermore, the president argues that no court should be able to review his actions, under any circumstances. it is hard to imagine a more direct attack on the rule of law. ms. wedgwood's invocation of the sept. 11 attacks is misleading. nothing in the court's ruling would prevent any president from acting to protect the united states from real danger. the second circuit court of appeals deserves praise for upholding the ideals that we cherish. tobias barrington wolff palo alto, calif., dec. 23, 2003 the writer is visiting professor of law at stanford law school.

Concerns Over Martial Law and Presidential Power

As the United States continues to grapple with internal tensions and external threats, concerns are growing about the potential for martial law and the abuse of presidential power. In recent years, there have been several instances where the government has taken drastic measures to maintain control, often without congressional approval or public debate.

Some critics argue that President Obama's actions during his eight-year tenure in office were a precursor to these measures. His use of executive orders and disregard for constitutional authority have raised eyebrows among some lawmakers and citizens. In fact, a recent report revealed that more than half of active-duty troops held an unfavorable opinion of the former president.

The issue has sparked debate about the limits of presidential power and the role of Congress in overseeing the executive branch. Some argue that the President's actions are a threat to democracy and individual freedoms, while others see them as necessary measures to maintain national security.

In addition to concerns over martial law, there are also worries about the potential for foreign intervention. A recent report suggested that the United Nations is preparing to impose its own brand of control on the US, with troops from around the world operating under a UN flag.

As the country navigates these complex issues, it's essential to remember that the Constitution is in place to protect individual rights and freedoms. Any measures taken by the government must be carefully considered and subject to public debate and oversight.

Ultimately, the fate of democracy in America hangs in the balance. Will the government continue to prioritize its

A Looming Threat to Civil Liberties: The Legacy of Presidential Power

As the United States transitions from one administration to another, a pressing concern remains: the unchecked power of the presidency. Critics argue that the current president-elect's approach to national security will only exacerbate this issue.

The previous administration's expansion of executive authority has set a concerning precedent. Drone strikes and military interventions without congressional oversight have become increasingly common. This trend is particularly alarming given the lack of transparency and accountability in such operations.

Moreover, the detention of American citizens without trial or charges has raised serious concerns about the rule of law. The Supreme Court's recent decision to uphold this practice highlights the need for greater scrutiny of executive power.

The legacy of George W. Bush's policies also casts a long shadow. His use of ""free-fire zones"" in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted in civilian casualties and widespread destruction. The subsequent administration's attempts to justify these actions as necessary for national defense only serve to underscore the dangers of unchecked presidential power.

As the new administration takes office, it is essential that Congress reasserts its authority and ensures that executive branch actions are subject to meaningful oversight. The fate of civil liberties hangs in the balance, and it is up to lawmakers to prevent a repeat of the abuses seen under previous administrations.

As the summer months approach, gardeners are reaping the rewards of their hard work. Fresh produce is abundant, with cucumbers, eggplants, cherry tomatoes, and sweet peppers thriving in the warm weather. The addition of green beans and hot peppers to the mix will only add to the excitement.

But for those looking to supplement their diet with wild edibles, purslane is a great option. This succulent vegetable is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. It's a great alternative to traditional greens and can be found growing in many gardens.

For those interested in trying new things, peas are a great choice. These hardy legumes are easy to grow and can thrive in cool, moist conditions. They're perfect for adding to salads or enjoying as a snack.

In the kitchen, creative recipes like green tomato and pepper relish are making an appearance. This tangy condiment is made with chunks of tomatoes and peppers, pickled to perfection. It's a great way to add some excitement to summer meals.

Meanwhile, in the garden, mullein plants are sprouting up unexpectedly. These biennial flowers may be unwanted by some, but they're a welcome addition to any garden. They'll send up a flower stalk next year, adding beauty and interest to the landscape.

As the seasons change, it's essential to stay informed about food safety. A recent listeria outbreak has prompted a recall of certain frozen fruits and vegetables. Consumers are advised to check their products for affected items and discard them if necessary.

For those looking to take their gardening skills to the next level, self-sufficiency is key. By growing your own food and exploring wild edibles, you can enjoy a more sustainable and fulfilling lifestyle. With a little creativity and planning, anyone can become a successful gardener and enjoy the rewards of homegrown produce all year round.","""Summer Bounty: Local Farmers' Markets Abound with Fresh Produce""

As the summer months approach, local farmers' markets are filling up with an array of fresh produce. From heirloom tomatoes to artisanal cheeses, these markets offer a diverse selection of seasonal ingredients.

One farmer, Ray Bradley, has been cultivating his 27-acre farm in New Paltz, NY for years. His specialty is growing heirloom tomatoes, which he harvests by hand and sells at the local market. When asked about his secret to perfecting the tomato, Bradley simply says, ""A perfect tomato needs no embellishment.""

Meanwhile, on Avery Island, Louisiana, a different kind of bounty is being harvested. Edmund McIlhenny's Tabasco sauce has been a staple in Louisiana cuisine for over 150 years. The recipe involves crushing red peppers with a potato masher and mixing them with rock salt from the island's own mines.

For those looking to incorporate more vegetables into their diet, research suggests that creative naming can make all the difference. A study found that dishes named with descriptive words like ""twisted citrus-glazed carrots"" were 25% more popular than plain ""carrots.""

In New York City, a new restaurant is offering a unique take on traditional French cuisine. Meritage in Roslyn combines American ingredients with classic French dishes, resulting in a refined brasserie-bistro experience.

As the summer months approach, gardeners are preparing for the postseason by planting cool-season crops like lettuce and spinach. Forellenschluss and Lolla Rossa, two heirloom varieties, are popular choices for their mild flavors and versatility.

For those who have never been fans of vegetables, a recent convert shares her story. Aya Cash, actress and foodie, credits a salad made with fresh ingredients as the catalyst for her newfound love of vegetables.

With summer in full swing, local farmers' markets are offering an array of fresh produce to enjoy.

garden progress: june (before it's news) it’s really amazing how fast our garden grew in june. so far we have had two large cucumbers, an eggplant, handfuls of lemondrop cherry tomatoes, three roma amish paste tomatoes, and one green/yellow sweet pepper. we continue to watch everything grow daily. we have a few watermelons that are about the size of a pea and tons of brandywines that seem like any day will turn red. it’s so rewarding to eat a salad or meal that came mostly from our garden. last week we had greens with cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers and an eggplant melt with pesto made with basil from my herb garden. it was wonderful. pretty soon we should have green beans and hot peppers. we also planted more carrots and lettuce. read more at off the map source:

(before it's news) crunchy mama, a regular guest contributor here, shows you how to get your omega-3 fatty acids without eating fish oil capsules and having fish breath. good information to know and practice before and after a shtf event. disclaimer: this information is offered for educational purposes only. do your own due diligence before foraging wild edibles of any kind. originally published on her site the crunchy mama’s urban homestead. succulent, delicious garden weed: purslane by the crunchy mama welcome to another installment of crunchy mama’s wild food adventures! i am pleased to present one of my favorite summer wild edibles: purslane (portulaca oleracea)! i noticed purslane last year in my organic veggie garden. it was prolific (because we had put an irrigation system in). once i found out that it was edible, i tried it and i really enjoyed eating it. it is a mild-tasting, very slightly lemony, succulent vegetable that happens to be grown outside of the u.s., on purpose, to be eaten as one of the most nutritious vegetables around. in the u.s., most folks call it a weed. an acquaintance of mine mentioned that she developed an allergy to purslane. so, i am going to give a variation of the warning that just about every wild food blogger (teacher, etc.) gives to his/her audience: whenever you eat food that you have never eaten before, you should only have a little so that you

Article 3 - everything you possibly could want to know about growing peas
everything you possibly could want to know about growing peas (before it's news) image source: pixabay.com fresh peas are a thing of beauty. ready to eat in early summer, peas are some of the season’s first tastes of green. winters are long up north where i live, and eating fresh from the garden is a welcome treat. peas are delicious, fast-growing, and conducive to cold climates — the perfect plant for a northern garden. if you have not tried peas in your own backyard, i encourage you to do so. i have compiled some information about peas out of my favorite seed catalogs, as well as from andrea chesman’s cookbook serving up the harvest. read on for a few interesting facts about the wonderful pea plant and some great tips on how to grow them and enjoy a bountiful harvest. people have been enjoying fresh peas since as early as the 1600s. these hardy legumes were brought to north america by european settlers and were thomas jefferson’s favorite vegetable at his monticello garden. (his preference: the english pea.) peas like cool moist conditions and usually do poorly in hot dry weather. they grow best in northern climates, but with a little extra care can be grown as far south as virginia and possibly beyond. get the best deals on non-gmo pea seeds right here! these delectable vegetables can be enjoyed raw, steamed, stir-fried, in salads, and as out-of-hand snacks

Article 4 - chick pea, pumpkin & cilantro fritters
chick pea, pumpkin & cilantro fritters (before it's news) i know…i was even second guessing this one myself. but, they were incredible if i don’t say so myself (plus i had a few of my guinea pigs, uh i mean friends, try them out for me as well!). i had stopped at the store the other day to pick up some cilantro and all the store had was this huge bunch of it. now i love it, but don’t use it that often. this was also the day that i had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the check out counter to pay for said cilantro because apparently two cashiers didn’t know they had to come in to work the earlier shift…gotta love it! thank goodness for my smartphone, i don’t know what i did without one..hours and hours of entertainment at our fingertips. so after getting it home to use in another recipe i was making, i rinsed it off well, drained it on some paper towels, removed the stems, put it in a large resealable plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for later use. (hint: you can do this with most fresh herbs. it just doesn’t look pretty as a garnish once defrosted but it’s perfectly fine to use in your recipes.) anyhow, i was in my kitchen thinking about what i could also use this cilantro with when i noticed two things. 1.

Article 5 - green tomato and pepper relish
green tomato and pepper relish (before it's news) it’s that time of year – the last harvest of the season. we had a possible frost coming so we finally picked the last of the above ground vegetables from the garden. we had a lot, and i mean a lot (for us), of green tomatoes and peppers – a whole dishpan full and heaping. so i started pondering what we could make that would add to our stores that we would enjoy. this is what i came up with. i hope we do enjoy it. if not, it will be another good learning experience that turned out tasting yucky. the recipe we used calls for chunks of tomatoes and peppers in this pickled green tomato-pepper mix, but we would rather have a relish, so we grated them up. i started off by cutting the tomatoes in half and taking the seeds out of the peppers. then they had to wait a day or two in the refrigerator before i had time to get them canned. and this morning i had to get the rest of the sweet potatoes dug since we have a frost warning for tonight. more about the sweet potato harvest later. out comes the kitchenaid for the grating. it works great. the only thing we had to watch for was the occasional chunk of tomato or pepper skin. this recipe calls for: 7 lbs. green tomatoes (we had 13 1/2 lbs. so we adjusted the recipe accordingly) 12 cups peppers (

Article 6 - a close look…
a close look… (before it's news) with the days being so short now, and with having to work in london quite a lot, i haven’t seen much of the garden recently. it’s dark when i go out, and it’s dark when i come home. at the weekend though, i managed to take a good look. the blueberry bushes have mostly shed their leaves now, but there is one which still looks spectacular: i was surprised to see new flowers on the alpine strawberries. don’t they know it’s nearly the middle of november?! ﻿ the “black prince” chilli is still looking good too, covered with tiny red fruits. i don’t recommend this variety of chilli for culinary use, because its fruits are too fiddly to prepare, but it scores highly for its ornamental qualities. with its dark coloured foliage it could be attractive for flower-arrangers too! i was a bit annoyed to find that something had dug up one of my parsnips and had a nibble at it. evidently it didn’t like the taste, because the root had been gnawed but not eaten. hopefully this will convince whichever animal was responsible for this act of vandalism to leave the rest alone now. ﻿ i have been keeping a close eye on the “matsuri” broccoli and i see that the first of this current batch is nearing a useable size. ideally i would like to harvest two at a time, since this is a miniature variety

Article 7 - …. that sat down beside her, and…
…. that sat down beside her, and… % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) today was the day i decided to plant the greenhouse for our winter vegetables. i cleaned out the beds, added compost, watered it all well and planted 2 kinds of swiss chard, mache, italian dandelions, spicy greens mix and 2 kinds of kale. when i first started this kind of gardening, i tried all sorts of things, but now i know what i like and what we will really eat, and this short list is it! except… i saved about 50 onion sets in a little bag in the refrigerator from this spring: here is a view down inside the sack. they look rather sad, but most of them will grow: here are a few poked into the soil. they are so very easy to plant. just push them, root side down, into the moist soil and cover. it is all planted now. all i’ll have to do is keep it watered until everything comes up nicely, and then water once in a while and discourage a few weeds that will volunteer. look down in the far right corner. see that big green thing? that is a mullein plant that came up on its own this year. it is so pretty, i don’t have the heart to pull it up. mullein is a biennial, and next year will send up a flower stalk. it

Article 8 - alternative spinach greens
alternative spinach greens (before it's news) alternative spinach greens spinach is either loved or hated, there doesn’t seem to be much middle ground. this is probably the result of either being subjected to slimy canned spinach as a child, or having escaped those trials at the dining table. the good news is that love of spinach can be learned, especially when that spinach is freshly grown from your own garden, picked only minutes before showing up in a salad, sandwich or other dish. several visitors to our garden have proclaimed that they don’t like spinach, all the while munching on a few fresh leaves of the hated green.we have learned not to announce what we are handing out to be tasted, letting them try and taste before discussing it. more than one has been very pleasantly surprised to hear that they actually do like spinach, when it is fresh. what many don’t know is that spinach is a cool season crop, but for most of the country that means it can be grown twice a growing season, as an early spring green and then again as a fall and winter crop, planted at the end of the summer and enjoyed well into the colder seasons. some gardeners will enjoy their fresh spinach past thanksgiving and almost until christmas, even in the northern states with a cold frame, row cover or hoop house. the downside is that spinach becomes bitter rapidly when the temperatures are above about 80°f, but that is where the spinach alternatives arrive to rescue the summer salads. none of them are

Article 9 - listeria outbreak spurs crf to expand frozen food recall
listeria outbreak spurs crf to expand frozen food recall % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! crf frozen foods has expanded its recall of certain frozen fruits and vegetables to include everything produced in its pasco, wa, facility since may 2014 after learning seven people have become sick with listeria infections. two have died. more than 350 products sold under 42 brands are included in the recall. the products were sold in all 50 states and canada. several major retailers’ brands are part of the recall, including: costco, costco canada, walmart, safeway and trader joe’s. crf frozen foods posted the notice of the expanded recall at 11:45 p.m. monday in the form of a news release. the food and drug administration then picked up the recall notice, posting it on the agency website and issuing an alert to subscribers at about 10 a.m. today. “this expanded recall of frozen vegetables includes all of the frozen organic and traditional fruit and vegetable products manufactured or processed in crf frozen foods’ pasco facility since may 1, 2014,” according to the recall notice. “all affected products have the best by dates or sell by dates between april 26, 2016 and april 26, 2018.” the long shelf life of the recalled frozen produce is of particular concern because consumers could have purchased

Article 1 - fresh and ripe for the shopping
the stalls at local farmers' markets are filling out like cornfields in july. each week there are more choices, even more farmers. as you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. here it is. these purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. most bring crops to market month after month. but each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. for each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org, www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz. dabbling in flowers and honey till the tomatoes come in ray bradley used to be a sous-chef for david bouley, a childhood friend, so believe him when he says a perfect tomato needs no embellishment. he grows 10 heirlooms: 7 known successes like prudence purple, striped german and german green, and 3 wild cards each year. in addition to growing tomatoes at his 27-acre farm in new paltz, n.y.

Article 2 - who made that tabasco sauce?
photo in the years before the civil war, edmund mcilhenny was a new orleans banker and bon vivant whose pleasures included boats, horses and spicy food. but after the war, with much of the south in ruins, mcilhenny was unable to find work. after pounding the pavement in new orleans for months, he retreated to his wife’s family’s sugar plantation on petite anse (now called avery) island, a 2,200-acre salt dome rising from the marshes of southern louisiana. there, in the late 1860s, he tended his garden — particularly his bushes of spicy red peppers. accounts differ as to when exactly mcilhenny acquired the seeds for those capsicum frutescens peppers. but in the years after the war, he began using them to make pepper sauce, a popular louisiana condiment. his method was a laborious one that involved crushing the peppers with a potato masher and mixing them with rock salt from the island’s own salt mines, then aging the mash twice, adding vinegar in between. after straining the resulting mixture through a series of sieves, he decanted it into castoff cologne bottles. hot enough for ya? scoville heat units measure capsaicin, the chemical in hot peppers that gives them heat. chocolate habanero peppers 425,000-577,000 tabasco peppers 40,000-50,000 jalapeño 2

Article 3 - would carrots by any other name taste as sweet?
photo college students would rather eat “slow-roasted caramelized zucchini bites” than just plain “zucchini,” even when both dishes are prepared exactly the same way. researchers watched 27,933 customers over 46 days in a college cafeteria, of whom 8,279 selected vegetables. most of the diners were undergraduates, but about a third were graduate students and 15 percent were staff members. on different days, they could choose beets, corn, green beans, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, zucchini, carrots, or bok choy with mushrooms. the study is in jama internal medicine. each day, the experimenters varied the names of the dishes to create a different gustatory impression. the basic “carrots” served one day became the healthful but somewhat stern “carrots with sugar-free citrus dressing” the next, then mutated into the still health-conscious but more friendly “smart-choice vitamin c citrus carrots,” and finally achieved metamorphosis as the restaurant-menu worthy “twisted citrus-glazed carrots.” giving a vegetable dish a creative name — like “zesty ginger-turmeric sweet potatoes” instead of just plain “sweet potatoes” — resulted in 25 percent more people choosing the vegetable. but 35 percent more customers chose the zesty label than the health-positive “wholesome sweet potato superfood,” and 41 percent more chose it than the scolding “cholesterol-free sweet potatoes.” “this is a seemingly

Article 5 - american ingredients in french dishes
meritage in roslyn breaks the conventional brasserie mold. rather than trying to recreate a french haunt, shipped over piece by piece from paris, its owners, tom schaudel (of tease and coolfish) and blake verity (blake's bistro and before that panama hatties), have opted for a french-american amalgam. their very affordable new restaurant, at 1362 old northern boulevard (516-625-7771) where cafe laguna had been, is a refined brasserie-bistro that frequently uses american ingredients in comforting french dishes. idaho smoked trout, california frisée, malpeque oysters, yukon gold potatoes, hudson valley foie gras, long island skate wing and canadian veal are sometimes given nontraditional twists. escargot ($8) is illustrative. it's on the menu all right but arrives in a garlic and plum tomato strudel with a lemon mâche salad instead of the expected garlic butter. steak frites ($24), another brasserie old reliable, makes an appearance, but the meat is black angus boneless sirloin rather than hanger steak. meritage's transition has been accomplished with little muss or fuss. it looks much as cafe laguna did, with the addition of five oversize french food and wine posters and a few mirrors on its newly painted yellow and blue walls. the archway alcoves, candles, bare floors, recessed ceiling

Article 6 - preparing the garden for the postseason
i want him to come back in the fall and say the same thing about the lettuce i'm planting: forellenschluss, an heirloom romaine from austria whose name means ""speckled like a trout's back"" (seedsofchange.com; 888-762-7333), and lolla rossa, a frilled, magenta loose-leaf lettuce that matures in 55 days if you don't eat all the baby leaves much sooner (seed savers exchange: seedsavers.org; 563-382-5990). unprotected, these lettuces will not last all winter, but they will thrive, with cooler weather, through august and september. to determine if a particular lettuce, or any other crop, is a good candidate for fall planting, look at the number of days to maturation listed under the variety in the catalog, and count backward from your first hard frost date. for instance, many spinach varieties, which love cool weather, take only 40 days or so. springer spinach is getting a lot of attention lately because it doesn't bolt, or go to seed, or develop brown soft spots, in hot weather. ""it doesn't get funky; the leaves stay smooth and evenly green,"" said jo-anne van den berg-ohms, president of john scheepers kitchen garden seeds (kitchengardenseeds.com; 860-567-6086). ""it has a very mild, almost buttery

Article 7 - breakfast with oscar
all that has changed, of course. for one thing, no one is cool enough to carry off white tie these days. for another, there isn't a moment when some talk or entertainment show featuring movie pros doesn't bombard us (my current favorite is ''celebrity justice''). award shows glut the cables and air, and with the exception of woody, the jack and under secretary of state for middle eastern affairs sean penn, you can't keep movie stars off the tube with a stick. fifty years later, in a neat turn of events too symmetrical for poetry, television is now considered the important medium: if it weren't for television and her revenues, the academy, like pro football, probably wouldn't exist -- at least not in its current splendor. despite all the competition, the academy awards remains the king of award shows. it is watched by several hundred million people worldwide and is the most popular tv show that does not involve professional athletes. after years of personal snobbism, i now look forward to the four out of five nominated songs that have no melody, and i miss the jaw-dropping debbie allen choreography. i even admire the naked narcissism of most of the recipients, who, given what will probably be the only time in their lives they can say to a vast number of people whatever they want about art, honor, morality, politics and the hereafter, choose career preservation instead and thank lists of people nobody has ever heard of. for the

Article 8 - aya cash: the first time i ate a vegetable (i was 22)
in high school, i realized i needed more than just sugar to live, so every day i would buy and consume an entire bag of goldfish (that elusive pizza flavor really is the best). who needed multiple food groups? artificial flavors? count me in. butylated hydroxyanisole? yum! it wasn’t until i was 22 and newly graduated from college that i voluntarily chose to put a piece of lettuce in my mouth, then actually chewed and swallowed it. i was doing “the winter’s tale” and “a midsummer night’s dream” at the great river shakespeare festival, playing perdita and hermia — two characters whose names, in retrospect, sound like leafy greens. i was a working actor making $250 a week, more money than i had ever seen, and i felt like a real adult. but adults cooked and had wine with dinner. when i was invited for meals at other company members’ small apartments, i didn’t want to embarrass them by refusing their food, or embarrass myself by smuggling in a box of mike and ikes and a bag of cheez-its. one night, someone made a salad. just a salad. i stared at the plate — lettuce, onions, tomatoes — you know, salad. to me, that pile of fresh food was like a challenge out of “fear factor.” for years, i had been telling everyone that i didn’t eat vegetables. i believed i hated them. i even

Article 9 - quick bite/pickle-licious; in a pickle, and loving it
robyn brown-samra has made it her business to bring new york-style pickles to the brine hinterlands of new jersey. first she packed up her pickle store, pickle-licious, and moved from the upper west side to teaneck. then she continued to sell her wares at farmers markets around the state. and soon, for those who won't be enticed by pickles alone, she's decided to add what may make her pickle shop a pregnant woman's delight: a kosher ice cream bar. but ms. brown-samra, who learned pickling from guss's, the lower east side shop, plans for her country cottage store to remain primarily a pickle haven. you can smell the garlic and brine before you open the door. her pickles are held in large barrels, ready to be hand packed into pints ($3), quarts ($5), half gallons ($9.50) or gallons ($17). full sour pickles sit for seven to nine months before they're ready for sale; new pickles are ready the same day. she makes three-quarter sour, and half sour, kosher dill and sour tomatoes, and perfected the pickle on a stick. also available are a wide variety of hand packed olives and tapenades. her most popular item is the combo of citrus and hot olives, sold by the half pint ($3.50) or full pint ($7). samples are everywhere, ready to be eaten alone

Article 10 - 3 quick and savory recipes for peak-of-the-season tomatoes
photo we’re in tomato thrall. real tomatoes are back, in all their tomatoey glory. the cherry tomatoes at the greenmarket are so riotously colorful — bright little spheres in yellow, red, burgundy, orange and green — that i keep a big bowl of them on the kitchen table. it’s hard to pass by without grabbing a couple, as if i were reaching for a few juicy grapes or berries. photo we’re reclaiming the visceral summer experience of biting into a freshly picked, firm but truly ripe, never-refrigerated tomato and relishing it. at my house, there will be tomatoes in some fashion at every meal for the coming weeks. plain and unadulterated is the way to go with the first tomatoes of the season. thick slices or wedges, a little salt, a little pepper (optional), a drizzle of good olive oil, a plate. repeat. life is good. photo then take the next step, and dress your tomatoes with a garlicky vinaigrette. and when you’re ready to forge ahead with more forceful seasoning, remember the anchovy. tomatoes and anchovies play very well together, often in the company of olives and capers. chopped anchovies added to a dressing, or an anchovy fillet draped casually over a salad, provide a meaty, savory umami, not just saltiness. it’s a perfect match for sweet, ripe tomatoes. advertisement continue reading the main story go

Title: get green with the organicgirl flavor craze
Content: get green with the organicgirl flavor craze (before it's news) this is the time of year when our garden looks so sad. the tomato plants are shriveling and the peppers look like straggly weeds. the lettuces, kale and chard have been planted but it will be weeks (nay, months!) before they are ready to be eaten. finding fresh, organic produce sounds simple, but is no easy feat. we have been buying organicgirl arugula and romaine hearts at our local publix, so we were thrilled when they reached out to us and asked us to try their new salad mixes and dressings, we did not hesitate! our goodies arrived in a refrigerated box in which we were excited to find full-sized versions of their products. their new “peppergreens” has arugula (our favorite), baby mustards, cress, baby spinach, baby chard and other seasonal greens with a peppery kick. the “sweet pea” mix contains sweet pea shoots, baby green romaine, tango, baby oakleaf lettuces, baby green bok choy, lolla rosa (which may vary by season). all organicgirl greens are triple-washed and it is obvious. the greens were super clean, fresh and crisp and both had amazing flavor. the peppergreens really do pack a spicy punch that was an excellent complement to a pre-game blt. conversely, the sweat pea mix has a great crunch and is indeed a bit sweet with the addition of the pea shoots. organicgirl is a small group in california’s fertile salinas valley who strive to offer the very best quality produce done the right way which means unique approaches to organic growing, triple washing their greens, and using earth-friendly 100% recycled plastic packaging. it also means no synthetic pesticides, growing and selecting only the very best quality produce, and getting products to the stores as quickly as possible to ensure ultimate freshness. in addition to the gorgeous greens, we also received bottles of each of organicgirl’s new salad love vinaigrettes: fresh tomato italian, kale parmesan, lemon agave, and white cheddar. believe me when i say it was nearly impossible to decide which to try first! we went with the lemon agave (vegan) made with fresh lemons and lemon puree which originally we tried on the peppergreens and wow what a great combo! the contrast in flavors was absolutely perfect, spicy, tangy and a little sweet. we later served it over goat cheese for a healthy snack which was zesty and refreshing. the vibrant green of the kale parmesan was so enticing, we opened that next. we had some leftover roasted cauliflower which rather than reheating, we tried cold with the vinaigrette drizzled on top. again, wow! with two of the top ingredients (kale and spinach) being #1 and #5 on

""Summer Bounty: Local Farmers' Markets Abound with Fresh Produce""

As the summer months approach, local farmers' markets are filling up with an array of fresh produce. From heirloom tomatoes to artisanal cheeses, these markets offer a diverse selection of seasonal ingredients.

One farmer, Ray Bradley, has been cultivating his 27-acre farm in New Paltz, NY for years. His specialty is growing heirloom tomatoes, which he harvests by hand and sells at the local market. When asked about his secret to perfecting the tomato, Bradley simply says, ""A perfect tomato needs no embellishment.""

Meanwhile, on Avery Island, Louisiana, a different kind of bounty is being harvested. Edmund McIlhenny's Tabasco sauce has been a staple in Louisiana cuisine for over 150 years. The recipe involves crushing red peppers with a potato masher and mixing them with rock salt from the island's own mines.

For those looking to incorporate more vegetables into their diet, research suggests that creative naming can make all the difference. A study found that dishes named with descriptive words like ""twisted citrus-glazed carrots"" were 25% more popular than plain ""carrots.""

In New York City, a new restaurant is offering a unique take on traditional French cuisine. Meritage in Roslyn combines American ingredients with classic French dishes, resulting in a refined brasserie-bistro experience.

As the summer months approach, gardeners are preparing for the postseason by planting cool-season crops like lettuce and spinach

One key factor is the sense of community that develops among students. In a smaller setting, everyone knows each other, and friendships are forged quickly. This leads to a more relaxed atmosphere, where students feel comfortable being themselves and having fun.

Another benefit of small colleges is their focus on teaching and learning. With fewer distractions, students can truly engage with the material and develop meaningful relationships with their professors. This, in turn, fosters a sense of belonging and connection among students.

For those interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), small colleges often offer top-notch programs. At institutions like North Carolina State University, students can explore fields like chemistry and biochemistry, preparing them for successful careers.

In the business world, graduates from institutions like Hofstra University are well-equipped to succeed. With a strong focus on international business and a diverse student body, Hofstra provides students with valuable experience and connections.

For those looking to make a difference, small colleges can be a powerful force. At Fairfield University, students are encouraged to get involved in activism and community service, developing their skills and passion for social justice.

Ultimately, the key to success lies not in size, but in the sense of community and connection that develops among students. By focusing on teaching, learning, and personal growth, small colleges can create a vibrant and exciting social scene that sets them apart from larger institutions.","""Rethinking Higher Education: Balancing Academic Excellence with Social Responsibility""

As the higher education landscape continues to evolve, institutions are facing increasing pressure to balance academic excellence with social responsibility. A growing number of colleges and universities are recognizing the importance of preparing students for the complexities of the real world.

One approach is to incorporate service-learning projects into curricula, as seen at Pace University in New York. By requiring faculty to integrate community-based learning into their courses, institutions can foster a sense of civic engagement among students.

However, this approach also raises questions about the role of elite universities and the impact of for-profit institutions on higher education. While Ivy League schools may need to ensure that top applicants enroll, they must also consider the long-term consequences of prioritizing prestige over accessibility.

Meanwhile, regional career academies like the Effingham Regional Career Academy in Illinois are working to provide vocational training to both high school students and adults. Despite funding challenges, these programs demonstrate a commitment to equipping students with practical skills for the workforce.

The rise of online education has also transformed the higher education landscape. With over 1.6 million students taking online courses in 2002, institutions must adapt to meet the changing needs of their students.

However, this shift towards online learning raises concerns about accessibility and equity. Institutions must ensure that all students have access to quality educational resources, regardless of their background or location.

Ultimately, higher education institutions must rethink their approach to admissions, prioritizing factors such as caring for others over individual achievement. By doing so, they can create a more inclusive and equitable system that prepares students for success in the 21st century.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

Article 1 - 7 reasons why it’s better to party at a small college
if you picked your college based on where the best parties go down, well…you probably didn’t go to amherst college. or swarthmore. or really any institution of higher learning whose name does not start with “university of…” little colleges don’t get a bad rep when it comes to nightlife–they just don’t get a rep at all. “i’m schmacked” doesn’t stop at liberal arts campuses to see what’s going on. that’s a shame because small schools may not have enough partygoers to fill a stadium, or even a stadium parking lot, but as the wisdom goes, “it’s not about the size of the boat…it’s about the motion of the ocean.” here are seven scientifically proven reasons that small schools do it better. view gallery

Article 2 - professional development reflection 2: encouraging teacher leaders
professional development reflection 2: encouraging teacher leaders (before it's news) one of the best unwritten parts of my job, aside from sharing classroom tech strategies, is empowering teachers to be leaders. today, a teacher told me that she wanted my job. she had a passion for technology and dreamed of being in the position to help other teachers. i don’t think that i have ever been as excited as i was at that moment. i immediately asked her if she was sharing her work online, if she was on twitter and if she had ever taught sessions on her campus. when she responded that she did not think that she “could” teach sessions on campus, i knew right away what the next step needed to be. i needed to support her on her journey of sharing by helping her to share with the teachers at home. when the goal of a campus is transformative teaching through the use of technology, teacher buy-in is a mandatory component of the process. any time that campuses have teachers who are willing to take the leap to share, we must encourage them to do so as empowered teachers develop empowered students. immediately following today’s series of meetings, plans were put in place so that this teacher and any other teacher in the building with a desire to share… could. it was even more amazing hearing her campus leader express her excitement at supporting this process. there was a point in my career when i too yearned to share outside of my room. someone afforded me the opportunity. now, i

when diversity drops: julie j. park interview (before it's news) ****************** phillip luke sinitiere (pls): in brief, can you give use a brief synopsis of the main argument(s) of when diversity drops? julie j. park (jjp): the main argument is that drops in racial diversity in the university have a severely negative effect on students’ ability to sustain multiracial communities on campus. i examined how this dynamic played out in the intervarsity christian fellowship at “california university,” a multiracial campus fellowship that struggled over the years to sustain its diversity given the drop in black enrollment at cu. while religion can mediate notable shifts in organizational culture related to racial diversity, its ability to do so is limited by broader structural conditions and inequality in both the university setting and society at large. pls: turning to methodology, what got you interested in this topic, and how does your approach to studying intervarsity christian fellowship (ivcf) compare to studies of other evangelical christian ministries (e.g., john g. turner’s book on campus crusade for christ)? jjp: i witnessed a “race matters” forum, a facilitated dialogue on race, when visiting stanford’s ivcf chapter years ago. this propelled me to start doing ethnographic observations of the ivcf at “cu“ some time later as a graduate student, which turned into this project. a few other studies of campus fellowships (books by paul br

Article 1 - a place for politics on campus?
to the editor: stanley fish's call for colleges and universities to ''aim low'' and stop encouraging citizenship overlooks the teaching value of applying knowledge to real situations and reflecting on them with the disciplines of classroom, lab and library. today's students care about the social issues of their world, else why would we be seeing large campus majorities doing volunteer work? far fewer students, however, vote. getting a taste of social concerns by undertaking modest service projects as part of classes that put such projects in larger contexts, as my university's faculty now requires, is one tool for closing that gap. campuses with this approach are modeling the habits, skills and excitement of taking part in the democratic process, whatever side one may end up on. david a. caputo president, pace university new york, may 21, 2004

Article 4 - feeling strains, baptist colleges cut church ties
“the future of baptist higher education has rarely been more fragile,’’ r. kirby godsey, the former president of mercer university in macon, ga., said in a speech in atlanta in june. the georgia baptist convention voted last november to sever ties with mercer. the issues vary from state to state. but many southern baptist colleges and their state conventions have been battling over money, control of boards of trustees, whether the bible must be interpreted literally, how evolution is taught, the propriety of some books for college courses and of some plays for campus performances and whether cultural and religious diversity should be encouraged. at the root of the conflicts is the question of how much the colleges should reflect the views of their denomination. they are part of the continuing battle among southern baptists for control of their church’s institutions. more than 20 years ago, theological and cultural conservatives gained control over moderates in the southern baptist convention, the denomination’s broadest body, representing more than 16 million worshipers. similar shifts then occurred in many, but not all, state baptist conventions, which have considerable independence. the struggle has continued. last month, the southern baptist convention elected a president who promised to be “a big-tent conservative” and defeated candidates supported by the convention’s establishment. southern baptist colleges are affiliated with the state conventions, and it does not make sense to many members of the conventions to provide significant annual subsidies to baptist colleges

Article 5 - a different course
today, 1 in 12 college students attends a for-profit institution, and the business has grown to $23 billion in annual revenue for 2002, the latest year analyzed by eduventures, an education market research company in boston. the university of phoenix alone has about 201,000 full-time adult students at 142 campuses and learning centers. enrollment in for-profit institutions is growing at three times the rate of nonprofit colleges and universities, says sean gallagher, an analyst with eduventures. a big part of that growth is in online education. ''each time we update our forecasts, we find that the online education market is growing a little bit larger than we anticipated,'' mr. gallagher says. according to a study last year by the sloan consortium, a nonprofit association whose mission is to improve online education, more than 1.6 million students took online courses in 2002; nearly 600,000 of them took all their classes in cyberspace. more than a third of higher education institutions offer online courses, and 97 percent of public universities do. the education market didn't always look so rosy. not that long ago, traditional colleges came to envision nontraditional education as a potential cash cow. prominent universities like new york university and temple rushed in with the creation of for-profit subsidiaries that promised to blend ivory-tower class and dot-com nimbleness. but by 2001, most of those highly touted experiments had failed. columbia

Article 6 - bringing potential dropouts back from the brink
roosevelt has a 34.6 percent dropout rate, according to figures from the new york state department of education from the 2004-5 academic year (the latest year for which statistics are available). by comparison, nearby hempstead has a 7.1 percent dropout rate and malverne a 3.7 percent dropout rate. to improve their dropout numbers, officials in districts throughout long island said they were taking aggressive steps to keep students in the classroom. next year, malverne will start a mentoring program to help students most at risk of dropping out. “once they slip away, it’s hard to reconstruct a successful path,” said james h. hunderfund, the superintendent. brentwood also has programs in place to stem dropouts, including one that identifies children as young as elementary age who are not attending school and may be at risk of dropping out in later years. sheile’s prospects improved when she enrolled in the new horizons alternative education program at roosevelt high school. the five-year-old program caters to about 85 students from the regular high school who have been identified as academically at risk, whether because of truancy, disciplinary issues or even incarceration, said charlene stroughn, the program director. housed in the sprawling roosevelt high school, new horizons classes take place in late afternoon and early evening, long after the 700 or so students enrolled in the regular high school have gone home. the

Article 7 - administrative glut
for a look at these positions, we examined employment openings advertised in the chronicle of higher education. in the past, typical postings would be from colleges seeking, say, a new provost or a registrar. here are just a few posts of recent vintage: vice president for student success, residential communications coordinator, credential specialist, dietetic internship director, director of active and collaborative engagement, and coordinator of learning immersion experiences. each of these offices certainly has a plausible rationale. the williams spouse/partner employment counselor helps faculty members. and since it isn’t easy being gay or lesbian while away at college, a queer life coordinator can help such students focus on their studies. but being a useful service does not mean it’s necessary. or that the service needs an administrator and a staff. or, for that matter, that it enhances the college’s educational mission, even indirectly. and administrators don’t simply absorb salaries. they also need physical space. facilities are often underwritten by bond issues, which oblige colleges to make annual interest payments, not to mention ultimately repaying the principal. kenyon college’s $70 million taj mahal of an athletics center houses more than 40 coaches. its sushi bar requires chefs, and the coffee station needs baristas. meanwhile, kenyon’s philosophy department has to get along with five faculty members. given this imbalance, we couldn’t help but wonder, is this a college or a resort? we certainly know which part is growing fastest. the amenities arms

though duke is in durham, n.c., whose namesake family made its billions in tobacco, most of duke's students hail from elsewhere. the university's popularity as an alternative to the ivy league has been refined in recent years. students fondly call the campus gothic wonderland. this disney reference acknowledges the incongruity of its gray-stone oxbridge architecture, constructed in the 1930's as a wishful invocation of europe: real culture, faux antiquity. it could not, like chapel hill's 18th-century campus, be built of native red brick. why? the tobacco warehouses visible from the duke campus are all brick. as a native north carolinian, one too familiar with the state's code of privilege and fraternity, i left home early. i went north to school, taking my chances among strangers rather than trusting the old-boy network that might've worked for me. but after decades elsewhere, i came back, bought an arts and crafts house, settled here to grow a garden, love my friends. i daily observe and adore this place. i know firsthand the good will of the durham community. through duke's center for documentary studies, i have taught fourth graders writing and drawing. my class included professors' children as well as children of the cleaning crews who nightly scrub their labs and offices. it is criminal that this sexual and racial accusation might seem typical. it's sad that the university administration's three-week silence appeared to sanction such

Article 9 - using student selfies for writing assessment and classroom connections
while some students did not have access at the time (wireless and equipment challenges), and some wanted more time to prepare for their “close-up,” this prereading activity was captivating and enjoyable for students. students’ background knowledge on the subject was acknowledged, and the article and questions posed provided the opportunity for rich discussion, entering the conversation, and connection to the writing task. questions posed and then incorporated in a quickwrite were based on those in the learning network post, “why do we take selfies?” they included: • how often do you take selfies — pictures of yourself — with your cellphone camera and send them to someone, or post them on social media? • what kind do you take, and what reactions do you usually get? • why do you think there has been such an increase in this kind of picture-taking in recent years? we then read the entire article over a period of a few days, while i printed and created a bulletin board of their selfies as they were sent to me. this display was maintained all year, and provided a forum of self-expression and classroom collaboration. students discussed key concepts of the “selfie phenomenon” and responded to the following questions for their writing task: • why do we take selfies? how does the selfie differ from a photograph taken by another, and what does this tell us about ourselves and our society? • is taking selfies about vanity, about trying to understand how others see you, or about something else? why do you think people take and

Additionally, the article mentions Bill Maher and HBO as partners and investors, which further supports the reliability of the information. The tone and style of the article also suggest that it is a serious news piece, rather than sensational or speculative. While there are some similarities in topic between the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE and the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE, the overall content and approach of the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE make it the more accurate classification.","Speculation Surrounds Mysterious Phenomenon

A widespread phenomenon has been observed, with many individuals speculating about its origins and implications. The topic has garnered significant attention online, with various theories and interpretations emerging.

The speculation is often linked to a particular individual or group, who is said to be providing cryptic clues and hints through videos and other media. This figure is referred to as ""Q,"" and their statements have been subject to intense analysis and interpretation by the public.

Over the past several years, numerous theories have emerged about Q's identity, motivations, and goals. Some believe that Q is a government insider or a whistleblower, while others think it may be a hoax or a prank.

Despite the lack of concrete evidence, the speculation has led to a significant online community, with many individuals sharing their own theories and interpretations. The phenomenon has also sparked debates about free speech, censorship, and the role of social media in shaping public discourse.

While some have dismissed Q as a mere conspiracy theory, others believe that there may be more to it than meets the eye. As the speculation continues, one thing is clear: the mysterious phenomenon has tapped into a deep-seated desire for truth and transparency in a world where many feel disillusioned with traditional institutions.","In a world where misinformation and partisan screeds dominate social media, a small startup is quietly making waves with its mission to break down complex issues into easily digestible content. attn:, founded by Matthew Segal and Jarrett Moreno in 2014, has achieved impressive growth on Facebook, with videos averaging over 3.8 million views in the first 30 days.

This success is not limited to entertainment; big partners and investors, including Bill Maher and HBO, have taken notice of attn:'s unique approach. The startup's focus on short, viral videos – particularly animated ones – has resonated with audiences worldwide.

Meanwhile, traditional journalism is facing an uncertain future. A ""dying breed"" of local columnists, once feared by politicians and mobsters alike, are struggling to adapt to the changing media landscape. While some have found new life in online publications, others are being forced out due to declining readership.

In the world of film, a new generation of independent filmmakers is emerging. Mr. Pierson's passion for his brand of cinema is palpable, and his segments produced by other film folk showcase an infectious enthusiasm. From user-centered design to artificial intelligence, the topics are diverse and far-reaching.

On the other end of the spectrum, global fashion shows have become a spectacle, with models parading across screens in real-time. However, behind the glamour lies a complex web of production and distribution, with some critics labeling it ""sleazy.""

In the world of journalism, change is underway. Glenn Greenwald, the lawyer and writer who exposed government surveillance, has announced his departure from The Guardian to join a new venture. This move marks a shift towards building a media organization from scratch, driven by a commitment to adversarial, accountability journalism.

As technology continues to evolve, concerns about security are growing. A recent discovery of massive vulnerabilities in cloud computing has raised questions about the safety of hosting data online. While these flaws are unlikely to be catastrophic, they highlight the need for greater awareness and caution in our increasingly digital world.

Article 1 - here's how startup attn: averages a whopping 3.8 million views per video on facebook
(attn: founders matthew segal (left) and jarrett moreno (right)attn:/lance williams) during the election, when social media seemed filled to the brim with fake news and partisan screeds meant to confuse, a startup called attn: was quietly continuing its mission to make complex social issues easy to understand. attn:’s most effective tool: short viral videos, particularly animated ones spread on facebook. even if you’ve never heard attn:’s name, you’ve probably seen one of its videos, which average a whopping 3.8 million views in the first 30 days — more than any other facebook publisher, according to tubular labs. attn: says it has never paid for that reach, and that all its growth on social media is natural. that is an impressive feat for a startup that is not yet a household name, and perhaps it's why attn: has already attracted big partners and investors, especially in entertainment — from bill maher and hbo, to apple music and jimmy iovine, to ryan seacrest. attn: has raised $24 million total, including a $20 million series b round in 2016. digestible issues matthew segal and jarrett moreno, who had previously run the voter empowerment organization ourtime.org, founded attn: in 2014, with the goal of breaking down issues in a way that’s easy to digest.

in the coming days you’ll hear about the way he could find the story everybody else was missing and — if people stay true to his own tradition — about his nastier side, too, which showed itself in the ethnic and sexist tirade he unleashed at a korean-american colleague that led to his suspension from newsday in 1990. but you’ll also hear, if you haven’t already, that as a once-mighty local columnist feared by politicians and mobsters alike, he was “the last of a dying breed.” the phrase is about more than nostalgia (for instance, no one is pining for the gender imbalance of mr. breslin’s heyday). it’s about where news is going and, more to the point, where it’s going away, which will have an effect on you and where you live in ways that can be hard to appreciate until it’s too late. we can all thank our higher powers that a lot of those great bylines are still around — jim dwyer and gail collins (now at the new york times) and steve lopez (the los angeles times) and michael daly (the daily beast), to name a few. and there are next-generation versions who are bringing to life important stories, like gilbert garcia of the san antonio express-news and ginia bellafante of the times. but “it used to be that there were many more of them,” the writer jonathan

(janet pierson is now the chief programmer of the film section of south by southwest, the annual festival in austin, tex.) “most of the ideas were things i myself was wildly enthusiastic about,” he continued. “but there was a pool of larger people coming to me with their ideas, and the point of the whole show was to spread that enthusiasm around — i’ve sometimes described myself as the johnny appleseed of this world. so when people who were capable came to me with ideas they loved, but i might not have had the same personal attachment to, i was beholden to give them opportunities to create segments around stuff they loved.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters.

a young woman with magenta-streaked hair stands in her bathroom, speaking to a webcam. in a hushed tone, she chews over a thorny problem of young adulthood: how to apply full evening makeup when you’re already inebriated from drinking all day? she begins her tutorial by wielding that totem of collegiate binge drinking everywhere: a red plastic solo cup. one jump cut later (after a “law and order: s.v.u.” drinking game), she re-emerges, thoroughly intoxicated. she misapplies a gob of glue. it dangles from a false eyelash. she lines her lips with a black pencil. “it doesn’t matter what color it is, ’cause you’re gonna blend it,” she slurs, batting her eye glue. “don’t let this scare you.” the video, titled “drunk makeup tutorial,” is completely awesome to some, bewildering to others — and above all, classic jenna marbles, another installment from a reigning queen of youtube. the episode has been viewed 14.6 million times. while few people older than 30 probably know who jenna marbles is, her popularity is unquestioned among teenage girls who live on the internet. she has more facebook fans than jennifer lawrence, more twitter followers than fox news and more instagram friends than oprah. her weekly videos on topics as quotidian as “what girls do in the bathroom in the morning,” “my favorite dance moves

Article 8 - reporter tied to snowden leaks to leave guardian
glenn greenwald, the lawyer and writer who provided the biggest journalistic disclosure of the year when he published revelations from edward j. snowden about government surveillance, said on tuesday that he would be leaving the guardian, the british daily, for a new journalistic venture. in a statement on his web site, mr. greenwald did not say where he was going. “i was presented with a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity that no journalist could possibly decline,” mr. greenwald wrote on his blog tuesday evening. mr. greenwald said he declined to provide details about his next job because the news had leaked to the media outlet buzzfeed “before we were prepared to announce it,” adding that the venture would “be unveiled very shortly.” in a phone interview late tuesday, he said that “one of the best parts of this is participating in building a media organization from scratch. i can shape its mission, how it functions, what its objectives are and most importantly, help to choose the people i am working with.” advertisement continue reading the main story he said the site would not be driven by a particular political ideology, but added that “setting out to pursue adversarial, accountability journalism is a kind of ideology.”

Article 10 - an advocate for tv that viewers create
viewer-created content is at the heart of current’s business model. in phoenix, mr. gore called current a way of “relating the internet to television” — and in that respect it is like no other network on television. there are no hourlong dramas or documentaries; in fact, there is no programming schedule to speak of. every segment is called a pod, and the pods are broadcast in a seemingly random order, so a spot about california surfers could follow a report about gunslingers in mogadishu, somalia. some pods are barely a minute long; others last 12 minutes. in that way, current is something like having a cable channel dedicated to high-quality youtube videos. and while some web surfers may enjoy that, there is little evidence that television viewers do. two weeks ago, the cw network canceled a viral video clip show called “online nation”; abc ran six episodes of “i-caught,” a newsmagazine based on amateur video, over the summer, but it did not catch on. mr. hyatt said he thought those efforts were fundamentally flawed — “it’s not in their dna,” he said — and contrasted them with current’s philosophical embrace of viewer-created content. “we’ve built a business, and now we’ve got to create a phenomenon around it,” mr. hyatt said. staff members portray mr. gore as the channel’s visionary force and say he works from current’s offices a few days a month. if

FAKE NEWS ARTICLE
-----------------
Speculation Surrounds Mysterious Phenomenon

A widespread phenomenon has been observed, with many individuals speculating about its origins and implications. The topic has garnered significant attention online, with various theories and interpretations emerging.

The speculation is often linked to a particular individual or group, who is said to be providing cryptic clues and hints through videos and other media. This figure is referred to as ""Q,"" and their statements have been subject to intense analysis and interpretation by the public.

Over the past several years, numerous theories have emerged about Q's identity, motivations, and goals. Some believe that Q is a government insider or a whistleblower, while others think it may be a hoax or a prank.

Despite the lack of concrete evidence, the speculation has led to a significant online community, with many individuals sharing their own theories and interpretations. The phenomenon has also sparked debates about free speech, censorship, and the role of social media in shaping public discourse.

While some have dismissed Q as a mere conspiracy theory, others believe that there may be more to it than meets the eye. As the speculation continues, one thing is clear: the mysterious phenomenon has tapped into a deep-seated desire for truth and transparency in a world where many feel disillusioned with traditional institutions.

456892.0,fake,reliable,0.8,135.36965680122375,False," The article ""A Shift in Global Politics: A New Era of Tensions"" is the most similar to a reliable news article because it presents factual information about global politics, including the US's internal issues and diplomatic efforts with Russia and other nations. The article also provides specific dates and names, such as President Barack Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel, which suggests that it is based on actual events.  In contrast, the FAKE NEWS ARTICLE ""A Web of Deceit: Uncovering the Hidden Agendas Behind Global Events"" contains several red flags, including unsubstantiated claims about US President George H.W. Bush's promise to Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev and the involvement of North Korea in various attacks. Additionally, the article makes sensational claims about a luxury hotel and casino being opened in Pyongyang by the Trump Organization.  While both articles contain some factual information, the RELIABLE NEWS ARTICLE is more grounded in reality and presents a more balanced view of global politics. The FAKE NEWS ARTICLE, on the other hand, appears to be an attempt to create a narrative that is not supported by evidence.","A Web of Deceit: Uncovering the Hidden Agendas Behind Global Events

In recent years, a series of events has unfolded with alarming frequency, leaving many to wonder about the true intentions behind these global occurrences. From the collapse of the Soviet Union to the rise of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, it appears that powerful forces are at play.

A pivotal moment in modern history was marked by a promise made by US President George H.W. Bush to Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev, which would shape the course of international relations for decades to come. However, this promise has been repeatedly denied, leaving many to question its validity.

Meanwhile, the world witnessed a series of devastating attacks, including the Las Vegas shooting and the Sony hack, which were attributed to North Korea's involvement. However, recent revelations suggest that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had access to North Korea's networks before these events, casting doubt on the official narrative.

In another shocking development, it has emerged that the Trump Organization is set to open a luxury hotel and casino in Pyongyang, with the US purchasing the Ryugyong Hotel for $850 million. This deal has sparked concerns about the true intentions behind this agreement, which may be more than just a simple business transaction.

Furthermore, experts have warned of an impending ""purge"" on Inauguration Day, citing signs that suggest something is amiss. With tensions between the US and Russia escalating, it appears that the world is on the brink of a new Cold War.

As we navigate this complex web of deceit, it becomes increasingly clear that nothing is as it seems. The truth behind these events remains shrouded in mystery, leaving us to wonder what lies ahead for our world.","A Shift in Global Politics: A New Era of Tensions

The world is witnessing a significant shift in global politics, with several key players vying for influence and power. The United States, once the sole superpower, is facing challenges from emerging nations like Russia and China.

In recent years, the US has been grappling with its own internal issues, including the decline of its nuclear industry. The country's enrichment corporation, which was once a major player in the global market, has closed one of its plants due to rising costs and competition from more efficient facilities in Europe.

Meanwhile, Russia is experiencing a period of nostalgia for its past glory, particularly under the leadership of Fidel Castro, who was seen as a thorn in America's side during the Cold War era. However, this nostalgia is not enough to mask the country's growing economic instability and corruption scandals.

The US has also been engaging in a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve long-standing conflicts, including the Ukraine crisis. President Barack Obama has urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a settlement before his term ends, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande have launched their own initiatives to revive a stalled peace process.

In other news, Trump Tower, once a symbol of luxury and exclusivity, has been embroiled in controversy over its past occupants. The building's developer, Donald Trump, has faced criticism for his business practices and personal life.

As the world navigates this complex landscape, it is clear that the old rules no longer apply. A new era of tensions and rivalries is emerging, with far-reaching implications for global politics and economies.",10,10,"RetrievalConfig(k=10, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are an expert journalist and fact-checker.

how america double-crossed russia and shamed the west headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! eric zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org the conditionality of the soviet union’s agreement to allow east germany to be taken by west germany and for the cold war to end, was that nato would not expand “one inch to the east.” this was the agreement that was approved by the russian president of the soviet union, mikhail gorbachev, a great man and a subsequent hero to democrats around the world. he agreed then to end the soviet union and abandon communism and thus to end the entire cold war; he agreed to this because he had been promised that nato would expand not “one inch to the east,” or “one inch eastward,” depending upon how the promise was translated and understood — but it has the same meaning, no matter how it was translated. he trusted american president george herbert walker bush, whose friend and secretary of state james baker made this promise to gorbachev. with this promise, gorbachev agreed to end the soviet union; end the communist mutual-defense pact which was their own equivalent of nato, the warsaw pact; and he believed that the remaining nation that he would then be leading, which was russia, would be accepted as being a western democracy. he was even promised by the united states that “we

nsa had access to north korea networks before sony attack % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the u.s. national security agency has long had access to north korea’s networks — and it is that access that enabled u.s. authorities to so quickly determine the country’s involvement in the november hack of sony pictures. the nsa tapped into north korea’s computer network in 2010, planting malware with the ability to track the internal workings of many networks used by the country’s hackers, the new york times is reporting. it is that malware that not only enabled the fbi to quickly point the finger at the north korean government but gave president barack obama the confidence to level accusations against the government of kim jong-un. the times report, which cited former u.s. and foreign officials, computer experts and a newly disclosed nsa document, indicated the government did not wish to disclose its method of gathering intelligence in this case for fear of losing its in to north korea’s networks. according to the report, the proof of north korea’s involvement in the cyber-attack on sony pictures and threats of violence against theaters showing the interview was so absolute, obama “had no doubt” which, in turn, led to the imposition of new sanctions against the country. james a. lewis, a cyber-warfare expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington said that, normally

pyongyang, dprk. – u.s. officials met in secret with a delegation from north korea last month to iron out the details of a historic agreement that will allow the trump organization to open a luxury hotel and casino in pyongyang as an incentive for the regime to dismantle its nuclear program, a senior state department official told the wall street journal on friday. “north koreans may soon find themselves enjoying all the benefits and experiences that a five-star luxury resort has to offer,” state department spokesperson stacy friedman told the journal. under the agreement, the united states will purchase the ryugyong hotel, a 105-story pyramid-shaped skyscraper located in pyongyang, for $$850 million before turning ownership of the property over to the trump organization. “ultimately, north korea will pay us back for the cost of the hotel,” explained ms. friedman before adding that the five-star resort will provide a significant boost to north korea’s struggling economy. while the united states does not maintain official contact with the country’s reclusive leadership, officials have expressed confidence that north korea’s supreme leader kim jong-un will be “extremely satisfied” with pyongyang’s trump international hotel and casino. “one of the more visually stunning aspects of this property is its sheer size, especially when compared to the trump world towers in seoul,” a senior white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told the washington times

(before it's news) tony cartalucci – neo ) – it was recently announced that us president donald trump selected us army lieutenant general herbert raymond mcmaster as his national security adviser. the new york times in their article, “trump chooses h.r. mcmaster as national security adviser,” would report: president trump appointed lt. gen. h. r. mcmaster as his new national security adviser on monday, picking a widely respected military strategist known for challenging conventional thinking and helping to turn around the iraq war in its darkest days. in reality, what president trump has done, is select a man who will bring very little of his own thoughts with him to the position. instead, he will – verbatim – repeat the talking points, reflect the agenda of, and serve the interests driving the collection of corporate-financier funded think tanks that devise – and have devised for decades – us-european foreign policy. what general mcmaster represents in a talk given at one such think tank, the center for strategic and international studies – funded by corporations such as exxonmobil, hess, chevron, and boeing and chaired by individuals including president trump’s secretary of state, rex tillerson and representatives from lockheed martin, raytheon, and betchel – general mcmaster provides a well-rehearsed pitch collectively reflecting the worldview hashed out by not only the csis itself, but admittedly the worldview and objectives of the brook

Article 8 - terrifying graphic of radioactive isotopes spreading from likely north korea nuke detonation over pacific ocean +videos
terrifying graphic of radioactive isotopes spreading from likely north korea nuke detonation over pacific ocean +videos (before it's news) by hal turner / my daily informer the head of the comprehensive (nuclear) test ban treaty organization (ctbto) has published a graphic showing a “rough simulation” of the spread of radioactive fallout from a north korea test nuclear detonation over the pacific ocean. the graphic shows british columbia, canada, california, oregon and washington state being dosed first (and fast) but all of us in earth’s northern hemisphere being “dosed” within two weeks. lassina zerbo of ctbto called it a “rough simulation” of a “radio-isotope cloud” from a “hypothetical atmospheric burst” over the pacific. folks better prepare right now because radioactive iodine from such a test can quickly accumulate in the human thyroid, potentially leading to thyroid cancer later. thyroid cancer is 90% curable in women, but 95% fatal in men. taking potassium iodate pills for seven days after a nuke test can protect humans from radioactive iodine and thus, the cancer it causes. here’s how to get them . . . the simulation below was posted on twitter by lassina zerbo, the head of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization, which is tasked with monitoring weapons tests. the simulation shows how radiation is likely to spread once north korea detonates a

(tass/afp/getty images) moscow — even after the soviet union was long dead and gone, many russians still saw him as their man in havana. in a bygone time, fidel castro was moscow’s communist ally in the united states' back yard, a persistent reminder that the soviet union had friends in the west, just 90 miles off the coast of florida. he was greeted by adoring crowds in a 40-day-long trip to the soviet union in 1963, and remained among the daring, young faces of socialism as moscow's leaders grew steadily older and their funerals more frequent. but moscow’s fascination with castro extended beyond the soviet union's collapse in 1991. nostalgia played a part of that. but more importantly, in nominally capitalist

Article 3 - creating russia/china bogeymen
relying on the most unreliable propaganda, washington’s foreign policy establishment is seeking massive new military spending to counter russian and chinese “aggression” — when a more sober analysis would show these “threats” to be wildly exaggerated, as gilbert doctorow explains. by gilbert doctorow where russia is concerned – and now also china – one can count on foreign affairs magazine to feature articles presenting the bogeymen in a form that the u.s. security and international affairs establishment prefers, irrespective of whether this particular bogeyman has any basis in real-life facts. these renditions are preferred because they support policy recommendations – and in particular, defense appropriations – which the establishment wants to see approved by the white house and by congress. i do not mean to suggest that all articles fit this generalization because occasionally dissenting views are allowed some space, especially if they are badly argued. but the great majority does fit this mold and the american people are the big losers by this disservice because the public, including the expert community, is deprived of objective examinations of these very important and powerful countries. in turn, these distorted analyses actually can turn these countries into existential threats to the united states by provoking dangerous reactions to american policy even when russia or china had no aggressive intent in the first place. because of this imbalance within elite policy circles, there is a cluelessness within the u.s. media and among the popular pundits who are given air time and print pages. because they tend

""i talked to him about ukraine and the need for us to get things done,"" obama told a press conference in peru, on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation (apec) summit. ""i urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with france, with germany, with ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up."" russia backs a separatist, pro-moscow insurgency in eastern ukraine that has claimed nearly 10,000 lives. moscow, which annexed crimea from pro-western ukraine in 2014, denies either sending troops or weapons across its border to fuel the conflict, despite eyewitness testimony to the contrary. german chancellor angela merkel and french president francois hollande launched efforts in october to revive a stalled peace process during talks with putin and ukrainian leader petro poroshenko in berlin. those involved are trying to draw up a roadmap for applying the frayed 2015 minsk peace accords following months of impasse. the shock election victory of donald trump in the united states has been met with trepidation in kiev because of the mogul's praise for putin.

Article 5 - trump tower, a home for celebrities and charlatans
pre-opening reports of prince charles and princess diana moving in turned out to be false, but that didn’t stop mr. trump from using them to his advantage. the “sale that never occurred,” as mr. trump called it in “the art of the deal,” was “the one that most helped trump tower.” trump tower, at 721-725 fifth avenue, opened to the public on feb. 14, 1983, when the man who would become the 45th president was in his first flush of flame. it was 58 stories, but that didn’t stop the developer from promoting it as a 68-story building, to the chagrin of its chief architect, der scutt. the first 19 floors housed commercial enterprises; the first residential floor, the 20th, is listed as the 30th. with its grand atrium, made largely of italian brecchi perniche marble, and with retail tenants that eventually included gucci, landau jewelry and the trump store, the building is not exactly homey. “when we were there, most people seemed to own more as an investment,” said marina fareed, who lived there recently with her husband, qazi shaukat fareed, a pakistani diplomat. “it was not full-time people.” photo the completion of a grand tower in midtown’s high-end retail district cemented mr. trump’s status as a force to be reckoned with in

Article 6 - books in brief: nonfiction
capitalism russian-style by thane gustafson. cambridge university, cloth, $54.95; paper, $19.95. for decades, russia has been a screen on which american paranoia, fears and dreams have been projected: the red scare, cold war skulduggery, nuclear nightmares and, for the last several years, free-market fantasies. russia's experiment with capitalism came to an abrupt and ugly halt in the summer of 1998, when its currency cratered and its economy collapsed. today, amid various corruption scandals and an uncertain political landscape, there is vigorous debate about whether russia's economy is on the rebound. this argument is not merely academic nor is it the stuff of boring economics texts; the stability of a vibrant, captivating country still chock-full of nuclear weapons depends on its economic recovery. so for anyone interested in an engaging, sweeping tour of the russian economy in the 1990's and a framework for understanding the complicated financial and political dynamics at work in russia, thane gustafson's ''capitalism russian-style'' is a superb guide. gustafson, a professor of government at georgetown university, tackles his subject with authority and grace, offering bounteous facts and anecdotes that never drag down his narrative or his argument. while clearly taking financiers and public officials in russia and the west to task for the failed economic policies of the 1990's, gustafson is optimistic about russia's future

Article 7 - medvedev speech sparks rumor of putin’s return
moscow — president dmitri a. medvedev’s state of the nation address went on for 85 minutes and contained more than 8,000 words, but the section that prompted the most chatter on thursday was a single sentence, the one that proposed lengthening the russian president’s term to six years from four. the proposal in the televised speech on wednesday sounded odd, coming from a man just six months into his first term, and he offered little insight into his motive. it has led to rumors that mr. medvedev was laying the groundwork for his mentor, vladimir v. putin, the former two-term president who is now prime minister, to return as president, perhaps as early as next year. thursday’s issue of vedomosti, a respected financial daily newspaper, fleshed out this theory in all its conspiratorial glory. citing an unnamed source close to the presidential administration, vedomosti reported that mr. putin intentionally placed mr. medvedev in the presidency “to carry out the necessary constitutional changes and unpopular reforms for putin to then return to the kremlin for longer.” the newspaper theorized that mr. medvedev would resign and call for a presidential election in 2009. dmitri peskov, a spokesman for mr. putin, called the report “nothing more than the speculation of a newspaper.” advertisement continue reading the main story “mr. medvedev is in the initial stage of his presidency

Article 8 - how is hamid karzai still standing?
we walked into the domed mausoleum where two recumbent gravestones were covered with pink plastic flowers: “my father’s grave,” he said, lowering his voice to a whisper. “he was shot dead leaving a mosque. and that, by his side, is ahmed wali, my half brother.” he didn’t bother saying what we both knew, that ahmed wali karzai, the head of kandahar’s provincial council, effectively governor of kandahar and the man suspected by the west of controlling part of the afghan heroin trade, but who also helped the c.i.a. operate an anti-taliban paramilitary group, was himself killed by a trusted member of his inner circle. the shooting took place not far from where we were standing, two years earlier, almost to the day. i asked if anyone else in the family died violently. “many!” mahmood replied. he pointed to the different grave plots: “one, two, three . . . altogether about eight. maybe more.” from the graveyard, we headed on into karz, where the brothers spent their childhood. low mud-brick houses flanked the road. “imagine having to live in these conditions!” mahmood said. “if i had my way, i’d demolish the entire village, rehouse everyone in apartments and turn this space over to agriculture.” after decades in the united states, where he started an afghan

“that the newspaper, a pillar of the french left, should pick the american ambassador to tell parisian intellectuals what to go see or hear was nothing short of remarkable,” the new york times said in a 1981 profile of him. “not since benjamin franklin has an american envoy to france been given such public recognition for his culture.” arthur adair hartman was born on march 12, 1926, in flushing, queens, to joel hartman, who owned a paper mill, and the former may weinstein. he graduated from bayside high school, served in the army air corps in asia in world war ii, returned to graduate from harvard university and left law school to join the marshall plan administration in europe. his next step was the foreign service, and he served in saigon in the 1950s. before being posted to paris, mr. hartman was under secretary of state for economic affairs in the 1960s and assistant secretary of state for european affairs under henry a. kissinger. elegant and intellectual, mr. hartman was described in the times profile as “silver-haired, tall, and with a slight stoop that is more purposeful — it is, after all, necessary to communicate with shorter people — than deferential.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe

A Shift in Global Politics: A New Era of Tensions

The world is witnessing a significant shift in global politics, with several key players vying for influence and power. The United States, once the sole superpower, is facing challenges from emerging nations like Russia and China.

In recent years, the US has been grappling with its own internal issues, including the decline of its nuclear industry. The country's enrichment corporation, which was once a major player in the global market, has closed one of its plants due to rising costs and competition from more efficient facilities in Europe.

Meanwhile, Russia is experiencing a period of nostalgia for its past glory, particularly under the leadership of Fidel Castro, who was seen as a thorn in America's side during the Cold War era. However, this nostalgia is not enough to mask the country's growing economic instability and corruption scandals.

The US has also been engaging in a series of diplomatic efforts to resolve long-standing conflicts, including the Ukraine crisis. President Barack Obama has urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to reach a settlement before his term ends, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande have launched their own initiatives to revive a stalled peace process.

In other news, Trump Tower, once a symbol of luxury and exclusivity, has been embroiled in controversy over its past occupants. The building's developer, Donald Trump, has faced criticism for his business practices and personal life.

As the world navigates this complex landscape, it is clear that the old rules

A Web of Deceit: Uncovering the Hidden Agendas Behind Global Events

In recent years, a series of events has unfolded with alarming frequency, leaving many to wonder about the true intentions behind these global occurrences. From the collapse of the Soviet Union to the rise of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, it appears that powerful forces are at play.

A pivotal moment in modern history was marked by a promise made by US President George H.W. Bush to Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev, which would shape the course of international relations for decades to come. However, this promise has been repeatedly denied, leaving many to question its validity.

Meanwhile, the world witnessed a series of devastating attacks, including the Las Vegas shooting and the Sony hack, which were attributed to North Korea's involvement. However, recent revelations suggest that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had access to North Korea's networks before these events, casting doubt on the official narrative.

In another shocking development, it has emerged that the Trump Organization is set to open a luxury hotel and casino in Pyongyang, with the US purchasing the Ryugyong Hotel for $850 million. This deal has sparked concerns about the true intentions behind this agreement, which may be more than just a simple business transaction.

Furthermore, experts have warned of an impending ""purge"" on Inauguration Day, citing signs that suggest something is amiss. With tensions between the US and Russia escalating, it appears that the world is on the brink of
