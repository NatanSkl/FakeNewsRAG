""the press has become increasingly cynical, savage, cruel and insensitive,"" he said. but hasn't he contributed to that cynicism, by the kind of tales he traffics in? nonsense, he said. for one thing, he argued, his work has not just exposed celebrity sexual foibles, it

Article 2 - aarp aims to show marketers what they are missing in overlooking the consumer over 50.
ken dychtwald, president at age wave in san francisco, said, ''if that notion were real, i would be sitting here in thom mccann shoes, have a chevy impala parked in my garage, be wearing a timex watch, have brushed my teeth with crest and, for a little arthritis in my shoulder, i would have taken st. joseph aspirin.'' ''all of which is ridiculous,'' mr. dychtwald said, noting that he drives an aston martin and wears a cartier watch. ''there's not one product that i use today that i was using in my late teens.'' still, marketers may resist the idea that they, in effect, have no clue what they are doing and that by pursuing the young just threw away much of the $249.2 billion spent last year on advertising, the estimate from robert j. coen of universal mccann. while acknowledging the aging of the country and the rising wealth of older americans, some said their priorities were driven simply by the elusiveness of young people. ''the big concern hasn't been reaching the older audience, it's been reaching the younger audience, because they're not just sitting there in front of their televisions,'' said andrew donchin, director for national broadcast at carat usa, part of the aegis group, which buys advertisements for clients including club med, intel and adidas. even though seniors are increasingly physically active, they are also watching more television and

''if you are a woman, and you want to have a life of your own,'' advised the painter stella bowen, ''it would probably be better for you to fall in love at 17, be seduced, and abandoned, and your baby die. if you survived this, you might go far!'' she did not heed her own counsel -- she was 24 when she fell for ford madox ford, who was too busy being unfaithful to have the time to leave her, and their baby flourished. nor did she marshal the strongest part of her case: you will also be doing your biographer a great favor. the alternative, as bowen saw it in 1941, was a life of domestic servitude, from which there is no return. this fate too she managed to escape, though not without casting an enthusiastic vote for hearth and home. which is how bowen has found her way into ''stravinsky's lunch,'' a volume that acknowledges what we might have suspected all along: ''to be obliged to tackle other people's problems, or merely to cook their meals, the moment one lays down pen or brush, is intolerably hard. what one wants, on the contrary, is for other people to occupy themselves with one's own moods and requirements;

Article 4 - trial in firebombing of refugees exposes far-right grip in germany
turning on the taps is unlikely to cause injury or even death, as arson might, but is just as certain to cause hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage and to keep migrants from being moved in. the first arson case to gain attention nationwide occurred in the northern bavarian village of vorra in december 2014, when someone set fire to a renovated shelter that was about to receive 40 refugees. almost a year later, four refugee families moved into the re-renovated property. but no one was ever arrested for the fire. tracking anti-immigrant attacks is difficult, in part because of germany’s splintered federal system. but the amadeu antonio foundation, a respected nongovernment source, compiles lists culled from news media and police reports nationwide. advertisement continue reading the main story during the week of jan. 24, for instance, it found 10 suspected racist or right-wing assaults, including an arson on jan. 25 that damaged two houses intended for 25 asylum seekers in witten, in north rhine-westphalia. the trial of mr. l. and his friends, which is taking place in the city of hanover, has similarly exposed a worrying attraction to far-right ideas. the men were said in court to have been among the members of an online chat room known as swastika garage. photo several witnesses testified that a favorite pastime for the two men was drinking heavily and listening to right-wing rock bands

Article 5 - 8.3
disaster! the great san francisco earthquake and fire of 1906. by dan kurzman. illustrated. 296 pp. new york: william morrow. $25. on april 18, 1906, at 5:13 a.m., san francisco and the surrounding region of northern california was hit by one of the biggest earthquakes in history, rated by experts now as an 8.3 on the richter scale. survivors said the sensation was as if they were on a storm-tossed small boat trying to navigate through a nightmare. one patrolling policeman remembered: ''valencia street not only began to dance and rear and roll in waves like a rough sea in a squall, but it sank in places and then vomited up its car tracks and the tunnels that carried the cables. these lifted themselves out of the pavement, and bent and snapped.'' buildings swayed and toppled, killing and injuring hundreds of people asleep in their homes and hotels. soon fires, ignited by overturned lanterns and cooking stoves, began in the wreckage, then spread quickly through old wooden houses and office buildings. the shock had broken water mains, and san francisco's corrupt city government had not taken the advice of the fire department chief to ensure that adequate neighborhood water reserves would be available to fight a large-scale conflagration -- the city had been destroyed several times before when fires had raged out of control. the california national guard and united states army troops from the

photo robert hughes was a large, ruddy, passionate man with a mordant, propulsive prose style, an acid sense of humor and a keen appreciation for the ridiculous in american culture, a quality that is never in short supply. he was also an art critic for time magazine for 30 years; the author of more than a dozen books, including a best-selling history of australia, “the fatal shore”; host of a television tour of modern art, “the shock of the new”; and an avid fisherman. i knew the man, and i liked and admired him, although i did not always share his opinions about art and artists. “the spectacle of skill” is a compilation of selected writings by hughes with new material from the unfinished memoir he was working on when he died in 2012. the collection’s title is taken from a passage in an earlier book about his life, in which he tells the story of the horrific car accident that nearly killed him in australia in 1999, as well as the legal wrangling and lurid press coverage that followed. his fellow aussies in the media cast him as “a vile elitist,” an uppity, vainglorious her­etic to the egalitarian faith of the continent known as oz. answering the charge, hughes writes: “i am completely an elitist, in the cultural but emphatically not the social sense. i prefer the good to the bad, the articulate to

The language used in both summaries is also similar, with a focus on self-awareness, critical thinking, and challenging one's own assumptions. There are no clear contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and the claims made by the author are supported by the themes present in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","The articles discuss various topics, including the nature of reality, personal development, and societal collapse. 

Article 1 highlights the concept of being a ""prisoner of the voice"" in one's mind, where individuals are slaves to their programmed emotions, traumas, and fears. It emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and challenging one's own thinking.

Article 2 explores the idea of a ""crumble"" rather than a collapse, suggesting that societal change may be more gradual and subtle. The author encourages critical thinking and questioning of assumptions.

Article 3 discusses the need to rise up against oppressive systems and parasitic forces that control individuals. It emphasizes personal empowerment and the importance of recognizing one's own power as creators of reality.

Article 4 critiques modern society, suggesting that it is built on false ideals and manipulated by those in power. The author advocates for a new culture and civilization that values truth and individual freedom.

Article 5 defines the ""truth movement"" as a collective effort to seek and understand truth, rather than being bound by mainstream narratives or ideologies. It encourages critical thinking and questioning of authority.

Article 6 warns about the manipulation of spiritual predispositions and the suspension of critical abilities, suggesting that individuals must be aware of these tactics and resist them.

Article 7 discusses the importance of letting go of petty concerns and desires that can hold individuals back from achieving their goals. It emphasizes the need to focus on what is truly important in life.

Article 8 explores the concept of the ""path of the artist,"" which is unique in its lack of explicit cosmology or preordained content. The author highlights the importance of individual freedom and creativity in this path.","The articles discuss various topics, including politics, philosophy, and history. 

Article 1 discusses the shift in conservatism from its traditional values to a more fundamentalist mindset, threatening the world. The author argues that this new approach is hostile to pluralism and tolerates no diversity of views.

Article 2 addresses the feeling of hopelessness among some individuals, particularly after the US election. However, it emphasizes that retaining humanity amidst darkness requires holding onto democratic principles, the rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary.

Article 3 profiles Confucius, who believed in a person's character and ability as the basis for governance. He advocated for education open to all levels of society and opposed hereditary privilege.

Article 4 critiques the US election process, describing it as a ""crumbling empire"" with a corrupt corporate culture. It emphasizes the importance of retaining humanity amidst the negative aspects of modern society.

Article 5 explores the concept of virtues in everyday life, citing various lists of seven items. The author discusses the four cardinal virtues and theological virtues, highlighting their significance in human affairs.

Article 6 discusses the rise of tribal nationalism and its connection to inequality and cynicism. It emphasizes the importance of holding firmly to democratic principles, the rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary.

Article 7 examines the origins of the Cold War, focusing on Henry Kissinger's role as a key architect. The article highlights Natan Sharansky's mock trials of Kissinger and George Kennan, who opposed the American insistence on Soviet emigration.

Article 1 - prisoners of the voice
prisoners of the voice headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! elva thompson, guest waking times “what, then, is the soul but a prisoner of your flesh? an undying yet constrained energy, bound and enslaved within a shuffling, steadily rotting suit of tissue and savage needs?” – david wong we are all prisoners of the voice in the mind we are all prisoners of the voice in our minds, and slaves to our programmed emotions, traumas, fears, intellect, ambition and the ‘poor wronged little i’. many people identify their ‘ego i’ as being the centre of their universe, and the ‘i am so and so’ and ‘i do this’ is who they are, lock, stock and barrel. the personality and its ‘whirled’ is the total sum of their awareness- the only thing that is real in terms of the five senses. constant replay i spends its days busy thinking about its hopes, dreams, chores, agendas and how they can be achieved. ‘i am’ revisits the past, dwells on grievances, betrayals and sleights which replay over and over again in the present along with all the feelings and sensations of the original event. most of us are in mind all the time, our thoughts are crowded with fear and expectation, we worry about tomorrow – what if we lose our job and what is going to happen to us and our loved ones in the future…

Article 2 - perhaps a crumble rather than a collapse – chapter one
(before it's news) perhaps a crumble rather than a collapse – chapter one by cognitive dissonance why even question the obvious? when contemplating a complex subject, especially one in which i hold a strong emotional investment, i find it extremely valuable to seriously and consistently challenge my own thinking, to play devil’s advocate with my oftentimes emotional mind. a ‘truth’ untested, particularly one i’m emotionally bound to, is little more than a belief, a comforting factoid that confirms my biases rather than enlightening and informing my mind. if i am to progress in my personal development i must test the mettle of my beliefs up to, and if need be well past, their destruction. for only then can i truly be free to exercise, and honor, my personal sovereignty on an everyday basis. so it is that i’ve been considering the concept of ‘collapse’ with regard to society and its socioeconomic system(s), both on a personal and collective emotional and psychological basis. while it is always dangerous to paint detailed pictures with broad brushes, to some degree or another we are all emotional human beings. so while the cognitive details may vary (greatly) from person to person, our tendencies and triggers are very similar (partly because of a shared and distorted worldview) and relatively easy to discern if we have the courage to first look deeply within and then apply what we have found to the world around us. a word of warning here because this article is not a technical or fundamental economic analysis

rise (before it's news) if i see another “petition” asking for the selected “powers that shouldn’t be” to do this or that i’m gonna spit nails. it’s ridiculous. the very positioning of the populace into a place of “petitioning” others to get things done only reinforces the matrix of control and deceit. the answer is to rise up. this is done individually most of all, and collectively, as a result. the ptsbs are parasitic fleas on the back of humanity trying to direct the movements and mindset of the body. it’s insane. this comes into perspective when you realize you are the creator of the reality around you. it’s an immense realization and empowerment awaiting any truth seeker. we are what we project, and we project what we perceive. if the importance of awakening can be encapsulated into anything it’s that. if that seems too esoteric for you then dig deeper and wake yourself up. without awakening, we are swimming in a futile state of induced cause and effect within carefully circumscribed limits. petition attrition it’s honestly hard to believe even semi-conscious active humans still have the mindset to “ask” others to perform what needs to be done, to either bring to public discussion, pass laws or acknowledge the obvious. just think about it. when the obvious is obvious do you need validation from some outside “authority”? what more validation do you need than your experiential facts? this is why small subcultures existed in

Article 4 - lee duigon -- oblivion, here we come
oblivion, here we come by lee duigon july 23, 2015 newswithviews.com so how’s this for something to do, to keep busy? tear out the heart of your culture, hold a fire sale of its ideals (“everything must go!”), and then fill up the gaping wound with ideas and practices that virtually the entire human race has condemned and rejected throughout all of history. that’ll work! it’s got to! after all, nobody knew anything until sometime in the 1990s. before that, everyone was wrong about everything. almost everyone is still wrong about almost everything, but now at least we’ve got real smart intellectuals and scientific experts who are always right and all we’ve got to do is listen to them, and obey. with this in mind, along comes the learning channel with “all that jazz,” a schlockumentary about a “transgendered teen… as she [it’s really a he] balances school, family, and her [he is not a her, in fact] social life,” yatta-yatta. okay, so we’re going to have a new culture, a whole new civilization that’ll be so nice to live in, you just won’t believe it. but first our glorious leaders and culture-shapers are going to have to discard a few of those old traditions that hold us back from achieving utopia. these must go. here are some of the ones that must go, like, right away

Article 5 - how understanding the truth movement may hold many answers for humanity
(before it's news) with all the mainstream media mental junk food now feeding humanity almost daily guaranteed lies in order to secure the stated agendas of the new world order, i want to pose a divider question. that’s a name i made up for a question that is sure to divide people. nevertheless a question that deserves attention and consideration from all critical thinkers and truth seekers. today i pose this simple question only because it cuts through much of today’s subjectivism, it tramples on people’s belief systems, religions, opinions, political persuasion and some day it may even determine whether you live or die. it’s a question we should all be able to answer with understanding and conviction because when we do we’ll realize that doing can unlock many answers for humanity. the question is- what exactly is the truth movement? yes, on the surface it may seem like a silly or trivial question. but is it really? sadly and unfortunately many people especially in america are actually trained and thoroughly brainwashed into thinking that the truth movement is nothing but “conspiracy theorists” and all rest that comes with that engineered mass mind conditioning. if you believe this way i encourage you to forget what you’ve been told and think on your own for once. for those awakened and seeking truth let us spend some time answering this question or attempting to put this concept in perspective. first off, truth is realized. no one has a patent on truth, not myself, not anyone in the truth movement. anyone can be wrong about

Article 6 - big brother is not looking out for you
big brother is not looking out for you (before it's news) “your spiritual predispositions and ideals are being greatly manipulated at this time. there are entire teachings being introduced into the world now that teach human acquiescence and the suspension of critical abilities and value only that which is pleasurable and comfortable. these teachings are given to disable people’s ability to access knowledge within themselves until people reach a point where they feel they are completely dependent upon greater forces that they cannot identify. at that point, they will follow whatever is given them to do, and even if they sense something is wrong, they will no longer have the power to resist.” we are looking in the wrong direction and sending the wrong message to the universe. stephen hawking is admirable, not merely for his earlier, prescient views about life in the universe, where he notes the comparison with the history of native peoples on earth. his reversal now on the merits of broadcasting into space ignores the widespread evidence of the alien presence already in our world, and so he misses the begging question, why is the presence kept secret? “there are indeed forces at hand that are not benevolent and are using human beings for purposes that do not support the well-being of humanity.” – greater community visitations kudos for hawking to have concern about the content of the message sent out, yet we continuously and blindly broadcast the equivalent of a brain dump out into space. either with hawking we think we are alone — forgetting

Article 7 - let go of the little things in life
let go of the little things in life headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! we all know what it is like to be held captive of the little things in life — those petty concerns and small desires that steal their way into how we look at our lives and pit us against anyone or anything seen as trying to take away our anticipated desire. here is a short list of these little troublemakers that often make big trouble for us whenever we mistake them for being our friends: unrealistic expectations that others should treat us only as we imagine they should strong attachments to even the smallest and strangest of our possessions pressing convictions that no one else sees things as clearly as we do nagging resentments from relationships past and present perfect certainty that no one is permitted to interrupt our pleasures how can we say for sure that these conditions are little more than big nothings in the scheme of things? we have all been through those telltale moments in our lives when, due to a crisis of some kind beyond our control, we are momentarily able to see where we had lost sight of what was really worthwhile. perhaps we are the kind of person who is always complaining about some small ache or pain, and then we suddenly learn that someone we love faces a life-or-death challenge. maybe we think that we are the only one on earth who suffers emotionally in the way that we do, and then comes that moment when, in lashing out at someone for being so uncaring about our situation,

a break from reality: the path of the artist % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! a break from reality: the path of the artist by jon rappoport “the artist invents new space, where there wasn’t space before, and then he creates new energies there. artists produce unprecedented dimensions and worlds.” (the magician awakes, jon rappoport) among all spiritual paths described by teachers, now and in the past, the one represented by artists is unique. quintessentially unique. why? because—and this is vital to understand—the path of the artist has no explicit cosmology, no preordained content, no catalog of wisdom. in other words, no prior meaning has been imposed on it. this is not a path replete with its own metaphysics. no one is in charge of the path. for all these reasons, the path of the artist is not normally recognized as being spiritual. and yet it is. it is forged in freedom, and it has been established by artists from the dawn of time, from the moment the first human scratched the first drawing on the wall of a cave. he was saying, “reality is not final.” “the wisdom of the clan isn’t the only wisdom.” he was saying, “this path is for the individual.” who knows what price he paid for his daring? but he opened the way for all artists to

Article 1 - where the right went wrong
“the conservatism i grew up around” sullivan writes on the second page of the book, “was a combination of lower taxes, less government spending, freer trade, freer markets, individual liberty, personal responsibility and a strong anti-communist foreign policy.” his heroes were thatcher, reagan, solzhenitsyn, havel, hayek and orwell. but over the past few years, he argues, something new has usurped conservatism and threatened the world — religious fundamentalism. it is a mindset more than a faith, sullivan argues: “its core is not the individual conscience, but god himself, and the decision of the individual to surrender himself to god entirely as the premise of every action he commits and every decision he makes.” the fundamentalist, sullivan continues, is hostile to pluralism, feels alienated from society, surrenders to authority and is untroubled by doubt. “the fundamentalist does not tolerate a diversity of views. there is one truth; and all other pretenders are threats to it, or contradict it.” sullivan periodically distinguishes between the muslim fundamentalism of the terrorists and the christian fundamentalists he says now dominate the republican party, but he sees them as part of the same continuum, and often leaps between the two. he argues that nazis, communists, wahhabists and certain orthodox protestants, catholics and jews are all fundamentalists. he throws osama bin laden onto the fundamental

Article 3 - hey, character and ability!
whether chronicling the lives of leaders, inventors, artists or athletes, russell freedman presents his subjects both in the context of their extraordinary accomplishments and as individuals whose vision and values ran counter to the prevailing wisdom and prejudices of their time. the moral might be that the truly great are true to themselves, no matter what. certainly this was so for confucius, who was born around 551 b.c. living in a time of corruption and unrest, when feudal lords fought among themselves, taxes were high and peasants often starved, he believed ''the right to govern . . . should depend on a person's character and ability, not on his birth.'' a revolutionary idea. he also believed that if education were open to rich and poor alike, class distinctions would soon disappear and governments would be run by the most able people. ''confucius was searching for an enlightened ruler who would allow him to put his ideas about government into practice,'' freedman writes. ''he never found one.'' instead, confucius became a teacher, accepting students from all levels of society. a true visionary, he attacked hereditary privilege and espoused the idea of harmony in human affairs, achieved through the daily practice of courtesy and respect toward others. he also opposed ''doublespeak.'' asked what he would do first if he had political power, confucius replied: ''i would start using honest language. without a doubt, i'd want to call things by their right names. . .

a small treatise on the great virtues the uses of philosophy in everyday life. by andré comte-sponville. translated by catherine temerson. 352 pp. new york: metropolitan books/ henry holt & company. $27.50. a martian who knew some of our literature and religion but nothing about our bodies might be forgiven for thinking that people have seven fingers. why else would they be so puzzlingly keen to make lists of seven items? we have -- or had -- seven deadly sins, seven wonders of the world, seven liberal arts, seven sages of greece, seven virtues, seven sacraments and (if we are highly effective people) seven habits. the list of lists could go on and on, and most of the collections would be as arbitrary as these, er, seven. the virtues, to be sure, almost didn't make it. in plato's day, there were just four cardinal ones: justice, courage, prudence and temperance. but luckily christianity came along and brought the total up to quota with a convenient trio of theological virtues: faith, hope and charity. today, it seems, we are more demanding or ambitious. andré comte-sponville counts no fewer than 18 in ''a small treatise on the great virtues'': the four cardinal virtues, one theological one (namely love, of which charity, in its christian sense, is a variant), plus politeness, fidelity

Article 6 - the rule of law a reboot for democracy
struggling, like so many others, with the overwhelming sense of despondency at trump’s election, compounding the lingering depression of brexit, as one tries to find some explanation for the spreading darkness of the tribal nationalism that seems to be pervading so many of the countries long viewed as the bastions of progressive society, it is too easy to offer the cloak of alienation from the “ruling class”, or even of ignorance, to those who, with their votes, are welcoming the leaders of this regression. undoubtedly, inequality, so accentuated in recent times, plays a significant part. however, what is common to the success of such leaders is their cynical and dangerous plumbing of the depths of the most negative facets of human nature. the veneer of civilisation, painstakingly applied over so many years by the now seemingly distant voices of enlightenment, ever brittle, has become fractured, allowing those who seek to do so – trump, farage, johnson, le pen, et al – to prise open the fissures, breathing the oxygen of negativity on to the malevolence which had been so precariously contained, fuelling the hostility towards whatever factions happen to present themselves as enemies of convenience. how vital, therefore, that we hold firmly to those tenets of true democracy, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. it is a sad reflection on the state of america that the supreme court has become so politicised. as our supreme court faces its stern

Article 7 - who put the ‘cold’ in cold war?
photo back in the mid-1970s, natan sharansky and his fellow soviet dissidents bitterly amused themselves by conducting mock trials of henry kissinger, the architect of the détente policy that left them feeling abandoned. sharansky, as judge, would sentence kissinger to exile in the soviet union without benefit of the jackson amendment, which pressured the soviets to permit jews to emigrate. one can scarcely imagine the punishment he would have meted out to george kennan (1904-2005), the diplomat-scholar who laid the foundations for the cold war policy kissinger later executed, and who, we learn from john lukacs’s elegant and elegiac biography, sharply opposed “the american insistence that the soviet union facilitate emigration of its citizens in accord with some american preferences.” sharansky would not have been surprised to learn that kennan also felt “fairly at home” in berlin in the years before america’s entry into world war ii, and “regretted” our involvement in the war (though he later wrote that the holocaust was sufficient reason to fight germany). kennan’s unillusioned and often bleak assessment of america’s capacity to shape the world according to its wishes was, save for a brief period at the dawn of the cold war, too harsh a medicine for washington’s policy makers to swallow. americans, as kennan was grimly aware, are enamored of

Article 8 - depiction of lyndon b. johnson in ‘selma’ raises hackles
“everybody has to take license in movies like this, and it can be hard for nit-pickers like me to suspend nit-picking,” diane mcwhorter, the author of “carry me home: birmingham, alabama: the climactic battle of the civil rights revolution,” said in an interview. “but with the portrayal of l.b.j.,” she continued, “i kept thinking, ‘not only is this not true, it’s the opposite of the truth.’ ” fierce debates over the historical accuracy of movies, amplified by the heat of awards season, are nothing new. in 2013, kathryn bigelow’s “zero dark thirty” was denounced as endorsing torture. steven spielberg’s “lincoln,” another best picture nominee that year, drew criticism from historians who said it promoted an outmoded “great man” view of history and ignored the crucial role of african-americans in emancipating themselves. the dispute over “selma,” the first major feature film squarely about dr. king and the rare studio offering directed by an african-american woman, may have particularly charged present-day resonances. julian e. zelizer, the author of the new book “the fierce urgency of now: lyndon johnson, congress and the battle for the great society,” said it recalled the moment in the 2008 primary when mrs. clinton declared that dr. king’s dream of equality only “began to

(before it's news) boston’s children’s hospital has taken custody of 15-year-old justina pelletier, against her parents’ will. the teen has been there for nine months now. years ago, doctors diagnosed justina with mitochondrial disease, which causes loss of muscle control. despite this diagnosis, justina was able to live a happy, and relatively normal life with her family in connecticut. she was very active and enjoyed various sports such as ice skating. when she got the flu last february, she was taken to boston children’s hospital. justina hasn’t left since. doctors at boston children’s hospital claimed that justina has somatoform disorder, not mitochondrial disease. somatoform disorder is a mental disorder — not a physical one, like mitochondrial disease. after this diagnosis was made, the girl’s parents wanted to bring their daughter home — but officials would not allow that. lou and linda pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by security personnel. only four days later, they found out they had lost custody of their daughter due to “both parents’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans.” they are heartbroken and furious. “it is kidnapping,” lou pelletier said. lou and linda insist that they were never “resistant” towards treatment for justina. they had closely followed medical procedures and

Article 6 - suspicious kid suspiciously bailed out
cornal county, texas — justin carter, a terror suspect who has spent the last 5 months and his 19th birthday behind bars following some “terroristic threats” he made on facebook, was released last friday after a mysterious anonymous donor posted his $$500,000 bail. the donor refused to give his name, and it is as yet unknown whether or not the donor finished the phone call with maniacal laughter and the stroking of a pussycat. carter’s case has been a magnet for controversy, as it combines two things the public fears and distrusts most: teenagers and technology. justin was arrested after a concerned canadian citizen came across a comment he made on facebook, during an argument over a video game “league of legends”: “i’m f–ked in the head alright, i think ima shoot up a kindergarten “and watch the blood of the innocent rain down “and eat the beating heart of one of them.” justin immediately followed up the post with words “lol” and “jk” – a complex code that the investigating officers have been unable to decipher. the large anonymous donation which freed carter has roused further suspicion, as county prosecutor jennifer tharp put it: “we thought maybe he was just a kid too, but now someone hands over half a million bucks for him, next thing you hear his lawyer, donald h. flanary iii is representing him for free – what sort of links does the kid have

Article 1 - sides debate web access in libraries
''when a library buys books,'' mr. smith said, ''it chooses the books one by one.'' but the internet contains ''all the content ever created under the sun,'' he said. to require libraries to deny access selectively to the internet would be ''the end of the public forum doctrine,'' he said. under the supreme court's first amendment precedents, the government may not restrict speech in a public forum without a compelling interest and a policy narrowly tailored to serve that interest. but it was clear that these particular first amendment precedents were not the only ones in play this morning. in another line of cases, the court has also given the government considerable, although not complete, latitude in the types of speech it chooses to subsidize and in the strings it attaches to its largesse. the government distributes more than $200 million a year in grants and subsidies that give public libraries discounted internet access, and mr. olson suggested that a library system that wanted to offer unimpeded access could establish a separate operation that would not accept federal money. at the same time, he said, a library receiving federal money, as nearly all do, could not designate one of 10 computer terminals in a branch as an unsubsidized unfiltered computer. ''the government can decide how it wants its money spent,'' he said. the children's internet protection act is the latest in a series of efforts by congress, dating from the mid-1990's, to shield children from sexually explicit material on the

Article 2 - case of 8,000 menacing posts tests limits of twitter speech
in a complaint filed in federal court in maryland, the federal bureau of investigation concluded that mr. cassidy had published 8,000 twitter posts, almost all of them about ms. zeoli and her buddhist group, along with similar posts on several blogs. mr. cassidy’s lawyers with the federal public defender’s office argue that even offensive, emotionally distressing speech is protected by the first amendment when it is conveyed on a public platform like twitter. legal scholars say the case is significant because it grapples with what can be said about a person, particularly a public person like a religious leader, versus what can be said to a person. eugene volokh, a law professor at the university of california, los angeles, offered an analogy: the difference between harassing telephone calls and ranting from a street-corner pulpit. “when the government restricts speech to one person, the speaker remains free to speak to the public at large,” mr. volokh argued. certainly mr. cassidy’s previous trespasses have not helped him. he has a record of assault, arson and domestic violence. according to the federal complaint, he was also convicted of carrying an unspecified “dangerous weapon” onto a plane in 1993. but the defense has taken pains to point out that across the internet, people post things that may cause emotional distress to others: an unkind review of a book on amazon, even an unvarnished assessment by a college

Article 3 - despite news reports, task force finds online threat to children overblown
the internet may not be such a dangerous place for children after all. a task force created by 49 state attorneys general to look into the problem of sexual solicitation of children online has concluded that there really is not a significant problem. the findings ran counter to popular perceptions of online dangers as reinforced by depictions in the news media like nbc's ''to catch a predator'' series. one attorney general was quick to criticize the group's report. the panel, the internet safety technical task force, was charged with examining the extent of the threats children face on social networks like myspace and facebook, amid widespread fears that adults were using these popular web sites to deceive and prey on children. but the report concluded that the problem of bullying among children, both online and offline, poses a far more serious challenge than the sexual solicitation of minors by adults. ''this shows that social networks are not these horribly bad neighborhoods on the internet,'' said john cardillo, chief executive of sentinel tech holding, which maintains a sex offender database and was part of the task force. ''social networks are very much like real-world communities that are comprised mostly of good people who are there for the right reasons.'' the 278-page report, released tuesday, was the result of a year of meetings between dozens of academics, experts in childhood safety and executives of 30 companies, including yahoo, aol, myspace and facebook. the task force, led by the berkman center for internet and society at harvard

Article 4 - fan sites settle children’s privacy charges
as part of the registration process, the four fan sites asked users to submit personal details including their birth dates that would enable members to create online profiles, post messages and sign up for newsletters about the pop stars, the complaint said. because the sites therefore knew the children’s ages, the f.t.c. charged, the company had knowingly collected information and failed to properly notify their parents. “these were fan sites that knew that a very substantial percentage of users were 12 or under,” said david c. vladeck, the director of the f.t.c.’s bureau of consumer protection. “there is really no excuse for violations like these.” artist arena, a division of the warner music group that manages artist fan clubs, neither admitted nor denied the agency’s allegations. warner first invested in artist arena in 2007 and bought the company in 2010. james steven, a spokesman for artist arena, declined to comment. the fan sites no longer allow children under 13 to register as members. the proposed settlement comes at a time when the agency is preparing to extensively strengthen the children’s online privacy protection rule for the first time since its introduction more than a decade ago. in an effort to keep pace with innovations like mobile apps and facial recognition technology, the agency has proposed to widen both the kinds of data about children that would require parental consent and the kinds of operators — like advertising networks or data miners — whose activities could be subject to the rule. photo last week,

Article 7 - online cry for help

(the wolf who cried, “boy!”) when it comes to contacting forum administrators, different services have different policies. of the moderated forums on espn.com, patrick stiegman, the site’s executive editor, says: “our terms of service do not obligate us to review or respond to such issues — and the privacy policy would prevent it unless there was illegal activity

Article 8 - f.b.i. and justice dept. are faulted over child predators on web
washington, april 6 — lawmakers from both parties continued on thursday to question the commitment of the justice department and the federal bureau of investigation to halting the online exploitation of children. they also accused the agencies of failing to provide major witnesses for a congressional investigation into the matter. house members voiced their protest before and after testimony on the second day of hearings of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, part of the house committee on energy and commerce. the tenor of the hearings, which focused on law enforcement efforts to capture online predators and rescue child victims, signaled that a showdown might be imminent. ""we keep trying to cooperate with the justice department and the f.b.i.,"" said representative joe l. barton, republican of texas, the chairman of the full committee. speaking directly to william w. mercer, a united states attorney for montana who testified at the hearings, mr. barton said: ""you folks seem bound and determined to be as uncooperative as possible. i'm going to call the attorney general one more time, and we had better get the people we want to testify."" advertisement continue reading the main story mr. mercer testified that the caseload of the child exploitation section had increased 445 percent in the last four years, adding that federal prosecutions of child pornography and abuse cases increased to more than 1,500 cases last year from 344 in 1995.

Article 8 - the strangest of the strange ufo reports
(before it's news) submitted by chris holly on sun, 01/16/2011 the strangest of the strange ufo reports image by sterling_red i do not even know where to begin with this article as it is maybe the strangest group of ufo reports ever sent to me. since the reports came over a period of time from different people located all over the world i can only trust in what they are telling me and pass it on to my readers. obviously the people are seeing something very odd. since the reports are not related in any way yet very similar i can only think something new has come our way which we all need to be aware of. i will say that we should all be prepared for unusual reports as the activity in our skies continues to change and grow. i will admit these new sightings even took me off guard at first. once i was sent reports from people all over the world who did not know each other i knew something new was on the horizon. i had to wonder how many others may have seen something similar and felt it time to write about this floating building phenomenon. if you have seen something similar do email me with your report so this new strangeness can be brought forth as another unknown. a while ago i wrote a story about a large rectangle light seen over the field of a man who owns a huge track of land deep in the canadian wilderness. he came across a huge building size square object of solid light hovering over one of his fields

Article 1 - tropical storm leaves 16 dead in 2 gulf states
at the world's largest medical facility, the texas medical center near downtown -- a complex of more than a dozen hospitals and research laboratories -- dozens of volunteers worked furiously today to unload crates of dry ice to cool laboratory specimens put at risk by power failures over the weekend. claire bassett, a vice president at the baylor college of medicine, said thousands of laboratory animals, mainly rats and mice, had been killed when storm waters flooded their facilities overnight friday. ''we won't know just how bad the loss is until we can get in there, but we're estimating the losses of lab animals throughout the texas medical center at several thousand,'' ms. bassett said. but worse, she said, was the loss of scientific research and specimens flooded or destroyed when the power failed. one of those most affected by the loss was dr. bonnie dunbar, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at the college, who said she lost more than 20 years worth of laboratory specimens and clones. ''it's all gone, more than 20 years of work, and there are hundreds of other like me,'' dr. dunbar said. ''we've lost meticulous research, doctoral theses, experiment records, biological samples, all gone.'' dr. dunbar, who was to have left for kenya on monday as part of a fulbright scholarship program to perform pediatric h.i.v. research in africa, has also been displaced from her home: the rains knocked out power and telephones in

susana ramos, 35 and recently separated from her husband, lives in the inwood section of manhattan, in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in the back of the building, behind which black garbage bags pile up. she lives in that neighborhood to be close to her parents, so they can help her with her children when she is at work. three daughters — yamilette, 10, yaire, 9, and yarette, 5 — share a room with their brother, yahire, 7. there are three beds; yaire and yarette share. the baby, yanizmarie, 1, sleeps with her mother, while ms. ramos’s oldest daughter, daiylyn, 14, usually stays with grandparents. every evening, ms. ramos clips coupons. she has become so proficient, she says, that she can sometimes shave two-thirds off her grocery bill. coupons are just a small part of her routine. her work hours were just cut, but she still finds every moment packed. cooking, cleaning and helping children with their homework consume her days. in her scant spare time, ms. ramos is involved in activities at children’s aid’s dyckman valley early head start program in public school 152, which yanizmarie attends. ms. ramos is president of the parents committee of the head start expansion program and volunteers during many of the program’s events. “i have to be

Article 4 - finding in kung fu movies a refuge, and perhaps a calling
alejandrina cruz may be the only bronx grandmother with a kung fu movie collection to rival that of a subway salesman laden with cartons of contraband. ms. cruz, 65, lived in the city shelter system for more than three years while working to repair wounds left by years of physical and emotional abuse. during that time, she would stop weekly to visit an asian man at a plaza along fordham road in the bronx. there, she would dig $5 from her pocket and exchange it for a bootlegged copy of “fists and guts” or “chinese hercules.” titles like “iron neck li” and “dragon tiger gate” became the medicines that soothed the pains of the past. “i really love my karate movies,” ms. cruz said. ms. cruz came to new york from puerto rico at age 6. from the beginning, school was difficult. “i never found myself bright enough to be able to belong,” she said. she felt that her mind functioned differently from those of her friends, that her brain chemistry quickly became a stumbling block on the way to her future. there were no school counselors to diagnose a learning disability, no one to rework a curriculum for an unconventional student. “i grew up thinking, i cannot do this. i’m stupid,” she said. at 16, ms. cruz became pregnant. her partner was not supportive. “he used to choke me, and

Article 6 - 2 deaths haunt sleuth in a murder capital
the erect bearing and forceful voice of a police commander has been replaced by slouched shoulders and heavy sighs. she said her cigarette smoking has doubled and her blood pressure has soared. she is harassed by a pounding cough that sometimes makes her vomit. she cannot sleep. her hands, which once could wield a scalpel with the precision of a cosmetic surgeon, can barely tear meat from a piece of chicken. she tries to relax by working on a watercolor painting of her daughter. but mostly she sits in front of her computer typing letters to newspapers about the man she believes brought death to her doorstep. like a good cop, she has pored over crime files, studied photographs of the crime scene and autopsy reports. she has memorized the positions of each body on the sidewalk and the directions from which they were shot. she has watched for links to other shootings around the city, struggling to crack the most important case of her life. ''witnesses are too afraid to come forward,'' she said about murder cases generally. ''the dead tell more than the living.'' at ms. rodríquez's computer, an urn with her daughter's ashes sits next to the monitor. she is not religious, she said, but sometimes she hears her daughter shouting at her to keep up the search.

Article 7 - for family in shelter system, living from bench to bench
their grandmother and sole guardian, arlene cruz, 55, who gathered them from new jersey foster homes four years ago, now had to try to deliver them clean, fed and in uniforms to their manhattan public school, starting from a different shelter each morning. each afternoon they had to return to the din of the unit, to wait for the late-night bus to another bed. often the shelter assignment came way past bedtime, if at all. asked where they slept when no beds or benches were available, even ronald, the 6-year-old, could answer. ''floor,'' he said in an asthmatic growl. but jamall, 11, an honors student, could not speak. tears filled his eyes, and he was trying too hard to hold them back. ''he has the best understanding of what's going on,'' jamall's school counselor, alana reed, said later. ''he has a sense of responsibility for his siblings and his nana.'' for families like jamall's, the emergency assistance unit is the mandatory first step. it is perennially in violation of court orders to enforce new york city's right to shelter, and the city's commissioner of homeless services recently acknowledged that it functions as a kind of gantlet. ''i can't screw the front door any tighter,'' said the commissioner, martin oesterreich, referring to tough screening procedures adopted in 1996 to discourage any parent with a housing alternative from using the shelters as

Article 8 - a mother deported, and a child left behind
""there are millions of people who are illegally in the united states, and it's unfortunate, when they're caught, seeing a family split up,"" said william strassberger, a spokesman for federal immigration services. ""but the person has to be answerable for their actions."" federal officials said they leave time for parents to make arrangements for their children, and refer them to a social service agency if necessary. many parents arrange to leave american-born children with relatives or friends; others, especially those who have no one to assume responsibility for a child, take the children along when they are expelled. ""people refer to that as a sophie's choice situation,"" he said. ""where the child is going to be is left up to the parent."" as a practical matter, arrangements for a child left behind may be hasty at best, said janet sabel, who directs the immigration law unit of the legal aid society. one mother about to be deported to nicaragua last year was told to leave her four children with her husband, ms. sabel said. but the husband was an abusive drug user, and finally the mother persuaded the immigration officer to give her a few days to make other arrangements. a priest referred her to legal aid, which reopened the case, stopping the deportation. ""there's a happy ending to this story,"" ms. sabel said, ""but the fact is, there was total luck in her finding her way to us."" by all reports virginia

Article 8 - 10 corporations have a monopoly on almost everything you buy at the supermarket
10 corporations have a monopoly on almost everything you buy at the supermarket (before it's news) by vicki batts food and water were once considered to be basic rights, belonging to the individual. sadly, this is no longer the case. the rights to food and water have been sold off to the highest bidder, commercialized and turned into an industry. some might call it the bane of our health and wellness, others just call it big food. big food only sells us their food-like products at prices that make profits. perhaps if this industry was comprised of many small businesses, it wouldn’t be so bad. but, at least in western society, almost all of the food and beverages we buy are owned and operated by just a handful of companies. oxfam, an international confederation of charitable organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty, has created an infographic that illustrates how a small number of corporations have a monopoly on grocery store shelves. a mere ten companies have managed to usurp control of many popular foodstuffs and beverages. this includes nestlé, pepsico, coca-cola, unilever, danone, general mills, kellogg’s, mars, associated british foods and mondelez. each and every one of these companies makes billions of dollars each year in revenue, and have spread their presence across the globe. oxfam has said that it took action and showed people who is controlling the brands of food and beverages that they purchase as

Article 4 - investing; whole foods' run may slow
in fiscal 2001, whole foods added 9 stores; in 2002, it also added 9. so far this fiscal year, it plans to add 11. the company's head of real estate development died late in 2000, temporarily slowing the opening of new stores, said jim sud, an executive vice president of whole foods. he said that 27 stores are in various planning stages. with an average size of 43,000 square feet, they are more than a third bigger than the current store average. bigger stores have more room for the bakeries, seafood, deli counters and produce sections -- that is, the perishables -- that generate 65 percent of the company's sales. that compares with about 50 percent for the average supermarket, according to andrew p. wolf, an analyst at bb&t capital markets. the slowdown in store openings has not hurt earnings. in fiscal 2002, whole foods had net income of $1.40 a diluted share, or $84.5 million, compared with $1.21 a diluted share, or $67.9 million, a year earlier. sales were $2.7 billion, up from $2.3 billion. unionization could have a bigger impact, mr. wolf said, though so far workers in only one store have voted to join a union. in july, workers at the store in madison, wis., voted to be represented by the united food and commercial

“the market is pretty saturated right now,” said jessica caldwell, an analyst with edmunds.com. she noted that there were now 1.26 vehicles on the road for every licensed driver, more than ever. the downward sales trend is the latest challenge for the industry. tariffs could be imposed on cars made in mexico and canada if the trump administration negotiates major changes to the north american free trade agreement. manufacturers are also trying to push ahead with self-driving and electric vehicles even as it remains unclear how many they will be able to sell, and when. the effect of rising fuel prices is also a question mark. though still low by the standards of recent years, prices at the pump were $2.49 a gallon for regular gas on wednesday compared with $2.35 a year ago, according to aaa. the seven-year stretch of growth from 2010 to 2016 is the longest since the infancy of the automobile nearly a century ago, according to the automotive publisher wardsauto. it was born out of one of the industry’s darkest periods: the deep recession that prompted federally backed bankruptcy reorganizations of general motors and chrysler. at the low point, 2009, new-car sales plunged to fewer than 11 million a year. as sales climbed over the past seven years, carmakers had to worry little about keeping their plants humming. now they are faced with the prospect of trimming production and finding ways to entice customers to buy the vehicles

''we're decelerating very quickly,'' said jonathan basile, an economist at credit suisse first boston. ''there really isn't much, if any momentum.'' in fact, consumers have grown more worried this month about the nation's economic health, according to a preliminary survey released by the university of michigan. the survey's index of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in eight years. through november, those polled continued to say that the economy's condition then was strong, even as they predicted rough times in the months ahead. since late last year, though, people have also become concerned about the present, and most of this month's declining optimism reflected worries about the economy today. the preliminary april confidence index, which is based on a telephone survey of about 300 people, was 87.8, down from a reading of 91.5 in march and 108.3 in july 2000. the university of michigan will release a final result for april once it completes 200 additional interviews, recalculating the index based on their responses. the worries cut across income levels, said richard t. curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the university. reflecting the drop in stock prices, one-third of families with annual household income above $50,000 report being worse off financially than a year ago. and largely because of a decline in overtime hours, one-fifth of all families said their income had recently fallen. newsletter sign up continue

Title: what keeps a bottom line healthy? weight loss
Content: industry insiders have a name for the practice: the weight-out. it is a subtle way of earning more from everyday products without scaring off price-conscious shoppers, and it is quite legal as long as the package accurately describes what is inside. makers of candy, coffee and tuna fish have all tried weight-outs, with varying success. but the practice had been relatively scarce since the mid-1990's, largely because the cost of raw materials was low enough that manufacturers could afford to forgo price increases and still preserve the bottom line. now, however, the cost of production is rising -- expenses like energy, packaging, even ink. so weight-outs have slowly begun to resurface as a means of maintaining corporate profits without enraging customers, who are often none the wiser. ''we haven't encountered an environment like this in a long time,'' said emanuel goldman, a food and beverage analyst with ing barings. ''there's more resistance to raising prices than in the past, so you're going to get a lot more of these weight-outs.'' for instance, while holding prices steady, the perrier group, a subsidiary of nestle, has just completed a switch to five gallons from six for home deliveries of poland spring bottled water, a swap it plans for water-cooler jugs of its calistoga brand as well. in september, procter & gamble scaled back the number of disposable diapers in its luvs and pampers packages by an average of 13 percent, while cutting prices only 7 percent. company officials said the change, which, for example, comes out to eight fewer diapers in a jumbo pack that previously had 56, left parents with just enough diapers to get through the week, while providing procter a price increase for each diaper sold. kimberly-clark made a similar change to its huggies diapers almost immediately after procter & gamble acted, prompting makers of many generic diapers to do the same. advertisement continue reading the main story ''everyone in the diaper industry is downsizing to the same count,'' said tami jones, a procter spokeswoman. with consumers increasingly resistant to paying more at the supermarket, conditioned by years of low inflation to expect stable prices on everyday items, some experts predict that other consumer product companies will soon follow suit. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters.

India's dowry-related crimes have risen in recent years, with 8,233 women killed due to arguments over the custom last year. The conviction rate for such crimes is at 32%.

Entrepreneurship requires a positive attitude and thinking differently from society. A positive mindset can transform one's life and open up new opportunities.

India's trade ties with Pakistan are often exaggerated. The country has not seen significant economic growth, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to promote trade and commerce.

The practice of yoga in India is being misappropriated by Instagram influencers, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation. Many practitioners are confused by the disconnect between media portrayals and their personal experiences with yoga.

Article 4 - shikha dalmia: india needs to get over its prudish sexual attitudes
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! twice a year, in spring and fall, india’s hindus celebrate navratri, a nine-day festival during which they pray each day to a different female deity. navratri culminates in “kanya puja,” or a day of maiden worshiping: every household invites over the young girls of the neighborhood and, led by the father or patriarch, bows before them, washes their feet, prays to them, offers them a specially prepared feast of vegetarian delicacies and showers them with gifts and money. such veneration of women may surprise foreign observers of india, considering the recent epidemic of rapes there and publicity about the everyday harassment that indian women face—lewd gestures, catcalls, groping, and worse. but as shikha dalmia argues, it is precisely the stubborn hold of this prudish culture that has made many indian men so callow. view this article.

(before it's news) even though giving or receiving a dowry is illegal in india, as is murder of course, 8,233 women were killed there last year due to arguments over this age-old custom, according to the country’s national crime records bureau. in preparation for a marriage, a dowry can be bestowed upon the groom by the bride’s family in the form of money or property. the practice has been banned in india since the dowry prohibition act was passed in 1961. however, there has been a rise in dowry-related crimes in the country. sky news explains: loopholes in dowry prevention laws, delays in prosecution and low conviction rates have led to a steady rise in dowry-related crimes, women’s rights activists and police said. the conviction rate for such crimes is at 32%, according to the bureau. activist ranjana kumari said the dowry demands had intensified since india’s recent economic boom. she blamed a growing culture of greed as india opens its economy to foreign goods that the younger generation cannot afford but badly want. she said: “marriages have become commercialised. it’s like a business proposition where the groom and his family make exorbitant demands. “and the wealthier the family, the more outrageous the demands.” suman nalwa, a senior new delhi police officer dealing

Article 6 - the importance of a positive attitude
the importance of a positive attitude (before it's news) “the mind is like a parachute. it doesn’t work if it is not open.” – frank zappa being an entrepreneur doesn’t just mean you’ve started a company, it means you’ve set out to begin a conquest of success, failure, and overcoming your fears. one of the most important lessons i have learned is that you must think differently to become a successful entrepreneur. my largest struggle, when developing and creating ideas, has been to maintain a positive attitude and to stay focused on my vision for the longevity of the project. many think that “successful” people of this world have created their lifestyles because they were given more opportunities than others or they just have an extra bit of “luck.” this is a sad misconception in society and is simply not true. the thing that people need to understand about being an entrepreneur is that you have to think differently than the rest of society. you have to modify your thoughts away from life’s daily obstacles to the future you want and the solutions you want to create in your life. you have to release all negativity towards others and yourself and focus on the positive aspects of life. as you turn your thoughts from negative to positive, your life begins to transform and the world begins to open up to you. over the past few years, the positive mindset has been my biggest discovery. as a freshman in college, i worked on starting a company based on a new website concept for college students. i developed

pak-india trade ties—a myth (before it's news) pak-india trade ties—a myth shastra pooja (worship of weapons) and talking peace! s. m. hali narendra modi was elected as the prime minister because the business community reposed confidence in his acumen for promoting trade and commerce. he has been keen to live up to his election campaign promise of improving india’s economy through trade and investment. as chief minister of gujarat, modi had earned the dubious title of “the butcher of gujarat” for his alleged role in the genocide of over 2000 muslims in 2002 but his role in establishing gujarat as a success story in trade and commerce attracted indians to cast their vote in his favour to replicate gujarat’s trading experience nationally. modi’s home province of gujarat is known worldwide for its trading shrewdness. columbia university economist and indian origin scholar jagdish bhagwati affirms that modi possesses the “gujarati dna” of a trader. modi’s premise is that in the year 1700, india accounted for about a quarter of the world economy. today, it accounts for about 5% despite having some 17% of the world’s population; thus modi’s endeavour to reclaim that heritage. india’s 15th prime minister has made vocal and visible overtures to the west as well as china to make investments and establish trading

am i misappropriating yoga? (before it's news) the continued rise of instagram-influenced yoga has led to a new wave of criticism among east-indians and academics alike. accusations of cultural appropriation are being levied just as long-held myths are being debunked. many earnest practitioners find themselves confused by the discord between what they see and read in the media and the experience they have of yoga in their lives. i traveled to india in 1998. i spent three months there. i did not go to study or stay in an ashram. i went with no plan. just a backpack, a let’s go travel guide, and the hope that somewhere along the journey i might gain insight enough to decide whether or not to continue yoga as a life path or seek another direction formy livelihood. i had only one condition: stay off of the tourist track. and i definitely learned something important about yoga from my time in india. things i could never have learned from my previous two years of practice and training in new york city. aspects of yoga seemed to pervade the culture of india, in stark contrast to yoga’s obscure status back home in the us. i remember a conversation with a rare english-speaking local and the realization that many of my friends in ny who were attending kirtan regularly and, on some level considered themselves devotees of kali, would never be permitted in the kali temple in india. no amount of chanting or sari and bindi-wearing can get

all india | written by ishadrita lahiri | 45 ist email print comments the cash ban during peak wedding season has turned celebrations into a nightmare for families and traders new delhi: on a drive down the main road of west delhi's upscale rajouri garden, one sees a line of shops with colourful hoardings that scream out ""wedding band"". at this time of the year, the members of ""band-party"", as they are locally called, can be seen either practising or getting ready to head for the celebrations.this year, however, the shops appear deserted - a fallout of the government's currency ban that was announced by prime minister narendra modi on november 8.""i haven't received a single order since november 8. there are no bookings for january and february either,"" said pawan singh, the owner of one of the shops, who had been supplying horses, musicians and chandeliers to weddings for 12 years.the months between november and february are considered to be peak wedding season in north india and for those in the business, the currency ban could not have come at a worse time.with the two highest denomination notes turning to paper overnight, the last eight days have been nothing short of a nightmare, for both traders and the families that had a wedding around the corner.for mr singh, paying his workers has also become a problem as they can only be paid in cash. many families, he said, were insisting on paying with

Article 3 - as mores evolve, india’s divorced seek second chance
marriage is still, by and large, socially compulsory. but in a measure of the slow churning of indian social mores, divorce and remarriage are slowly gaining acceptability. “in general, it’s no taboo these days,” mr. raina said gamely, and went on to praise the anonymity that big cities in particular offered to those who wanted a fresh start. to get away from clucking tongues and wagging fingers, a divorced man, as mr. raina put it, “just has to change his house. from east delhi to south delhi, he is a new person.” the work of mr. raina’s agency, called the aastha center for remarriage, is not all that countercultural anymore. the matrimonial sections of sunday papers carry advertisements from other marriage bureaus specializing in second-timers. an internet portal was created six months ago, called secondshaadi.com — shaadi being the hindi word for marriage — and already has a database of 25,000 clients. even conventional marriage portals, like shaadi.com, are beginning to see listings from people who want to tie the knot a second time. sunil gangwani, who runs a shaadi.com branch in nagpur, a small provincial city in central india, said about 5 percent of his clients were divorced. divorce rates are difficult to quantify because cases are filed in local courts across the country, but there is anecdotal evidence of a rise. the

Article 4 - festival of lights, parade of sweets
this week, in a coincidence of calendars, hindus and muslims from india, pakistan and bangladesh are celebrating the most joyous holidays of the year. hindus observe the festival of lights, diwali, or deepavali, which ushers in the new year; muslims finish the holy month of ramadan with id al-fitr, which signals the end of the monthlong daytime fast and a return to the sweetness of daily life. the two holidays, hindus and muslims here say, are utterly soaked in sugar. ""you cannot go to anyone's house at this time of year without a quarter-pound of something sweet,"" says padma dasgupta, a writer in jericho, n.y. shristi mittal, a columbia student from delhi, recently shopped at foods of india for sweets and diyas, small pottery cups that are filled with wax or ghee and lighted at night during diwali. (diwali means row of lights.) ""if you have mithai and diyas, even a dorm room feels like india,"" she said. mithai are integral to many ceremonial occasions -- the first gift of an indian bride to the family of her betrothed is often 50 pounds of top-quality mithai -- but none more so than diwali, which is observed by sending elaborate gift boxes of sweets, dried fruit and nuts to family and friends.

Article 6 - vikram chatwal’s many-roomed getaway
it’s been a long and somewhat roundabout journey: after working in finance at morgan stanley and global emerging markets, mr. chatwal tried his hand at modeling (and, later, acting). it wasn’t until 1999 that he took up the family trade, opening his first hotel, the time, on west 49th street. mr. chatwal’s father, sant singh chatwal, had founded the multinational hampshire hotels management company. the younger mr. chatwal is founder of the dream, night and time brands within the debut hotel group division of the company, with 10 hotels around the world and more in the works, including a los angeles dream hotel that is scheduled to open early next year. hospitality isn’t the only area in which he has made a name for himself. he also developed a reputation as a hard-partying playboy, something his 2006 marriage to priya sachdev, an indian model and former investment banker, was intended to rectify. (their nine-day, three-city wedding in india, orchestrated by mr. chatwal’s father, was chronicled in the vows column of the new york times and in a new york magazine feature titled “vikram’s big fat sikh wedding.”) but the couple separated when safira was 4, and in 2013, he was arrested in florida for drug possession; the charges were dismissed after he completed a drug rehabilitation program. that’s all behind him now

Article 1 - reviving hillary’s vast right-wing conspiracy
reviving hillary’s vast right-wing conspiracy (before it's news) remember when bill clinton was still denying his involvement with monica lewinsky, and an indignant hillary went out to face the cameras on his behalf, imagining that his troubles were due to “a vast right-wing conspiracy”? well, fast forward fifteen years and she’s at it again, this time on behalf of her boss, barack obama, the incredible shrinking man who loves to take credit for everything (have you heard that he got osama bin laden?) but finds it impossible to take responsibility for anything (whatever it is, it’s still bush’s fault). following mitt romney’s elegant rope-a-dope of obama in their third and final debate of this election season, during which the republican nominee left the prosecution of the administration’s foreign policy blunders to others during the final days of their race for the white house, the president’s flailing re-election campaign finds itself confronting a whole new set of problems. while relying heavily on the complicity of the mainstream media to aid in a blatant cover-up concerning a planned terrorist attack on the american consulate in benghazi, libya on the anniversary of 9/11, obama has been desperate to run out the clock before voters can learn the truth about his incompetence and deceit. now he must try to explain a newly obtained e-mail message that clearly shows he has been lying all along to the american people about the attack, which killed

Article 2 - wsj: hillary clinton may not be the nominee
(before it's news) the strange election year of 2016 just keeps getting stranger… there are increasing rumblings within the party about how a new candidate could emerge at the convention. john kerry, the 2004 nominee, is one possibility. but the most likely scenario is that vice president joe biden—who has said that he regrets “every day” his decision not to run—enters the race. mr. biden would be cast as the white knight rescuing the party, and the nation, from a possible trump presidency. to win over sanders supporters, he would likely choose as his running mate someone like sen. elizabeth warren who is respected by the party’s left wing. where is president obama in all this? so far he has largely stayed out of the campaign, other than to say that he doesn’t believe mrs. clinton compromised national security with her home-brew email server. but with her poll numbers dropping, her legal headaches increasing, the sanders candidacy showing renewed vigor, and donald trump looming as a wrecking ball for the president’s legacy, mr. obama and adviser valerie jarrett might begin sending signals to the democratic national committee and to the vice president that a biden rescue operation wouldn’t displease the white house.

Article 3 - democrat civil war
(before it's news) must read on the obama destruction machine the hillbuzz gang. i do love them. (hat tip john) i was a democrat for 32 years before the heavy-handed push for obama alienated me from the party…and i borrow what hillary clinton said about republicans once, back when she was a goldwater girl, and will paraphrase by saying that i didn’t leave the democrat party, the democrat party left me. after it beat me to a pulp, called me a racist, berated and insulted me, and used alinsky rules to hit me with everything it had. not just me, but all hillary supporters. this is the part i don’t think you understand because i don’t know if you and your listeners paid much attention to what the obama campaign and dnc did to malign and assault hillary clinton’s supporters during the 2008 campaign. none of this has been forgotten by any of us. if you have not seen it already, rush, you need to watch gigi gaston’s documentary “we will not be silenced 2008″. i’m featured in a segment on the voter fraud that was committed in the iowa caucus back in january of 2008. while i was always aware democrats use unions and other means to cheat in elections, i never knew the democrat party was capable of the large-scale, aggressive, unapologetic fraud it committed on obama’s behalf

Article 4 - hillary clinton now blaming obama for election loss
hillary clinton is now pointing her finger at the eight years of former president barack obama as a reason she couldn’t campaign on an “agenda of change” and conceivably win the 2016 election. obama actively campaigned for his former secretary of state throughout the election campaign. in an interview posted wednesday with radio host hugh hewitt, clinton bemoaned being seen as an extension of the obama years. “it is true that when you run to succeed a two-term president of your own party, you have a historical headwind blowing against you,” clinton told hewitt. “it’s not just this campaign can be set apart from everything that’s ever happened in our politics. it is a challenge.” clinton suggested her campaign suffered from mixed messaging. “if you are both the candidate defending a lot of the areas of agreement, but also putting forth an agenda for change, which is what i tried to do, it is often difficult to get the second part of that message through.” not that she wanted to distance herself from obama. “i was proud to serve in the obama administration. i did not agree with everything that president obama decided, but on balance, i really think he did what had to be done to rescue the economy, which as we all remember, was in desperate straits,” clinton said. the former first lady also suggested that she is far from finished with public life. getting into the spirit

fbi director comey gets an unexpected defender % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) well, joe biden is nothing if not helpful: biden told cnn’s michael smerconish he’s not worried about comey being unfair. “i’ve found him to be a straight guy. he’s a tough guy. he’s a republican, but he’s always been straight and i’m confident that this will turn out fine,” the vice president said. he urged the fbi head to release the emails publicly. “i think the quicker they release the emails for the public to see them the better off.” this is hilarious. first off, biden has to begin and end each day kicking himself in the ass for not seeking the nomination this year. earlier this week a rumor was floated, almost certainly by the biden camp, that hillary was looking at him for secretary of state. the clinton camp promptly shot down this trial balloon. i can’t blame her, really. though the video of him engaging in a tickle fight with angela merkel would be hilarious. biden is doing his best to make life just a little bit tougher on the clinton campaign and, at this point, he probably doesn’t care whether they sink or swim… making him much like the rest of the democrat establishment. the post fbi director comey gets an unexpected defender appeared first on redstate. source: http://www

Article 8 - lessons from an etch a sketch
lessons from an etch a sketch (before it's news) america stands at a crucial place in our history. as we look forward to restoring some kind of sanity to our nation, four candidates remain in the fray to take on president obama, although one would be hard-pressed to find a journalist reporting this as anything other than a two man race at this point. while many have already crowned mitt romney the republican nominee, i am reminded of what governor palin told us over two months ago. she said that, contrary to what some would have us believe, the mainstream media and president obama actually want to face romney in the general election. class warfare specialist that he is, the president is salivating at the chance to depict the front-runner as an out-of-touch elite with no ability to relate to the average, everyday, struggling american. romney, of course, hasn’t helped himself, as he has provided gaffes for the left to add to their storehouse of ammunition. mitt romney’s achilles heal, romneycare, became obamacare, and no one knows that more than president obama. romney’s chief weakness is certainly not lost on the president, nor will it be dismissed. when–if–the time becomes right, president obama will use it masterfully. can romney endure? the truth is many people are simply not sure where romney stands or even if he’ll be able to stand. the “etch a

Article 1 - you love me? vote for her! obama hits frontline for clinton
washington (afp) - how do you gift your popularity to someone else? as barack obama rolls up his sleeves to ensure hillary clinton succeeds him in the white house, his argument increasingly boils down to a simple message: do it for me. with approval ratings almost unheard of for an outgoing leader -- 54 percent, according to the latest gallup average -- the democratic president is hitting the trail full-time to help clinton lock in crucial battleground states in the final stretch of the race. obama's time this week is devoted almost exclusively to drumming up the vote for his former secretary of state in a marathon that started tuesday in columbus, ohio, heading wednesday to raleigh, north carolina, on to miami and jacksonville, florida on thursday and finally back to north carolina's charlotte on friday. his stump speech is well-rehearsed. it starts with an avalanche of compliments for hillary, summed up thus: ""there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not bill, nobody -- more qualified than hillary clinton to serve as president of the united states of america."" and it includes an arsenal of pointed attacks on her rival donald trump, in a nutshell: ""the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president."" but obama -- who is well aware that clinton struggles to whip up passion in the electorate -- also regularly takes the conversation into more personal territory, linking her political future

Article 2 - obama urges unity after election day: 'we are americans first'
washington ― president barack obama reminded a stunned nation on wednesday morning that people across the country “are americans first” and encouraged younger generations to not be “cynical.” obama stood in the white house rose garden to deliver remarks hours after donald trump was declared the president-elect of the united states. obama, who said he had spoken to trump on wednesday morning, promised to make the transition between his administration and trump’s as seamless as possible. “everybody is sad when their side loses an election. but the day after, we have to remember we’re actually all on one team,” obama said. “this is an intramural scrimmage. we are americans first; we are patriots first.” a peaceful transition is key, obama said, because everyone is now “rooting for [trump’s] success in uniting and leading the country.” “a peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy, and over the next few months we are going to show that to the world,” he said. everybody is sad when their side loses an election. but the day after, we have to remember we’re actually all on one team. this is an intramural scrimmage. president barack obama obama said he was “heartened” by his conversation with trump, who agreed that unity was important after such a bitter election cycle. “that’s what the country needs,” obama said. “a

in a speech in ohio shortly after the polls closed in wisconsin, she alluded to what her campaign considers mr. obama’s lack of experience, and his support for a health insurance plan that would not initially seek to cover all americans. “this is the choice we face: one of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world,” mrs. clinton said in the remarks, which she also planned to expand upon in a speech in new york city on wednesday. “one of us has faced serious republican opposition in the past — and one of us is ready to do it again.” mrs. clinton did not mention the wisconsin results; she did, however, call mr. obama to congratulate him on the victory. as mrs. clinton was speaking, mr. obama appeared on stage at a rally in texas, effectively cutting her off as cable television networks dropped her in midsentence, a telling sign of the showmanship power of a front-runner. “houston, i think we achieved liftoff here,” mr. obama told a crowd of 20,000 people in that city as he hailed the voters of wisconsin. “the change we seek is still months and miles away, and we need the good people of texas to help us get there.” photo with 90 percent of the electoral precincts in wisconsin reporting, mr. obama had 58 percent of the vote to mrs. cl

Article 4 - the authentic power of michelle obama
barack obama can’t play that part, not at this exact moment, in his precise mood. on the stump in ohio last week, he essentially asked voters not just to reject trump but to punish the g.o.p., and his obvious, warranted glee over the party’s travails had a score-settling, told-you-so quality to it. he excoriated republicans for the “swamp of crazy that has been fed over and over and over and over again.” he told them that trump is the nominee you get when your agenda is “based on lies, based on hoaxes.” he wasn’t merely safeguarding america’s future. he was reveling in his revenge. michelle obama probably also wants revenge for the worst of what her husband (and she) went through, but you don’t hear that in her words. that’s largely because she has the luxury of not being a politician. she isn’t and won’t be running for anything. she hasn’t been forced to weigh in on a bevy of issues, potentially alienating voters who disagree, or to exhaust her ammunition on a range of fronts. you want high approval ratings? exit elected office, or never enter it in the first place. but in addition to that, she has honed a talent — rare in washington — for rising above pettiness, and she and her speechwriters have aced a nuanced, soulful alternative to common reproach and garden-variety ranc

Article 5 - clinton wins primary, keeping bid alive
but she quickly put out a call for supporters to donate to her campaign, noting that “we can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively.” she urged viewers to visit her web site and “show your support.” amid chants of “yes she can” — a riposte to mr. obama’s motto, “yes we can” — mrs. clinton described herself as “a president who is ready to lead on day one. that means ready to take charge as commander in chief and make this economy work for middle class families, and i thank you, i thank you pennsylvania, for deciding i can be that president.” photo mr. obama congratulated his opponent at a tuesday night rally in evansville, ind. but he also implicitly chided mrs. clinton for the negative tone of her attacks over the past week — and, tacitly, acknowledged his own missteps. “it’s easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit-for-tat that consumes our politics, the bickering that none of us are entirely immune to,” he said. “that trivializes the profound issues — two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril.” he added that americans “believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics.” looking to capitalize on mrs. clinton’s performance in pennsylvania, her campaign spent t

Article 6 - crowds shower president with the star treatment
mr. clinton may well be a detested figure in some parts of the country. and he may well turn off swing voters and energize the republican base, as the gore campaign has calculated. but none of that was on display yesterday as mr. clinton stuck to solidly democratic turf -- ''i'm preaching to the saved,'' he noted at one point -- while trying to boost the fortunes of al gore's presidential campaign and hillary rodham clinton's senate bid. ''why are new yorkers so fanatically loyal to president clinton?'' fernando ferrer, the bronx borough president and likely mayoral candidate, asked in introducing the president. ''the answer is simple: for the first time in my lifetime, there has been someone in the white house who has felt comfortable with people like us.'' others seemed to agree. the focus was supposed to be on mr. gore and mrs. clinton, both of whom are locked in tight races, but the democrats who turned out yesterday could not help repeatedly invoking the name of mr. clinton. ''you can't help but love the guy,'' said tecala t. hall, a social worker and democratic activist. ''he gets down with the people. gore isn't quite there yet, but i want him in the white house. he'll get there.'' fred judd, a union advocate from brooklyn and a fervent backer of mrs. clinton, said her connection to the president

Article 7 - harry reid hopes to ensure democrats’ success as tenure winds down
throughout the lunch, mr. reid fired off the kind of observations that have, for better and worse, marked his soon-to-end career in washington. jeb bush, the florida republican expected to run for president, would be the “easiest opponent” for hillary rodham clinton to beat in 2016, mr. reid said. “he’d have to wake up every morning and find out what he’s for,” mr. reid said. not to mention the record of president george w. bush. “how can his brother jeb get away from that?” mr. reid said. “i’ll take clinton baggage over that any day.” he said president obama wasted 18 months in his first term trying to accommodate political intransigence from republicans, but suggested the president would nevertheless be remembered as the best chief executive in at least 50 years, presumably including bill clinton, the husband of the woman likely to be the 2016 democratic presidential nominee. he called mrs. clinton, the secretary of state under mr. obama, the obvious favorite to win the presidency, for one overwhelming reason: “this is the time for a woman to run.” “women and some men, like me, if they are anything like me,” he said, “they have come to the realization that women have qualities that we’ve been lacking in america for a long time, to be the leader of the country.” “

Article 8 - running for office? the president has some ideas
the president is particularly engrossed in the first lady's race, and to a lesser degree in mr. gore's. but his involvement in campaigns from coast to coast is extraordinary. mr. clinton is much more than a fund-raiser in these campaigns, even as he has collected millions of dollars for house and senate candidates. he offers candidates pointers on television and radio advertising scripts. he played a significant role in urging some prospects to run in the first place, and he often schedules trips and policy announcements with an eye to helping specific contenders. this portrait of mr. clinton has been gleaned from interviews with more than two dozen candidates and strategists, as well as lawmakers on capitol hill and officials at the white house and at the democratic national committee. joe lockhart, mr. clinton's press secretary, turned down a request to interview the president; some of mr. clinton's advisers said they were worried that it would seem unpresidential for him to discuss his activities openly. ''he's the ultimate junkie,'' said senator robert g. torricelli of new jersey, chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee. ''he has the best walking knowledge of anybody in american politics.'' referring to representative ron klink's drive to oust senator rick santorum of pennsylvania, mr. torricelli said: ''last night he called me about the klink race. he said he was convinced klink could beat santorum. he said, '

Title: you love me? vote for her! barack obama hits frontline for hillary clinton | zee news
Content: you love me? vote for her! barack obama hits frontline for hillary clinton last updated: wednesday, november 2, 2016 - 22:31 0 follow @zeenews washington: how do you gift your popularity to someone else? as barack obama rolls up his sleeves to ensure hillary clinton succeeds him in the white house, his argument increasingly boils down to a simple message: do it for me. with approval ratings almost unheard of for an outgoing leader -- 54 percent, according to the latest gallup average -- the democratic president is hitting the trail full-time to help clinton lock in crucial battleground states in the final stretch of the race. obama`s time this week is devoted almost exclusively to drumming up the vote for his former secretary of state in a marathon that started tuesday in columbus, ohio, heading wednesday to raleigh, north carolina, on to miami and jacksonville, florida on thursday and finally back to north carolina`s charlotte on friday. his stump speech is well-rehearsed. it starts with an avalanche of compliments for hillary, summed up thus: ""there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not bill, nobody -- more qualified than hillary clinton to serve as president of the united states of america."" and it includes an arsenal of pointed attacks on her rival donald trump, in a nutshell: ""the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president."" but obama -- who is well aware that clinton struggles to whip up passion in the electorate -- also regularly takes the conversation into more personal territory, linking her political future to his own legacy. ""i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me,"" he urged supporters in his address to the democratic national convention in july. a few weeks later, america`s first black president went further by urging african americans to mobilize for clinton -- telling them he would ""consider it a personal insult"" if they fail to rally this time around.black voters traditionally lean heavily democratic in the united states -- and more than 90 percent voted for obama in 2008 and 2012. the crucial question facing the 69-year-old clinton is whether she can draw anywhere near the historic turnout levels among black voters seen for obama. and so the president is flooding the airwaves in the homestretch of the race, hammering home the point wednesday morning on the tom joyner morning show, a radio program whose audience is largely african american. obama cited the data coming in from early voting states, and issued a wake-up call: ""i`m going to be honest with you,"" he said. ""the latino vote is up. overall vote is up. but the african-american vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be."" it

dodging bullets (before it's news) even as the thanksgiving holiday, a celebration of plenty, hovers heart-warmingly close on the horizon, it’s impossible for me to ignore the unsettling notion that we are all, at best, dodging bullets now. it is a matter of dumb luck where insane freak storms will strike. thinkprogress ran a frightening review , titled “we are poisoning our weather”, about the new ipcc report on this subject. of course it’s even worse than that, because the scope of our poisoning goes far beyond merely weather, lethal as that can be – and into worse realms of sea level rise, ocean acidification, ecosystem collapse and health impacts from pollution…and even earthquakes from both fracking and ice sheets melting. but leaving that aside and sticking to just the weather for the moment, here’s the first episode in an excellent new series about events around the world – of which we can anticipate many more. an endless resource, unlike others we’d rather have! it’s not fiction – but it equals the best hollywood disaster movie effects. what’s interesting to me about the fallen branches and trees depicted in the east coast blizzard, causing public fury with power company officials following days and weeks without heat or light – leading in some cases to customers threatening utility workers – is that so many pine branches broke. nevertheless, the power companies claimed the toll was due to heavy snow on trees that were still leafed out too early in the season…and also this

Article 1 - panel’s warning on climate risk: worst is yet to come
“nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change,” rajendra k. pachauri, chairman of the intergovernmental panel, said at a news conference here on monday presenting the report. the report was among the most sobering yet issued by the scientific panel. the group, along with al gore, was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2007 for its efforts to clarify the risks of climate change. the report is the final work of several hundred authors; details from the drafts of this and of the last report in the series, which will be released in berlin in april, leaked in the last few months. video the report attempts to project how the effects will alter human society in coming decades. while the impact of global warming may actually be moderated by factors like economic or technological change, the report found, the disruptions are nonetheless likely to be profound. that will be especially so if emissions are allowed to continue at a runaway pace, the report said. it cited the risk of death or injury on a wide scale, probable damage to public health, displacement of people and potential mass migrations. “throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hot spots of hunger,” the report declared. the report also cited the possibility of violent conflict over land, water

Article 2 - five crucial things to watch for at the marrakech climate summit
hundreds of international negotiators will convene in marrakech, morocco, next week to kick off a two-week marathon of meetings on how nations will implement the paris agreement to avert catastrophic climate change, which goes into force on friday, nov. 4. they will be hammering out the details of the landmark climate treaty achieved last year in paris, which set several important goals for global climate action. in paris, the world agreed to keep the average global temperature increase to “well below” 3.6 degrees fahrenheit (2 degrees celsius) above preindustrial norms, and as close as possible to 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees celsius). to get there, 192 nations—rich and poor, developed and developing (and somewhere along the continuum in between)—agreed to restrict heat-trapping carbon pollution over the next several decades to “net zero,” keeping emissions at or below the capacity of ecosystems such as forests and oceans to absorb them and technological advances to store them. given that the average global temperature has already risen by around 1.8 degrees f, many observers felt the paris agreement was more than a little late in coming. but to the surprise and delight of its supporters, a surge of national ratifications in the past 10 months means that the agreement goes into effect just ahead of the nov. 7 start of the marrakech meeting. it’s a remarkably speedy adoption for a complex international treaty, said

mr. bush did none of those things, and his advisers rued that he did not, concluding that he paid the price for the rest of his presidency. whether any of that makes a difference for mr. trump remains to be seen. even with a more elaborate, inclusive process and an expressed willingness to consider alternatives, he does not seem to be winning over many of his opponents. that may be because they question his sincerity after his years of denouncing “global warming hoaxsters.” since mr. trump announced the pullout from paris, his aides have largely ducked questions about whether he still considers climate change to be a hoax. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story climate fwd: sign up for our newsletter to get our latest stories about climate change — along with answers to your questions and tips on how to help. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. pressed repeatedly on that question on “fox news sunday,” scott pruitt, the administrator of the environmental protection agency, said: “the president has indicated that the climate changes. it’s always changing. i’ve indicated the same.” but he did not say whether mr. trump believed that human activity contributed to

Article 5 - why the media must make climate change a vital issue for president trump | environment | the guardian
imagine the world was facing upheaval on a scale not seen during modern civilization, a change that would imperil the world’s great cities by the rising seas and snuff out species at at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs disappeared. then imagine you were a journalist, had repeated chances to ask the next president of the united states about this and decided to not do so. the apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated. but the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of donald trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future generations. this failure was most apparent during the presidential debates , where four-and-a-half hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to trump or hillary clinton on climate change. it was left to ken bone , he of the red sweater and brief internet fame, to come closest with a question about coal mining. the mind-boggling consequences of unchecked climate change, which is essentially what trump proposes by denying the problem exists, dwarfed every other issue – yes, including emails – discussed during the debates. and yet it wasn’t raised. it was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with churchill and roosevelt in 1942 and not asking them about the war. climate change was also missing in broader coverage of the election, especially on cable tv, where slow-moving scientific emergencies don’t make good fodder

Article 7 - cooling on warming
“a provision expressing the senate’s views on such a controversial topic as ‘climate change’ has no place in a supposedly noncontroversial resolution requiring consent of all 100 u.s. senators,” a cruz spokesman said. photo do you think everything in the world is now about senator ted cruz? sure seems like it. although i would discount the rumors that he is responsible for the helium shortage or the sinkhole epidemic. there was a time, children, when the republican party was a hotbed of environmental worrywarts. the last big clean air act of the bush i administration passed the house 401 to 21. but no more, no more. you’re not going to get any sympathy for controlling climate change from a group that doesn’t believe the climate is actually changing. as tom delay , the former house majority leader, used to say, “only nature can change the climate — a volcano, for instance.” it’s sort of ironic. these are the same folks who constantly seed their antideficit speeches with references to our poor, betrayed descendants.

Article 8 - the silence on global warming
exclusive: harrowing predictions of climate scientists are coming true, as glaciers melt, forests burn, heat waves proliferate and freakish weather strikes in unexpected places. but the propagandists of global-warming denial have succeeded in silencing most politicians and the mainstream press, writes robert parry. by robert parry something called a “derecho” a fast-moving line of thunderstorms strikes the washington area knocking out power for days. massive forest fires ravage colorado. a record heat wave covers much of the country. the u.s. press treats these events as major stories, but two words are rarely mentioned: “global warming.” what has become most striking about the growing evidence that climate change is a clear and present danger indeed an emerging existential threat is the simultaneous failure of the u.s. news media to deal seriously with the issue, another sign of how the right can intimidate the mainstream into going silent. we have seen this pattern before, as the right sets the media agenda by bullying those who threaten its ideological interests. before the iraq war, anyone who dared raise questions about the bush administration’s justifications could expect to be marginalized or worse. just ask phil donahue, scott ritter and the dixie chicks. during ronald reagan’s presidency, his hard-nosed propagandists dubbed this tactic “controversializing,” that is, anyone who got too much in the way could expect to be subjected to systematic smears and professional deconstruction. with

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Recent articles highlight the urgent need for awareness about various environmental and health issues. 

Article 1 discusses the IPCC report on weather poisoning, citing insane freak storms as a result of human activities. The article also mentions sea level rise, ocean acidification, ecosystem collapse, and health impacts from pollution.

Article 2 reports on record heat worldwide, with scientists baffled by new weather patterns attributed to photon belts, Nibiru, earth shapechange, and geoengineering. 

Article 3 critiques the ""whole creation stricken by corruption"" theme, referencing Romans 8:22-25 and Luke 6:43-45.

Article 4 reveals a connection between Bill Gates and Monsanto, including patent applications for chemtrails and geoengineering. The article also mentions climate scientists' involvement in these projects.

Article 5 discusses California's massive tree die-off, blamed on beetles but attributed to climate engineering by Dane Wiggington. The article highlights the impact of extreme heat, drought, and desiccant materials used in climate engineering programs.

Article 6 exposes the weather modification and geoengineering industry, listing companies, associations, and research related to these practices.

Article 7 reports on military spraying operations preempting rainstorms, with HAARP/Nexrad directed frequency weather modification and aerosol spray injection solar geoengineering causing California drought.

Article 8 reveals massive methane releases off Los Angeles coast and Jamaica's first days of March, attributed to tectonic plate movement.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles discuss various aspects of climate change and its impact on the world. 

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that the worst is yet to come in terms of climate-related disruptions, citing potential risks such as death or injury on a wide scale, damage to public health, displacement of people, and mass migrations.

The Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 3.6°C above pre-industrial levels, has been ratified by 192 nations, with many observers feeling it was late in coming given the current average global temperature increase of 1.8°C.

However, some environmental nominees have questioned the validity of climate change science, with one nominee stating that carbon dioxide is a plant nutrient and not a pollutant that directly affects human health.

The media's failure to cover climate change as a leading topic during the presidential election has been criticized, with many arguing that it was a missed opportunity to hold power accountable for the benefit of future generations.

A resolution in the US Senate expressing views on climate change has been met with resistance from some Republicans, who argue that the issue is not controversial and should not be included in noncontroversial resolutions.

The silence on global warming has become more pronounced, with many politicians and media outlets failing to mention the topic when discussing extreme weather events such as heat waves, forest fires, and power outages.

There are no significant contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary. The article also provides specific details, such as the US-backed assault on ISIS's stronghold in Raqqa being unlikely to succeed before Obama leaves office in January, which supports the reliability of the information.","The articles discuss the US government's actions and plans regarding terrorism, particularly in relation to ISIS. 

President Barack Obama is planning to launch an offensive against ISIS, with a focus on Syria as their breeding ground. However, critics argue that this plan does not go far enough in forming a unified global alliance against violent extremist organizations.

The US has already sent troops to Iraq and plans to send 300 military advisers to the country. In addition, Obama is considering bombing campaigns in both Iraq and Syria.

Some experts believe that an effective strategy should address ISIS as a worldwide problem requiring a worldwide policy. They suggest forming an organization similar to NATO to deal with violent extremist organizations.

The US government has tried various approaches to tackle terrorism, but critics argue that more needs to be done. The Obama administration's plan is seen as insufficient by many, who believe it does not go far enough in addressing the global threat posed by ISIS.

Overall, the articles highlight concerns about the US government's approach to combating terrorism and the need for a more comprehensive strategy to address this global issue.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

US President Barack Obama has authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He promised to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the group, recruiting a global coalition to support the effort.

Russia denies US claims that missiles aimed at Syria hit Iran, with Igor Konashenkov calling the report ""complete nonsense."" Iranian officials also dismissed the claim, describing it as part of Western ""psychological warfare.""

A US-backed assault on ISIS's stronghold in Raqqa is unlikely to succeed before Obama leaves office in January. The operation will likely take two months or longer to seal off and isolate the city.

Donald Trump's election has sparked concern among Syrian rebel groups, who fear his more open-minded stance towards Russia may lead to a shift in policy. Trump's campaign promises have also been seen as a recruitment tool for jihadists abroad.

US officials say that destroying ISIS may take years, with Secretary of State John Kerry stating that ""we have the ability to destroy"" the group. The military campaign will be built on a coalition effort, with no obvious precedent and no ground troops involved.

Overall, the articles highlight the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the challenges of defeating ISIS, as well as the shifting dynamics in US-Russia relations under Trump's presidency.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 2 - obama, in speech on isis, promises sustained effort to rout militants
video washington — president obama on wednesday authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against rampaging sunni militants in the middle east, including american airstrikes in syria and the deployment of 475 more military advisers to iraq. but he sought to dispel fears that the united states was embarking on a repeat of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. in a speech to the nation from the state floor of the white house, mr. obama said the united states was recruiting a global coalition to “degrade and ultimately destroy” the militants, known as the islamic state in iraq and syria. he warned that “eradicating a cancer” like isis was a long-term challenge that would put some american troops at risk. “we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,” mr. obama declared in a 14-minute address. “that means i will not hesitate to take action against isil in syria, as well as iraq,” he added, using an alternative name for isis. “this is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten america, you will find no safe haven.” the president drew a distinction between the military action he was ordering and the two wars begun by his predecessor, george w. bush. he likened this campaign to the selective airstrikes that the united states has carried out for years against suspected terrorists in yemen and somalia, few of which have been made public.

Article 3 - obama unlikely to see assault on islamic state's syria stronghold
by jonathan landay and phil stewart washington (reuters) - a u.s.-backed assault on raqqa, islamic state's de facto capital in syria, is unlikely to pierce the city itself before president barack obama leaves office in january, denying him the chance to claim the end of the group's ""caliphate"" as part of his legacy. although a u.s.-backed alliance of syrian armed groups announced the kickoff of the offensive on sunday, u.s. officials caution the fighters will first try to seal off and isolate the islamic state stronghold, a process that could take two months or longer. as a result, the victor of tuesday's u.s. presidential election almost certainly will inherit the job of routing the militants from the city from which they have run their shrinking territories in syria and iraq, overseen branches from west africa to south asia and plotted attacks in western europe and elsewhere. ""there is no available force capable of taking raqqa in the near future,"" said one u.s. official. another said some of the needed arab forces were still in training. like seven other officials interviewed for this report, they requested anonymity to discuss the issue. u.s. marine general joseph dunford, the top u.s. military officer, played down the idea that seizing raqqa would be quick or easy, saying the first job was sealing off the city.

12:51pm gmt trump arouses syrian rebel concern, ""cautious"" optimism in damascus rebel fighters drive their motorcycles, western aleppo city, syria november 3, 2016. reuters/ammar abdullah by tom perry and lisa barrington | beirut beirut donald trump's election as u.s. president on wednesday drew concern among syrian rebel groups and a degree of optimism in damascus, where his victory was seen as a better outcome than a hillary clinton win. syrian rebels have long been fiercely critical of what they perceive as the obama administration's inadequate backing for their fight against president bashar al-assad, though washington has been an important sponsor of the uprising. but trump's statements on syria, and his more open-minded stance towards assad's ally russia, have fuelled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on syria's conflict, in which the russian air force has been bombing insurgents. ""i think things will become difficult because of trump's statements and his relationship with putin and russia. i imagine this is not good for the syrian issue,"" zakaria malahifji, head of the political office of an aleppo-based rebel group, told reuters. the syrian opposition says obama failed to back them adequately after calling for assad to leave power, failing to enforce his own ""red line"" against the use of chemical weapons and blocking the

Article 5 - for jihadists, trump election brings a change in strategy
jihadists abroad say they will use donald trump’s election and appointments as powerful recruitment tool, pushing their claims that the west and islam are heading toward a clash of civilizations. this represents a pivot in strategy. for two decades, jihadists have largely used united states actions ­– such as wars and foreign policy – to support claims of an anti-islam agenda. now, they are anticipating that they will be able to use the words of administration officials themselves. a single tweet, insiders say, can be as big a recruitment boon as the iraq war. “for years we have focused on the palestinian occupation, america’s deceitful alliance with iran and [syrian president] bashar [al-assad] in the slaughter of sunnis in syria and the wars in iraq and afghanistan as proof that america, and americans, are waging a war against islam,” says abu omar, the nom de guerre of an al qaeda operative in syria aligned with the militant group jabhat fatah al-sham. “now all we have to do is turn to trump’s twitter account or turn on cnn.” recommended: how much do you know about terrorism? take the quiz. al qaeda, and likely the islamic state, say they will attempt to convince muslims living in the west that they are no longer welcome in their own society. they will depict jihadists as the sole protector of muslims’ interests. as

Article 7 - it’s a mad, mad, mad, mad world
in a political environment that stays thirsty for clear winners and losers and operates on a stopwatch, the syrian debate hasn’t satisfied, and is unlikely to. this debate is too serious to be subjected to the rules of washington’s game, even as it must be conducted by its gamesmen. it has broken down the normal tribalism of left-right, liberal-conservative constructs, and mixed folks into maddeningly contradictory coalitions. on one side are some of president obama’s staunchest supporters, who are always convinced that he’s the smartest man in the room, that he’s always playing chess when others are playing checkers. as someone tweeted to me on tuesday night, “i support my president and any decisions he makes.” she continued, “we elected him to do a job so we must pray for his discernment and allow him to do it.” for many like this woman, their faith in obama is resolute and unshakable. but, they have found kinship with conservative, hard-line war hawks who see an opportunity to alter the syrian civil war and place another imperial imprint on the region. their thirst for intervention will never be sated. their trigger finger is always itchy. their appetite for expansion knows no bounds. this is the might-makes-right crowd. on this side are also those who are simply convinced of the administration’s argument: that bashar al-assad used chemical weapons on his own people and that he should be

Article 8 - destroying isis may take years, u.s. officials say
“what i want people to understand,” mr. obama said in an interview with nbc ’s “meet the press” that was broadcast sunday, “is that over the course of months, we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum” of the militants. “we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities; we’re going to shrink the territory that they control; and, ultimately, we’re going to defeat them,” he added. the military campaign mr. obama is preparing has no obvious precedent. unlike american counterterrorism operations in yemen and pakistan , it is not expected to be limited to drone strikes against militant leaders. unlike the war in afghanistan , it will not include the use of ground troops, which mr. obama has ruled out. unlike the kosovo war that president bill clinton and nato nations waged in 1999, it will not be compressed into an intensive 78-day tactical and strategic air campaign. and unlike during the air campaign that toppled the libyan leader, col. muammar el-qaddafi , in 2011, the obama administration is no longer “leading from behind,” but plans to play the central role in building a coalition to counter isis. “we have the ability to destroy isil,” secretary of state john kerry said last week at the nato summit meeting in wales , using an alternative name for the militant group. “it may take a year, it may take two

Title: romney: obama's 'mistakes' have allowed isis to grow
Content: (photo: reuters/shannon stapleton) u.s. republican presidential nominee mitt romney waves after his concession speech during his election night rally in boston, massachusetts november 7, 2012. former massachusetts governor and 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney slammed president barack obama on sunday for not taking any action after receiving intelligence regarding the rise isis in syria over a year ago. romney told john catsimatidis on his radio show on wnym in new york, called the cats roundtable, that had obama acted upon intelligence reports that highlighted a strong presence of varying jihadist rebel terrorist groups' efforts in syria, it could have prevented groups like isis from seizing cities in iraq, a country the united states fought to liberate for over a decade. ""those mistakes were made and now we have isis. almost a year ago, american intelligence sources told the president that there was a group forming called isis … and there was significant chance that they would go into iraq and invade a city there,"" romney said. ""the president failed to take action. he watched. we saw isis roll into iraq. instead of attacking them immediately and not knocking them in their convoy, when it would have been easy to knock down, the president again watched. now we are in a position where isis has run throughout major portions of iraq. there have been horrific human rights abuses, tragedies including those upon american journalists. now we are in a difficult position."" fox news confirmed on tuesday through an anonymous former pentagon official that obama was given a detailed intelligence about the rise of the islamic state in presidential daily briefings last year before the jihadist group seized large amounts of territory. romney, who has adamantly said he is not running for president in 2016 but is still believed to be considering that option, pointed out that if america had voted him into office in the 2012 election he would have taken much more direct action to combat the territorial spread of isis, starting from when they were making headway in syria, to help moderate revolutionaries' revolt against the government led by president bashar al-assad. ""i laid out what i thought was a pretty good course for us to see stability in syria. had we followed that course, there is a good chance that we would not see an isis today,"" romney said. ""that course was to bring together the moderate revolutionaries that were in syria to make sure they were well armed. to assure the alawites that there would be a future in syria post assad. these kind of actions would have stabilized syria, at least i believe so. it would have prevented the growth of a group like isis."" romney also said that it is ""unacceptable"" to see such a major geographical and economical area like iraq being controlled by groups of radical jihadists. but in the last year,

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

US President Barack Obama has authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. He promised to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the group, recruiting a global coalition to support the effort.

Russia denies US claims that missiles aimed at Syria hit Iran, with Igor Konashenkov calling the report ""complete nonsense."" Iranian officials also dismissed the claim, describing it as part of Western ""psychological warfare.""

A US-backed assault on ISIS's stronghold in Raqqa is unlikely to succeed before Obama leaves office in January. The operation will likely take two months or longer to seal off and isolate the city.

Donald Trump's election has sparked concern among Syrian rebel groups, who fear his more open-minded stance towards Russia may lead to a shift in policy. Trump's campaign promises have also been seen as a recruitment tool for jihadists abroad.

US officials say that destroying ISIS may take years, with Secretary of State John Kerry stating that ""we have the ability to destroy"" the group. The military campaign will be built on a coalition effort, with no obvious precedent and no ground troops involved.

Overall, the articles highlight the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the challenges of defeating ISIS, as well as the shifting dynamics in US-Russia relations under Trump's presidency.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss the US government's actions and plans regarding terrorism, particularly in relation to ISIS. 

President Barack Obama is planning to launch an offensive against ISIS, with a focus on Syria as their breeding ground. However, critics argue that this plan does not go far enough in forming a unified global alliance against violent extremist organizations.

The US has already sent troops to Iraq and plans to send 300 military advisers to the country. In addition, Obama is considering bombing campaigns in both Iraq and Syria.

Some experts believe that an effective strategy should address ISIS as a worldwide problem requiring a worldwide policy. They suggest forming an organization similar to NATO to deal with violent extremist organizations.

The US government has tried various approaches to tackle terrorism, but critics argue that more needs to be done. The Obama administration's plan is seen as insufficient by many, who believe it does not go far enough in addressing the global threat posed by ISIS.

Overall, the articles highlight concerns about the US government's approach to combating terrorism and the need for a more comprehensive strategy to address this global issue.

House Republicans have added anti-environmental provisions to a funding bill, which would roll back the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The American Lung Association is urging Congress not to support these policies.

The Clean Air Act turns 40 this month, but its future is uncertain due to efforts by dirty energy proponents and climate change deniers to gut the law. 

House Republicans have unveiled a budget bill that includes provisions to block new environmental rules, including the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. The bill would also reduce EPA funding.

Chinese officials have reportedly given $350 million to a super PAC to sabotage Donald Trump's presidential bid and lobby for US-China trade deals.

The midterm election results indicate that Republicans will resist President Obama's agenda on energy and environment policy, potentially limiting regulations like those related to CO2 emissions. 

Carbon tax advocates are discussing post-election prospects, despite the fact that Republicans have historically opposed such a tax. However, some conservative leaders, including Grover Norquist, have expressed openness to a carbon tax if it is structured in a way that does not violate their pledge not to raise taxes.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has allocated millions of dollars for ""environmental justice"" programs, which aim to bring protection from health and environmental hazards to low-income communities.","Recent articles highlight various developments in US politics and policy. 

President Obama's State of the Union address emphasized affordable, high-quality child care as a national economic priority. His budget includes $200 billion for child care and early education over the next decade.

House Republicans are expected to vote on a proposal to water down the earmark ban, which was implemented in 2011 by former House Speaker John Boehner. The measure would allow lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a ""federal purpose.""

Governor George Pataki is seeking an extension of a state law governing the approval of new power plants, which expired on January 1. The law has divided state lawmakers, with Democrats calling for major changes and Republicans wanting to renew it as is.

President-elect Donald Trump's presidential pen could remake the Supreme Court's agenda by undoing policies implemented by his predecessor, Barack Obama. This includes cases involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care, and transgender rights.

Citizen petitions have been shown to be effective in identifying species that are biologically threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Public petitions face higher levels of biological threat than those identified by the Fish and Wildlife Service.

President Obama visited Flint, Michigan, months after a water crisis became apparent, where residents are still struggling with health and safety repercussions from drinking lead-tainted water. The visit was met with both good will and misgivings from residents.

Special interest money in politics is a contentious issue, with many Americans awakening to the ways that corporations benefit from tax cuts and no-bid contracts.

carbon tax advocates discuss post-election prospects; ignore lesson of plato’s republic (before it's news) the energy and enterprise initiative, an advocacy group headed by former south carolina republican congressman bob inglis, launched a new web site today: republicen.org. in an inaugural blog post, mr. inglis opines about the post-election day prospects for enacting a carbon tax: the timing couldn’t be better as far as we’re concerned. on election day 2014, republicans won the majority in the senate and increased their majority in the house, creating a huge opportunity for real conservative reform. . . . now’s the time to step up with free-market solutions and show the country that clean air and clean-energy innovation are best achieved by accountable free enterprise, not big government.” huh? what inglis means by “accountable free enterprise” is a carbon tax. republicans “won the majority in the senate and increased their majority in the house” despite tom steyer, environmental defense action fund, nrdc action fund, league of conservation voters, and sierra club spending an unprecedented $$85 million to elect ‘climate champions’ and unseat ‘climate deniers.’ consistent with survey research finding climate change to be among voters’ lowest priorities, the election results indicate that republicans are less vulnerable than ever to green attack ads. so why is now the time for a constructive republican alternative proposal that would raise energy prices, deny americans the benefits of affordable, plentiful,

Article 1 - the parent agenda, the emerging democratic focus
the most obvious places to see the new focus have been in mr. obama's state of the union address and his budget. the central characters in his speech to congress were rebekah and ben erler, the struggling parents of two young children in minneapolis. “affordable, high-quality child care,” mr. obama said, is “not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.” he added, “it’s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.” his budget — more of a wish list than a policy document, given republican control of congress — includes $200 billion over the next decade for child care and early education, along with $60 billion for free community college. he has already proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit. beyond washington, dozens of states have pursued expanded preschool in the last few years. although republicans have pushed some of the expansions, democrats — like bill de blasio, the new york mayor, who made the plan a centerpiece of his campaign — have been behind most of them. and mrs. clinton has signaled that many and perhaps all of these proposals will be part of her likely campaign for the democratic party’s presidential nomination in 2016. a recent commission on “inclusive prosperity,” containing several clinton allies, emphasized many of these proposals. “the united states, unfortunately

Article 2 - house republicans to vote on bringing back earmarks
joshua roberts/reuters house speaker paul ryan has been quiet about the issue but his conference is expected to vote wednesday on a proposal to water down the earmark ban. washington ― house republicans are expected to vote on whether to water down a key piece of former house speaker john boehner’s (r-ohio) legacy ― the 2011 ban on earmarks . the house republican conference on wednesday will consider a narrowly tailored amendment that would allow lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a “federal purpose.” the measure ― filed by reps. john culberson (texas), mike rogers (ala.) and tom rooney (fla.) ― would not allow members of congress to direct federal funding for recreational facilities, museums or parks. it would also require lawmakers proposing earmarks to be identified and their requests to originate in committee. “this makes sure the entire process is out in the sunshine,” culberson told huffpost in a tuesday interview. “it’s gotta go through the entire committee process. you’ve got to put your name on it and be proud of it. don’t hide your light under a bushel basket.” earmarks are congressional spending items for specific local projects, including, infamously, a “bridge to nowhere” in alaska that became a symbol of wasteful spending designed only to benefit its sponsor. republicans banned earmarks in 2011 after taking control

Article 3 - pataki seeks extension of power plant law
with just eight days left in the legislative session, gov. george e. pataki renewed his calls today for extending a state law that governs the approval of new power plants, adding yet one more item to a growing heap of legislative matters that seem unlikely to be resolved this year. in a 55-page bill, the governor sought to refocus public attention on an issue that has divided state lawmakers for more than a year. article x, which expired on jan. 1, created a separate regulatory process in 1992 for the approval of power plants that produce at least 80 megawatts of electricity. but state lawmakers have repeatedly deadlocked over renewing the law, and few people today saw the governor's efforts as bridging that gap. ''releasing anything on a friday afternoon, and so close to the last days of the session, you have to wonder how serious they are,'' said jason k. babbie, an environmental policy analyst with the new york public interest research group. on one side, assembly democrats have called for major changes that would tighten pollution standards and require impact studies in poor and minority communities where such plants would be placed, while on the other side, senate republicans want to renew the law as is. the two chambers passed their respective bills last year, then adjourned without resolving their differences. advertisement continue reading the main story the governor's bill, which he first proposed last year, lies somewhere between the assembly and senate positions

Article 4 - trump's presidential pen could remake supreme court's agenda - business insider
print washington (ap) — even before donald trump chooses a supreme court nominee, the new president can take steps to make several contentious court cases go away. legal challenges involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care and transgender rights all could be affected, without any help from congress. the cases turn on obama administration policies that rely on the president's pen, regulations or decisions made by federal agencies. and what one administration can do, the next can undo. it is not uncommon for the court's docket to change when one party replaces the other in the white house. that change in direction is magnified by the high-court seat trump will get to fill after senate republicans refused to consider president barack obama's nomination of judge merrick garland. ""we were hoping we'd be looking forward to a progressive majority on the supreme court. after the election results, there is a new reality,"" said elizabeth wydra, president of the liberal constitutional accountability center. the supreme court already is set to consider a case involving a transgender teen who was born female, but identifies as a male and wants to use the boys' bathroom at his virginia high school. when the federal appeals court in richmond ruled in student gavin grimm's favor this year, it relied on a determination by the u.s. education department that federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education also applies to gender identity. the new administration could withdraw the department's guidance, which could cause the justices to return

Article 5 - public role in species protection
one of the virtues of the endangered species act is its openness to citizen participation. the fish and wildlife service can designate likely species for federal protection. but ordinary citizens and nongovernmental organizations can petition to have candidates of their own choosing considered for protection. not everyone thinks this is a virtue. the enemies of the endangered species act are legion, especially in the house of representatives, and one of their major complaints has always been citizen petitions, which they claim are politically motivated and expensive, especially when they include litigation. an article in the current issue of science, confirms the value of citizens’ petitions. the article asks, who does a better job choosing species that are biologically threatened, the fish and wildlife service or public petitioners? the answer is surprising. species nominated by petition or litigation “face higher levels of biological threat than species identified by f.w.s.” they also tend to be species that are threatened by development. as the authors note, “species in conflict with development face greater biological threat levels” than other species. in short, the public path to species protection is at least as effective, and maybe more so, than the agency path. among the hundreds of species originally identified by the public as likely candidates for protection are the northern spotted owl, the coastal california gnatcatcher and the united states population of the canada lynx. their listing as endangered or threatened led to important habitat protections that would not otherwise have occurred. these impressive statistical results also help restate — and re-r

“i really did need a glass of water,” mr. obama said as he sipped the water that an aide handed to him. “this is not a stunt.” many here welcomed the president’s message, but his visit, months after the magnitude of the water crisis became apparent, also prompted expressions of exasperation from residents who are still struggling to confront the health and safety repercussions of drinking lead-tainted water for months. when he landed in flint on wednesday, the president was greeted with evident good will from people here, many of whom voted for him twice and consider themselves supporters. but mixed with the affection were misgivings. many flint residents say that the federal environmental protection agency shares the blame for failing to forcefully intervene early in the crisis, even after receiving complaints in 2014 that the water was foul and discolored. dozens of neighbors and demonstrators gathered across the street from the high school where mr. obama was scheduled to appear. some chanted in unison, “obama, obama, can’t you see, this flint water is killing me.” others waved bottles filled with brown water and wore t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan #flintlivesmatter. volunteers carried clipboards, busily soliciting signatures as part of a statewide effort to recall gov. rick snyder. in the seventh month since officials acknowledged the crisis, with unfiltered water still unsafe to drink, many remain angry with mr. snyder

to the editor: re ''kerry's special friends,'' by david brooks (column, feb. 7): do mr. brooks and other conservatives really want to open a discussion on special interest money in politics? many americans are awakening from their three-year slumber to discover the myriad and cynical ways that the bush administration has raided the american treasury to benefit its corporate contributors -- tax cuts, no-bid iraq contracts to halliburton, toxic-waste cleanup expenses borne by taxpayers, the ''healthy forests'' and ''clear skies'' initiatives, and the pending energy bill come to mind. special interest money in politics is endemic and polluting, and john kerry deserves scrutiny, even condemnation, for his behavior. nonetheless, republicans might remember that people in glass houses . . . robert e. bionaz evergreen park, ill., feb. 7, 2004

Title: congress’s spending bills
Content: to the editor: “appropriations trickery in congress” (editorial, may 2) highlights the importance of keeping ideological policy riders out of congressional spending bills. in addition to the attacks mentioned in the editorial, the budget has been a primary venue for republican leaders to undermine environmental protections. last year’s appropriations process included no fewer than 113 anti-environmental riders, attacking everything from clean air rules to endangered species protections to land preservation. this year, we have already seen a provision blocking the clean water rule, which protects drinking water for one in three americans. more riders are sure to come. whether they attack the environment or other public protections, ideological policy riders simply have no place in budget bills, which should be about dollars and cents. that is why we have joined with a diverse set of public interest groups like planned parenthood and americans for financial reform demanding that congress pass a clean budget free of ideological policy riders. that is the surest path for polluter allies in congress to end the gridlock and avoid a government shutdown over funding the government. gene karpinski president league of conservation voters washington

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss the impact of Republican-led efforts to weaken environmental regulations in the US. 

House Republicans have added anti-environmental provisions to a funding bill, which would roll back the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. The American Lung Association is urging Congress not to support these policies.

The Clean Air Act turns 40 this month, but its future is uncertain due to efforts by dirty energy proponents and climate change deniers to gut the law. 

House Republicans have unveiled a budget bill that includes provisions to block new environmental rules, including the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. The bill would also reduce EPA funding.

Chinese officials have reportedly given $350 million to a super PAC to sabotage Donald Trump's presidential bid and lobby for US-China trade deals.

The midterm election results indicate that Republicans will resist President Obama's agenda on energy and environment policy, potentially limiting regulations like those related to CO2 emissions. 

Carbon tax advocates are discussing post-election prospects, despite the fact that Republicans have historically opposed such a tax. However, some conservative leaders, including Grover Norquist, have expressed openness to a carbon tax if it is structured in a way that does not violate their pledge not to raise taxes.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has allocated millions of dollars for ""environmental justice"" programs, which aim to bring protection from health and environmental hazards to low-income communities.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Recent articles highlight various developments in US politics and policy. 

President Obama's State of the Union address emphasized affordable, high-quality child care as a national economic priority. His budget includes $200 billion for child care and early education over the next decade.

House Republicans are expected to vote on a proposal to water down the earmark ban, which was implemented in 2011 by former House Speaker John Boehner. The measure would allow lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a ""federal purpose.""

Governor George Pataki is seeking an extension of a state law governing the approval of new power plants, which expired on January 1. The law has divided state lawmakers, with Democrats calling for major changes and Republicans wanting to renew it as is.

President-elect Donald Trump's presidential pen could remake the Supreme Court's agenda by undoing policies implemented by his predecessor, Barack Obama. This includes cases involving immigration, climate change, cost-free contraceptive care, and transgender rights.

Citizen petitions have been shown to be effective in identifying species that are biologically threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Public petitions face higher levels of biological threat than those identified by the Fish and Wildlife Service.

President Obama visited Flint, Michigan, months after a water crisis became apparent, where residents are still struggling with health and safety repercussions from drinking lead-tainted water. The visit was met with both good will and misgivings from residents.

Article 1 - the democrat disconnect and the reign of the right
the democrat disconnect and the reign of the right (before it's news) i’ll admit it. i woke up on a wednesday morning in november 2016 in a world that i never thought was possible. trump winning the presidency is the single strangest political occurrence of my life. as a consultant, i figured it was time to hang up my business, because if i was this wrong about a guy like trump, i must not be any good at all at what i do. it wasn’t until i started looking at polling data, specifically data from the obama-to-trump flip states that i began to feel better about being that wrong (actually, i had accurately predicted the outcome of the election by two states the day before – flip nevada and wisconsin). how could those states that voted for obama in 2008 and 2012, flip by sometimes double digits to perhaps the most callused individual to ever run for president? the likeability factors between trump and obama were almost as divergent as the outcome of the 2012 and 2016 votes. certainly i was wrong, but it doesn’t get much more wrong than the dnc and the clinton campaign. in the days, weeks and months after the election, democrats, fueled by their denial and incredulity, sought to explain their loss on everything except the real problem that exists: their party is wildly disconnected from the american voter. it’s russia, stupid! imagine for

Article 2 - rand paul’s first senate win: “voters…wanted to give the finger to washington,” says the establishment gop candidate pau
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! trey grayson—the establishment-anointed candidate who rand paul trounced in kentucky’s 2010 gop senate primary—recently sat down with paul’s old campaign manager, david adams, to reminiscence about what the heck happened. the washington post has published the results. what’s the takeaway for libertarians? as adams says, “trey’s greatest strength was that he had mitch mcconnell in his corner. and rand’s greatest strength was that trey had mitch mcconnell in his corner. and it was a bigger strength for rand than it was for trey.” was this a sign that mcconnell just wasn’t serious enough as an across-the-board respecter of american liberties? not necessarily: donald trump won the state with over 62 percent of the vote on a scorched-earth nationalist platform that included promises to not cut entitlement spending, and then he appointed an attorney general, jeff sessions, who’s as opposed as anyone could be to paul on some of the senator’s pet issues, from surveillance to drug laws to criminal justice reform. (paul nonetheless voted to confirm sessions as attorney general. as adams says in the post piece, he’s trying to play along with others lately.) trump’s kentucky approval ratings have fallen by 20 percent lately. i’d like to think that’s because of appointments like sessions, but i doubt

Article 3 - rand paul is running for president (imo) and he isn’t his father
(before it's news) i just got off a reporter/phone call deal with sen. rand paul (r-kentucky), to discuss his foreign policy speech at heritage earlier today. some bullet-pointed comments he made: * “the elected officials here haven’t caught up with where the public is.” paul estimated that 70-80% of the public is broadly sympathetic to his more limited and humble conception of u.s. foreign policy, while “the reverse” is true both in the u.s. senate and the senate foreign relations committee, where he now sits. * “if any part of these ideas become part of a national campaign….” asked about his foreign policy’s appeal to democrats, paul singled out for praise sen. ron wyden (d-oregon), stressed that “libertarian republican ideas” may well have some sway among democrats, independents, and voters on the coasts, and volunteered the notion of a “national campaign.” * “i do want to be part of the national debate and the international debate.” asked about his presidential ambitions, paul did not say “i’m totally running,” but…he’s totally running. * “i think the interesting thing about kennan and containment is that it’s not a passive policy.” part of paul’s obvious third-way triangulation here (between “neoconservatism” and “isolationism,” as he put it in the speech) is to marry the complicated and non-conservative foreign policy

Article 4 - game over! paul ryan just got devastating news about his house speakership
paul ryan doesn’t understand that the flesh and bond people know what a globalist is. the politician can be democrat or republican and also be a globalist. he is the enemy within and has done his utmost to undermine the maga agenda. he hates trump so bad, that he doesn’t care what the people need!!! but the people can punish that! in the meanwhile, a new survey poll showed that paul ryan’s favorability rating is very low. this is why the leader of the nihilistic extremists in the house freedom caucus, led by mark meadows (r-nc), are already beginning to discuss who is the best person to replace ryan as speaker! their best option turned out to be, former trump chief strategist stephen k. bannon, who has now returned to helm the right-wing’s premier online hate rag. via the washington post: “several people close to bannon and meadows said on wednesday that the two men, who met on monday on capitol hill, have begun to discuss who could replace ryan as speaker, should conservatives rebel against him. but they stressed that those discussions remain speculative and informal, with no plan yet for action. meadows led the effort in 2015 to unseat then speaker john a. boehner (r-ohio). boehner stepped down months later.” maybe if he actually did something to help america rather than constantly spouting off about why he can’t, then maybe this

Article 5 - lessons from wednesday
lessons from wednesday (before it's news) i could spend all day posting links to articles about sen. rand paul’s filibuster, and the subsequent tantrums by mccain and lindsey. here are a couple that outline lessons to be learned. before i do, let me say that one of the major things that happened wednesday was that republicans, just a few republicans, showed how to command the media cycle for an entire day. and not just the new media. because of their conviction the main stream media was forced to cover it. and those who participated in the filibuster were thoughtful, focused, calm, and proactive, (not reactive). that lesson alone should be studied. here is jonathon moseley at american thinker: rand paul shifts political orbit rand paul unveiled a conservative answer to the left’s saul alinsky tactics: • rand paul shoved obama’s agenda off the public stage. just getting the political world talking about republicans’ message instead of obama’s means republicans are winning and obama is losing. • rand picked his issue very carefully. he chose the hill he wanted his opponent to die on. rand showed what happens when you wisely pick the right issue to defeat your opponent with. • yet rand’s issue seamlessly fit within his larger philosophy. he didn’t just take a cheap shot. rand chose an example that proves his larger point. as a caller to the chris plante show on washington’s wmal said, “

Article 6 - libertarians’ civil war over ukraine
libertarians’ civil war over ukraine headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! eric zuesse on the one hand, andrei illarionov of the koch brothers’ libertarian cato institute says that the first among “the crimes that have been committed or are being committed by the kremlin — stealing crimea” can be rectified only by rejecting “russia’s aggression in crimea,” which means to replace the current russian government by “a free democratic state with the rule of law”: i.e., overthrowing it in order to establish that very thing, “a free democratic state with the rule of law.” he says that, “the issue of crimea’s jurisdiction is within the competence of only one subject of international law — the owner of that territory, namely ukraine. only this subject, and no one else, has necessary legal rights to change this territory’s jurisdiction.” and, since ukraine did not sell crimea to russia, russia “stole” it from ukraine. he sees the issue of crimea as being not an issue of people, but of land: the land-area of crimea, which russia “stole” from ukraine — that russia stole the land and everything in it and under it and on it, including its residents. according to illarionov, crimea’s residents are simply human property there. they belong to ukraine, no matter what they think

Article 1 - obama bypasses senate process, filling 15 posts
“at a time of economic emergency, two top appointees to the department of treasury have been held up for nearly six months,” mr. obama said. “i simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government.” with lawmakers back in their home states and mr. obama spending a quiet family weekend at camp david, the white house issued the statement announcing the president’s intent to appoint mr. becker, and 14 others, mostly to fill positions on his economic and homeland security teams. the white house said the 15 nominees had been waiting, on average, seven months to be confirmed. they are expected to begin work over the next week; the president’s action will enable them to serve without senate confirmation until the chamber adjourns at the end of 2011. republicans, who have cast mr. becker as a pro-labor radical, issued a flurry of angry statements. they wasted little time in reminding reporters that when george w. bush was president, then-senator obama had railed against the recess appointment of john r. bolton as ambassador to the united nations, saying that mr. bolton would be “damaged goods” and lacked credibility without senate confirmation. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, called the president’s move “yet another episode of choosing a partisan path despite bipartisan opposition.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot

Article 2 - for republican leaders in congress, the headaches keep mounting
for republican leaders in congress, the headaches keep mounting image mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, and other republican leaders in congress are facing pressure from all sides of their party leading up to next year’s midterm elections. credit pete marovich for the new york times washington — republican leaders in congress are under attack from all sides of their own party, battered by voters from the right and left, spurned by frustrated donors and even threatened by the trump white house for ineffective leadership and insufficient loyalty. since last week, senate republicans lost one of their own when roy s. moore, the firebrand former state judge, trounced senator luther strange in a senate runoff in alabama. the retirement of senator bob corker of tennessee kicked off a potentially fratricidal fight for his seat, with the establishment’s preferred successor, gov. bill haslam, declining to run on thursday. an audiotape surfaced of vice president mike pence’s chief of staff, nick ayers, lambasting republican leaders and urging conservative donors to close their wallets to lawmakers who are disloyal to president trump. and a house republican, tim murphy of pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week after a text from his mistress became public in which she mocked him for trumpeting his staunch opposition to abortion as he pressured her to terminate a pregnancy. former representative michael grimm of new york has also resurfaced after serving time for felony tax fraud to challenge his republican

Article 3 - senate democratic leader urges bush to apologize over c.i.a. leak case
senator harry reid of nevada, the democratic leader, called sunday on president bush to apologize following the indictment of a senior white house official in the c.i.a. leak case, as democrats made clear they intended to keep pressure on the administration over the investigation. ''he should apologize, the vice president should apologize, they should come clean with the american public,'' mr. reid said on ''this week with george stephanopoulos on abc. he also said karl rove, the deputy white house chief of staff, should resign over his involvement in the case, even though he was not indicted along with i. lewis libby jr., the chief of staff to vice president dick cheney. senator christopher j. dodd, democrat of connecticut, called for further disclosure by the administration, focusing on mr. cheney and his role. the indictment against mr. libby alleges that mr. cheney was among those who provided information to mr. libby about valerie wilson's position as a c.i.a. officer. ''what did the vice president know?'' mr. dodd asked on ''fox news sunday.''

Article 4 - downturn in decibels, too
moments later mr. obama said, of rising oil prices and limited oil supplies, “there is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.” there were echoes — almost — of jimmy carter in that sentence. when was the last time a candidate vying for the highest office in the land summoned a memory of him rather than ronald reagan? to be sure, there were also the usual, classic, timeless paeans to american resourcefulness and optimism, along with the inevitable reagan reference — by mr. mccain. mr. obama noted that president john f. kennedy promised the moon — and the country indeed got there. mr. mccain said: “we can attack energy and health care at the same time. we’re not rifle shots here. we’re americans!” it was the oratorical equivalent of gov. sarah palin’s flag pin during the last debate, easily twice as big and twinkly as that of senator joseph r. biden jr. and there were a few moments during the long first hour — and a few more during the quick last half hour — when the exchanges were more spirited and tense. mr. mccain’s apparent irritation spiked as he exhibited condescension toward his younger rival. “by the way, my friends, i know you grow a little weary of this back and forth,” mr. mccain said, as he seized one of

Article 5 - boehner doubts immigration bill will pass in 2014
tea party activists have shifted their focus from cutting the federal budget deficit to thwarting what they call amnesty for those in the country illegally. conservative groups have called for a clean sweep of the republican leadership. one house member openly suggested that a drive now for comprehensive immigration legislation should cost mr. boehner his job. while reiterating his personal support for addressing the nation’s faltering laws to control the border, admit immigrants and workers, and handle the 11 million people in the country illegally, mr. boehner lamented, “i’ve never underestimated the difficulty in moving forward this year.” senator jeff sessions, republican of alabama, who organized opposition in the house toward the leadership’s immigration push, said mr. boehner’s comments were “a recognition of reality.” “obviously, the speaker had some goal to try to do something,” mr. sessions said, “but we were too far apart on substance to ever realistically expect an agreement with the democrats.” republican divisions are so deep, mr. sessions said, “it wouldn’t end well in any circumstance, so that was the only decision he could make.” senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina and a leading negotiator of the senate’s sweeping immigration legislation, blamed the toxic fallout from the fight over the affordable care act. mr. obama’s promises since his state of the union address to use his phone and his pen to wield executive power when congress will not act has soured

Article 6 - ex-governor says conviction was political
it was a small part of a voluminous justice department bribery-and-racketeering case, most of which — 25 out of 32 counts — was dismissed by the jury. nonetheless the government is urging a sentence of 30 years and is asking judge mark fuller of federal district court to even weigh charges on which mr. siegelman was acquitted. that incomplete government victory, in turn, loomed in the background of the arguments of mr. siegelman’s lawyers tuesday as they urged mr. fuller, an appointee of president bush, to go easy on their client, who was sitting in the dock with mr. scrushy. supporters, some wearing siegelman campaign buttons, packed the courtroom for the former governor, an alabama fixture whose career stretches back a quarter-century here, to the george wallace era. his start in politics came as george mcgovern’s alabama campaign manager in the 1972 presidential election. the shakiness of the federal case against mr. siegelman had forced prosecutors to “adopt the garbage-can theory of rico,” said g. robert blakey, a law professor at the university of notre dame and former prosecutor, referring to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act. professor blakey suggested that the charges against mr. siegelman had been indiscriminate from the outset. the government’s only limited success was very much on the mind of the former governor, once the brightest light in democratic politics

Article 7 - a nixon-era distraction steps out of limelight
bill kristol, editor of the weekly standard, said, ''lott is really virtually the last of the products of richard nixon's 'southern strategy' to be in major positions of power in the congress, and with his leaving, you will have cleared out people who, fairly or unfairly, have a somewhat compromised image to the country as a whole.'' but the past may not be so easy to leave behind, given race's enduring hold over politics, from the civil war and reconstruction to the civil rights revolution and affirmative-action debates of today. for all mr. bush's desire to broaden the republican appeal to black and hispanic voters and for all his personal rejections of prejudice, he and his father before him have used the symbolism of the past to political advantage. indeed, no sooner had mr. lott stepped down, sped by mr. bush's stern condemnation, than the president's spokesman, ari fleischer, found himself faced with renewed questions from reporters about whether mr. bush regretted his visit in 2000 to bob jones university, which then banned interracial dating. by midday, democrats were circulating questions about the civil rights records of mr. lott's all-but-certain successor, senator bill frist of tennessee, and the new chairman of the party's senate campaign committee, george f. allen of virginia, including mr. allen's acknowledgment that he once had the confederate battle flag in his living room. mr

mr. mcconnell said last week that while he respects the intelligence agencies’ conclusions, the senate intelligence committee is “more than capable of conducting a complete review” itself. he also acknowledged that mr. mccain could conduct an investigation on the armed services committee, an option that remains open should mr. mcconnell decide against a select committee. those divisions, coming as the electoral college prepares to meet on monday to ratify mr. trump’s election and the president-elect completes his cabinet choices, all but ensured that the issue would cloud the first months of mr. trump’s presidency, when he will be asking congress to approve an aggressive legislative agenda. several permanent congressional committees have already been tasked with examining various aspects of the russian interference, which has been largely accepted as fact by most members of congress. but in their letter on sunday, the lawmakers argued the issue was too important and complicated for an existing committee to take on properly. “we share your respect for, and deference to, the regular order of the senate, and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request,” the senators wrote to mr. mcconnell. “however, we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem.” in addition to undertaking a “comprehensive investigation of russian interference,” the senators recommended that such a committee also develop “comprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation’s laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge.” select committees,

Title: parliamentarian in role as health bill referee
Content: “he’s basically the defense, the prosecution, the judge, the jury and the hangman in this scenario,” said senator judd gregg of new hampshire, the senior republican on the budget committee, whose staff has been meeting with mr. frumin on reconciliation matters for months. “it all comes down to him.” that makes some republicans uncomfortable. mr. gregg calls mr. frumin “a very fair and straightforward guy in a very difficult job.” but in a sign of how acrimonious the debate has become, others in the minority party have been insinuating that mr. frumin is in the democrats’ pocket — remarks that amount to a kind of washington version of working the referee before the big game. the rumblings began in december when mr. frumin sided with democrats as republicans tried to delay a health care vote. senator jim demint, republican of south carolina, said in comments published in the capitol hill newspaper roll call that mr. frumin was “clearly biased” — a remark that was apparently too blunt for some of his colleagues, judging by the apology mr. demint later delivered on the senate floor. now, with the white house pushing congress to act on health care by easter, the warnings and caveats about mr. frumin are flying once again. “i think he’s an honest man, but we’ll see,” said senator orrin g. hatch, republican of utah. “some people buckle under pressure. he would lose tremendous prestige if he buckles under pressure.” photo asked if he had evidence of partisan leanings by mr. frumin, mr. hatch shrugged. “i’m sure he’s a democrat,” the senator said, “but i think he’s an honest man.” in fact, mr. frumin, 63, is a registered independent, voting records show. parliamentarians are appointed by the party in power; mr. frumin, who joined the office as an assistant in 1977, is the only parliamentarian to have been installed in the top job by both democrats and republicans. democrats put him there in 1987 when senator robert c. byrd was majority leader; in 2001, he was reinstalled under trent lott, a republican. advertisement continue reading the main story the parliamentarian’s job requires years of apprenticeship, and the work is so obscure that few people in washington can do it. for much of his career, mr. frumin has alternated with robert dove, who learned the hard way what can happen to a parliamentarian who irks a senate leader. he was fired by mr. lott after advising republicans that they could not add a $5 billion emergency allocation to the budget. that mr. dove called it “a slush fund” probably did not help. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the

Article 2 - movie review -- <em>spider-man: homecoming</em>
(before it's news) another bleedin’ spider-man movie, you say? homecoming is the second attempt in five years to reboot this wobbly franchise—and it might do the trick. for one thing, thanks to some desperate corporate deal-making, spidey is now officially a part of the marvel cinematic universe, which enables cross-promotional high-fives by fellow avengers iron man and captain america. most important, there’s been a fresh character re-think by indie director jon watts (cop car), who’s also one of the movie’s many writers. watts’s peter parker—the larval spider-man—is basically just a kid, a 15-year-old high school student with an impossible crush on a beautiful senior and an impossible dream of taking her to the big homecoming dance. the movie is essentially a teen coming-of-age story (think john hughes, clueless, can’t hardly wait) cranked up with a blast of spidery superpowers. watts was wise in casting tom holland to play this new spider-man. holland (the lost city of z) was 20 years old when the movie was shot, younger than tobey maguire and andrew garfield, his immediate predecessors in the role. as a former stage and tv dancer, he brings an irresistible athletic energy to the proceedings. the movie does all of us a favor by ditching the traditional spider-man origin story. we know about uncle ben. we know about the radioactive spider bite

Article 1 - taking stock of the gay-rights revolution
tom (the lawyer): i hate classifying everything that way. ''gay play.'' what's a ''straight play''? michael (the teacher): mamet. charles: you see? that's exactly the kind of joke that would be in the play about us. this exchange, which couldn't be more accurate in its synopsis, is typical of mr. tolins's shrewd humor. throughout this smart, timely and funny play, the self-awareness of the characters is eclipsed only by that of the playwright, whose intention here is clearly to express impatience with the staler elements of gay dramatic literature and to push the ''gay'' play forward into its next generation of concerns. the subject of ''the last sunday in june'' -- so named for the date of the annual gay pride parade, which is going on outside the window -- is the function of the ''gay community,'' however that might be defined, at a time when the idea of gay rights is no longer revolutionary. tom (peter smith) and michael (johnathan f. mcclain) are on the verge of moving to the suburbs, i.e., out of their gay-centric neighborhood and into the land of straight people. and the questions that underlie the gathering are about things like whether gay men are better off among themselves or living in the wider world, whether defining oneself by one's sexual orientation is healthy and fulfilling and whether the gains for homosexuals in the last three decades have turned gay

Article 3 - first came the sitcom. then came the murder. then came the pornographic web site. now here comes the holly wood biopic!
carpenter, played by willem dafoe in ''auto focus,'' met crane on the set of ''hogan's heroes.'' he worked for sony, instructing wealthy customers on how to operate home-video equipment -- a technology then in its infancy. carpenter (who is not john carpenter the horror-film director) set up systems for elvis presley and alfred hitchcock before selling equipment to crane. the two men subsequently became friends, united in their pursuit of women in bars, through singles' ads and at swing parties. ''a day without sex,'' crane liked to say, ''is a day wasted.'' many of these encounters were captured on video. crane's celebrity helped score the girls; carpenter typically played cinematographer. the friendship ran aground, however, when crane's second marriage collapsed and he could no longer find work. (hollywood had learned of his secret.) blaming his relationship with carpenter for his problems, crane severed contact. this break upset carpenter, who had become emotionally dependent -- and perhaps sexually fixated -- on his famous friend. that conjecture is central to ''auto focus''; schrader frames the symbiotic relationship of carpenter and crane as a story of unrequited love. indeed, when crane was found dead in scottsdale, ariz., carpenter was the main suspect. he was later acquitted, because of a lack of evidence, and died in 1998.

Article 4 - 'the holy land'
directed by eitan gorlin not rated, 96 minutes in following the odyssey of a shy ultra-orthodox jewish student who suspends his rabbinical studies to flail around in israel's secular fleshpots, eitan gorlin's ambitious but muddled film ''the holy land'' is a contemporary variation on the parable of the prodigal son. churning hormones have everything to do with the decision by nerdy, bumbling mendy (oren rehany) to take a sabbatical from school after his teacher catches him reading herman hesse in class and suggests he scratch his itch with a secret, one-time visit to a prostitute. mendy heeds this advice and is left pathetically besotted after a five-second sexual encounter with sasha (tchelet semel), a 19-year-old russian prostitute he meets at a topless bar in tel aviv. outside the club mendy is importuned by mike (saul stein), a rugged american-born war photographer and friend of sasha who invites him to visit the bar he owns in jerusalem. convincing his parents that a sojourn in the holy city might rekindle the spark of his faith, mendy moves to jerusalem, where he ends up working as a bartender at mike's saloon, a melting pot (that bears some resemblance to rick's gin joint in ''casablanca'') where jews and arabs carouse

''originally i had pictured her part as much darker, more of a jane eyre kind of role, but allison came in and put a different spin on it that i thought was marvelous,'' said erc stoltz, the movie's director.

Article 6 - fantasies without bounds for a lothario with limits
crispin hellion glover’s planned trilogy of blatant weirdness continues with a second installment, “it is fine! everything is fine.” like last year’s part 1, “what is it?,” this follow-up (with david brothers as co-director) will attract only the most adventurous filmgoers, who will have to wade through some rather repugnant material to weigh the movie’s merits. steven c. stewart, who appeared briefly in “what is it?” ensconced in a supersize seashell while being sexually stimulated by a woman’s hand, is now, as screenwriter and star, the master of his own pornographic fantasy world, which stems from his frustrations with being disabled. (mr. stewart, who had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair, died before the film’s completion.) he portrays himself as a serial lady-killer whose long-tressed victims not only understand clearly what he says (a luxury audiences won’t share) but also readily sleep with him, unaware that he will strangle them afterward. photo alternately sweet and devilish, mr. stewart moves us to pity and revulsion, in essence recreating feelings similar to those that might be experienced by someone faced with a disabled person in reality. ever the tireless, traveling showman, mr. glover will again be on hand before each screening to present his hourlong “big slide show,” which, like his films, is wildly impassioned

Article 7 - 'smell of camphor, fragrance of jasmine'
directed by bahman farmanara not rated, 93 minutes bahman farmanara's ''smell of camphor, fragrance of jasmine'' has a pixilated charm and, under the surface, a current of despair. mr. farmanara's sense of humor flows into this three-part story about bahman, a filmmaker coming to terms with his own mortality; he could be an iranian woody allen using his own life for scoring laughs off himself. ''your call is a good thing for a bad day,'' the depressed bahman says to his son, who has called him, in the section of the film called ''a bad day.'' this melancholy lump of a man clutches his left arm in pain, often as he's reaching for a cigarette. his current job isn't generating many thrills for him either; he's making a documentary on iranian burial rituals for japanese television. ''they pay well,'' he says to his son. he understands that he has to keep working, though.

it was so intense that no one bought it, so for years he supported his family by doing pickup work in construction and photography that sometimes brought him into los angeles film studios. hollywood and the mechanics of film fantasy are a primary source of his art. this is particularly true of the recent works that tend to be big-budget projects, now that the market has finally discovered him. the armory installation, his biggest so far, is a compendium of signature ingredients: violence, humor, sex, impotence, appetite, degradation, art history, politics and pop culture. the piece is based on two intersecting elements: the 1937 disney animated film “snow white and the seven dwarfs” and the suburban home of mr. mccarthy’s childhood. but like the installation’s title — “ws” stands for white snow — everything is in a disordered version of an original form. on an islandlike platform in the center of the armory, mr. mccarthy has constructed a three-quarters-scale facsimile of the facade of his childhood ranch house in utah and set it, inaccessibly, in a kind of dank rain forest of plastic trees and fake flowers. the rest of the house is set up outside the forest and is approachable, with cutaway walls and windows. but while its rooms are precise in their period décor, they are strewn with refuse, splattered with dark fluids and unoccupied except for the nude bodies of a

Title: drug-fueled rants from a ’50s film
Content: photo let’s get this right out of the way: the full title of daniel fish’s new work is “tom ryan thinks he’s james mason starring in a movie by nicholas ray in which a man’s illness provides an escape from the pain, pressure and loneliness of trying to be the ultimate american father, only to drive him further into the more thrilling though possibly lonelier roles of addict and misunderstood visionary.” sounds kind of like fun, doesn’t it? and you’d think a 53-word title might say it all, right? well, it isn’t always, and it doesn’t, quite. the play, a clever two-person distillation of nicholas ray’s 1956 movie “bigger than life,” pays deserving tribute to a cinematic act of provocation. ray’s film, while a commercial failure, was a bold grenade lobbed at the pieties of the 1950s. the play only faintly enriches the story, despite the actors’ vigorous efforts and the script’s flashes of absurdist wit. in the film james mason plays ed avery, an underpaid suburban schoolteacher who assumes a second job unbeknownst to his wife, lou (barbara rush), only to learn he has blood ailment requiring cortisone pills — steroids. soon he’s secretly addicted to them, and they play havoc on his sanity, at great cost to his work, lou and his young son, richie. ed’s drug-induced hyperactive rants allow ray to express heresies of the period (slamming the education system, religion, the banalities of suburban life) while parodying its values. (ed sadistically drives richie to “be a man” and perfect his football skills.) meanwhile the drugs provide the director a convenient out: a chemical cause for ed’s feverish dissent. in mr. fish’s 65-minute rendition — part of incubator arts’ other forces festival — the words flow briskly as all the roles alternate between thomas jay ryan (he of the start of the title) and christina rouner, occupying a bare stage. mr. ryan plays ed more often than ms. rouner, who often plays lou and richie. there is humor (mr. ryan praises thunderbird wine as if he were in a tv commercial on auto-repeat; an inflatable miller lite blimp stands in for the football), and there are limp attempts at redressing the lot of richie and lou, the butts of nasty verbal abuse in the film and even louder — very loud, at close proximity — abuse onstage. ms. rouner bravely tries, as ms. rush did, to convey dignity. but she is vastly eclipsed by mr. ryan and by mr. fish’s direction. mr. ryan, who persuasively portrayed the gay activist harry hay in “the temperamentals” last year, offers fleeting notes of

Article 1 - china and india file rival claims over tibetan medicine
recognition could be beneficial, they said, if it led to greater access to medical care for rural tibetans, recruitment of more tibetan medical practitioners for high-level advisory roles or laws to regulate the production of pharmaceuticals. the worry, however, is that unesco recognition could lift the industry’s commercial development without addressing some of its underlying problems, such as the watering-down of traditional medicinal formulas and the over-harvesting of medicinal ingredients in the wild. the founding text of tibetan medicine is “for the whole world to enjoy,” said tashi tsering phuri, the director of the tibetan medical and astro-science institute in dharamsala, the indian city that serves as the seat of the tibetan government in exile and the residence of the dalai lama. “it should not be a bone of contention between two big nations.” sowa rigpa is practiced in china, india and neighboring countries including bhutan, mongolia and nepal. the name is often translated into english as “the science of healing,” and the present form of the discipline’s founding text, “the four tantras,” is attributed by many western scholars to a 12th-century tibetan physician, with antecedents stretching to the eighth century or earlier. photo as late as the early 1990s, there was no discernible competition between china and india to claim tibetan medicine as cultural pat

yoga has encountered such objections before — conservative christian parents in new york and california have branded its use in schools as religious indoctrination. since 2004, islamic clerics have issued fatwas prohibiting yoga for muslims in egypt, malaysia and indonesia. the question of whether there is any justification to such opposition is a delicate one. certainly, yoga’s evolution has been inextricably linked with that of hinduism. the word itself, linguistically related to “yoke,” first appears in the rig veda, a sacred hindu text from around the 15th century b.c., to describe a chariot yoked to horses, in which a felled war hero might ascend to the sun. as the tradition of meditation and exercise developed among indian ascetics between a.d. 200 and 400, “yoga” acquired its new meaning of reining in body and mind to rise above worldly concerns. in this sense, yoga undeniably embodies the worldview of hinduism (as well as buddhism and jainism), in which the goal is to end suffering through enlightenment. advertisement continue reading the main story however, there is no historical record of other religions’ disapproving of yoga. muslim travelers in india, fascinated by yoga’s teachings, started bringing translated works to the islamic world almost a millennium ago. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address.

Article 6 - religion journal; yoga in aspen public schools draws opposition
opposition was initially directed at the curriculum -- prepared by two yoga practitioners from los angeles, where the curriculum is also used in some schools -- which has since been altered to eliminate any language that might be construed as religious. a lawyer for the public school advised that the revised curriculum did not violate the constitution. leah kalish, an author of the curriculum being used in aspen, said opponents took issue with any sanskrit words. one was ''namaste,'' a word that she said was used in yoga classes to say, ''the light in you is the light in me,'' or more generally, ''to acknowledge our common humanity.'' the students end class here by saying ''peace'' rather than ''namaste.'' at the private school, there was little resistance from parents over yoga classes. but yoga classes for sixth through ninth grade were canceled because of lack of interest. yoga is taught in schools from california to florida to ohio and has raised eyebrows and ire before. in a lawsuit that was settled by an appeals court in 2001, parents sued the bedford central school district in westchester county, n.y., in part because a sikh minister taught yoga at a high school. the case began in 1996, and the school district prevailed once the federal appeals court vacated many of the charges. here at aspen elementary school, with children being children, their yoga instructor spends a great deal of the 25-minute class time simply reminding them to stop talking and be quiet

Article 7 - namaste
photo ‘at the beginning of class, we stood at the front of our mats and let out a long, dirgelike moan,” the first-time yoga student recollected. “then the teacher yelled, ‘chili-pepper pasta,’ and everyone hit the floor.” sanskrit, the language of yoga, is said to unite sound and meaning; that is, saying the word gives the experience of its meaning. but for the novice yogi (the word for male as well as female practitioners), whose ears need to be tuned to a new frequency, that experience can be as elusive as an overnight parking spot in manhattan. thus, chaturanga dandasana (four-legged staff pose, which looks like the bottom of a pushup, your body hovering inches above the floor) might become “chili-pepper pasta” if you’ve got dinner reservations at the latest outpost of the latest fusion craze. and the ear-twisters don’t end there. so let’s do some untwisting. first off, that “moan” at the beginning of class was the mantra om. it’s the vibration that existed at the birth of the universe and is all-pervading still and is chanted as a reminder of the interconnectedness of all life — human, animal, plant, insect, mineral, etc. a mantra is a word or phrase that protects the mind. from what? well, from itself, because a mind has . . . a mind of its

There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made in the article are supported by the information provided.","The articles discuss various issues related to the Middle East conflict, including American hypocrisy on chemical weapons, Palestinian youth groups protesting US President Barack Obama's visit, and the denial of a cash prize to an Arab author who visited Israel.

A report by AP found that Syrians in Ghouta accused Saudi-supplied rebels of being behind the chemical attack. Meanwhile, Palestinians for Dignity Group called for rejecting Obama's visit and demonstrating against resuming negotiations with Israel.

An award-winning Arab author, Boualem Sansal, was denied a cash prize after attending the Jerusalem Writers Festival in Israel. The Arab Ambassadors Council withheld the prize due to Sansal's association with Jews.

In another development, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accepted a three-year transition period during peace negotiations with Israel. He stated that this would allow for gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.

The European Union (EU) released new guidelines on Israel, stating that settlements are illegal under international law and that future agreements will include a ""territorial clause"" requiring Israel to acknowledge the Palestinian territories as separate from its own territory.

A poll found that only 24% of Israelis support the amended Arab Peace Initiative, which proposes recognition and normalization with Israel after an independent Palestinian state is established. 

Israel warned of ""harsh"" consequences for Palestinians if they proceed with their UN bid, while a peace index survey showed that Israeli Arabs and Jews have different views on President Obama's visit.

These articles highlight the complexities and challenges in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including issues of chemical weapons, US policy, and the role of international organizations like the EU.","Recent articles discuss the Middle East peace process and its challenges. 

In one article, a former Israeli official praises the US and Israel's decision to support Hamas extremists, citing it as a ""bad choice"" that radicalized the population and undermined moderates. However, this approach has reinforced hard-liners in Israel, Palestine, and America.

Another article profiles a Swiss diplomat who attempted to bring together Israeli and Palestinian freelancers on Swiss soil after the Clinton peace initiative fell apart. The diplomat's idea was met with skepticism but showed hope for civility in the region.

A senior Palestinian official declares broad agreement on a long-term cease-fire with Israel, which would effectively be a declaration of a halt to armed conflict. However, Israeli officials caution that intent is not deed and that a mutual declaration or treaty is unlikely.

The US and UN back measures to halt war in Lebanon, including expanding the UN peacekeeping force and banning arms sales to Lebanon except as authorized by its government.

US President Trump announces plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, alarming Middle East leaders. This move could disrupt the peace process and unleash a new wave of violence across the region.

Former US President Obama seeks to pave the way for a Middle East deal after leaving office, aiming to show a way to resolve central issues dividing the two sides. However, his efforts have been hindered by deadlock on final-status issues between Israel and Palestine.

In another article, Israeli officials express concern over Trump's threat to cut Palestinian aid, which they see as blackmailing the Palestinians.

palestinian authority accepts a three year transition period during peace negotiations (before it's news) in one of his major concessions in this round of the peace process initiated in july, palestinian president mahmoud abbas said tuesday he would accept an israeli military presence in a future sovereign and independent state, for a period of three years. “whoever proposes a transition period of 10 or 15 years does not really want to retreat,” abbas said in an interview played tuesday at a security conference. he referenced proposals by israeli ministers who support the creation of a palestinian state, but who estimate a transition period to be of 10 and 40 years. “a transition period may not exceed three years, during which israel would withdraw gradually,” abbas said in the interview, conducted in arabic. the interview was conceded at the institute for national security studies and was aired by the palestinian news agency maan. “we are also willing to have a third party take place during and after israel ‘s withdrawal to allay concerns and provide assurances to both sides that things will proceed normally,” he added. israel, however, has rejected negotiations in the presence of an international force such as the united nations or nato on palestinian soil. both parties have until april 29 to negotiate and reach an agreement, at the request of the secretary of state, john kerry. on tuesday a palestinian delegation met with kerry in

the two-state solution: achieving majority support among israelis and palestinians (before it's news) credit: xandernieuws.punt.nl in july, i wrote a blog post that commented on a couple of polls that had recently been conducted which seemed to contradict themselves. one poll, commissioned by the israel peace initiative and conducted by the israeli company new wave research, had found that a majority of israelis support the amended arab peace initiative (api), which proposes that all arab states grant israel full recognition and normalization of relations after the establishment of an independent palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with swaps and a just and agreed upon solution to the palestinian refugee problem is reached. the original api had called for a complete israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines, which had never acquired majority support in israel. the other poll, conducted jointly by the hebrew university and the palestinian center for policy and survey research (psr) had found that a majority of palestinians also support the amended api. at first glance, the amended api seemed to be the common ground on which a majority of israelis and palestinians could stand. yet there was one problem: the poll conducted jointly by the hebrew university and psr (the “joint poll”) also found that only 24 percent of israelis support the amended api, almost a 10% decrease from the level of support before the

Article 1 - strengthening extremists
now when he hears of extremists firing rockets at southern israeli towns like sderot, mr. sharif has a warm feeling all over. when hamas won democratic elections in gaza and then seized full power a year ago, there were no good choices for israel and america. hamas includes terrorists, islamic fundamentalists and ideologues, and it has cultivated ties with iran. it has decent governance by the region’s devalued standards — it is not particularly corrupt; it delivers social services efficiently, and the streets are safe — but it runs a police state and alarms all its neighbors. of all the bad choices, israel chose perhaps the worst. punishing everyone in gaza radicalized the population, cast hamas as a victim, gave its officials an excuse for economic failures and undermined the moderates who are the best hope of both israel and the arab world. if the u.s. and israel had formed a joint commission to support hamas extremists and bolster iranian influence, they could hardly have done a better job. the episode is the latest evidence that hard-liners in israel, palestine and america all reinforce each other. arab terrorism led to the rise of israeli hawks and to two invasions of lebanon. the first israeli invasion helped give birth to hezbollah, and then the israeli assaults on palestinian police helped nurture hamas. so while israelis denounce hezbollah and

Article 3 - hope, skepticism and fear: back on the road to civility
at the summit meeting on tuesday, mr. abbas is expected to declare broad palestinian agreement on a long-term cease-fire with the israelis. a senior palestinian official says mr. abbas may even declare ""a cessation of armed conflict,"" which would effectively be a declaration of a halt to the armed intifada after the deaths of more than 1,000 israelis and 3,000 palestinians. such a declaration would itself be a bold step for the cautious mr. abbas, who has barely begun to solidify his hold on real power. but senior israeli officials caution that intent is not deed. to declare a halt to violence, they say, does not mean an actual halt, which can only be proved over time. so they say that mr. sharon, for his part, is willing to announce that if the palestinians hold to a cease-fire and then move to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism, israel will refrain from military activity. ""in other words,"" a senior israeli military official said, ""we just defend ourselves. if the palestinians say they're committed to ending the violence, then we would be committed not to act militarily."" but there will be no mutual declaration or anything that has the force of a treaty, israeli officials insist. instead, this meeting and the statements made there will represent the hopes and aspirations of both leaders -- hopes and aspirations that will be tested over time,

Article 4 - palestinian opposes provisional state
none of the parties to the talks here predicted any speedy breakthrough. although no formal proposal has been presented, some israeli officials have floated the idea that the peace process could be accelerated by establishing a provisional palestinian state within temporary borders to be subsequently set. but mr. abbas said the idea would never work, fearing that the palestinians might be locked into an inferior map. “we have also noted to minister rice our decision to end any temporary or transitional solutions including a state with temporary borders because we do not believe it to be a realistic choice that can be built upon,” mr. abbas said during a joint news conference with the secretary of state. mr. abbas also issued assurances that there would be careful spending and accounting of american money should congress approve a state department proposal for $86 million in “non-lethal assistance” to enhance those branches of the palestinian security forces directly under his political wing — as opposed to those loyal to hamas. “be confident that we will not misuse any aid that we receive from any party,” he said, noting that vehicles and communications equipment, as well as weapons, had been destroyed in clashes with the israelis. late sunday night, israeli troops shot two palestinians, detonating the explosives they were carrying as they approached the gaza strip’s border fence with israel, the israeli military said. both palestinians were killed, the military added. the rice-abbas meeting was held in

Article 5 - u.n. council backs measure to halt war in lebanon
the security council resolution, drafted by france and the united states, expands the existing 2,000-member united nations peacekeeping force, known as unifil, to 15,000 and dispatches it into southern lebanon to assist a 15,000-member lebanese force that fouad siniora, lebanon’s prime minister, has pledged to send there. in addition, the resolution gives unifil, a peace-monitoring force that has long been criticized as ineffective and lacking resources, greatly enhanced authority, equipment, responsibilities and scope of operation. the resolution calls for a ban on all sales or other supply of arms to lebanon, except as authorized by its government. israel has interpreted this as preventing hezbollah from being resupplied with weapons by syria and iran. photo the measure also calls for the disarmament of all armed groups in lebanon, a reference to hezbollah, but it does not specify how this should be done. the language of the resolution calls for an immediate cessation of “all attacks” by hezbollah but only of “all offensive military operations” by israel. the resolution does not define “offensive military action,” but both american and israeli officials said that israel would be able to address threats to citizens in israel and its armed forces in lebanon, and that it could respond to attacks from hezbollah. if faced with an imminent threat, a senior american official said, “

Article 6 - u.s. to recognize jerusalem as israel’s capital, trump says, alarming middle east leaders
mr. trump spent tuesday morning explaining the policy change in telephone calls with prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel; mahmoud abbas, the palestinian authority president; and to arab leaders who warned him that it would disrupt the peace process, perhaps fatally, and could unleash a new wave of violence across the region. “moving the u.s. embassy is a dangerous step that provokes the feelings of muslims around the world,” king salman of saudi arabia told mr. trump in their call, according to saudi state television. late on tuesday, palestinian national and islamic groups issued a joint statement calling for three days of “popular anger” to protest mr. trump’s move, beginning on wednesday throughout the palestinian territories and in demonstrations at united states embassies and consulates around the world. fearing attacks, the american consulate in jerusalem barred employees and family members from going to the old city or the west bank, while the state department urged embassies around the world to tighten their security. jerusalem is one of the world’s most fiercely contested swaths of real estate, with both sides disputing each other’s claims. west jerusalem is the seat of israel’s government, but the palestinians view east jerusalem as the capital of a future palestinian state, and most of the world considers it occupied territory. jerusalem’s old city has the third-holiest mosque in islam and the holiest site

Article 7 - obama seeks to pave way to mideast deal after he leaves office
an even deeper potential source of friction between the leaders, officials said, stems from the possibility that mr. obama will make a last foray into peacemaking. in whatever form that would take, the purpose would be to show a way of resolving all the central issues that divide the two sides, from the borders of a palestinian state to israel’s security and the political status of jerusalem. “obama and kerry are looking at the very real likelihood that the two-state solution could die on their watch,” said martin s. indyk, who served as the special envoy for israel-palestinian peace negotiations under mr. kerry in 2013 and 2014. “having tried everything else, i think they feel a responsibility, above all to israel’s future as a jewish and democratic state, to preserve the principles of a two-state solution.” after months of intensive talks, mr. kerry failed to break a deadlock on the so-called final-status issues between mr. netanyahu and the president of the palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas. mr. netanyahu has since won re-election with a government that is even more hard-line on these issues than his last one. during that campaign, the prime minister disavowed his support for the two-state solution. mr. abbas’s position, meanwhile, has been eroded by months of violent attacks by palestinians on israeli jews. adding to the urgency of the

Article 8 - trump’s threat to cut palestinian aid worries many in israel
“we will not be blackmailed,” hanan ashrawi, a senior palestinian official, said in a statement on wednesday. “president trump has sabotaged our search for peace, freedom and justice. now he dares to blame the palestinians for the consequences of his own irresponsible actions!” nabil abu rudeineh, a spokesman for mahmoud abbas, the president of the palestinian authority, was also angry. “jerusalem and its holy places are not for sale,’’ he said, “not with gold nor with silver.” for israelis, too, mr. trump’s tweets presented a problem and, inscrutable as a talmudic text in parts, were left open to some feverish interpretation. mr. trump was unclear about what funding he would cut and said that his administration had “taken jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table.” the statement appeared to contradict his own assurances, and those of other american officials, that the boundaries of israeli sovereignty within jerusalem were still up for discussion. he also said that the israelis “would have had to pay more” for the recognition of their capital, suggesting that the country would have had to reciprocate with significant concessions to the palestinians. the relationship between israel and the united nations relief and works agency is complicated. israel has accused the agency of perpetuating the palestinian refugee problem, while at the same time

Content: despite her concerns, she said she was impressed at the depth and seriousness of the negotiations. she also addressed the growing skepticism of the chances of success. “i can’t say yes, absolutely, they will get an agreement,” ms. rice said. “no one can say that. but the idea that they have no chance of getting an agreement by the end of the year, i just think is not right.” on the palestinian winners of the fulbright award, the american government’s flagship international education study grant, israel permitted four students to exit gaza, but told three others that they were security risks and could not enter israel in order to fly to the united states. the israelis declined to give details of their concerns to the students or to journalists, but they did say they were sharing them with american officials. “it continues to be my belief that all of the fulbrights should be able to take up their fellowships,” ms. rice said. “i consider this to be a very high priority to get this resolved.” maj. peter lerner, spokesman for the section of israel’s defense ministry that handles palestinian civilian affairs, said shin bet, the internal security service, had determined that the three students were sufficient risks that they could not leave gaza and enter israel. israel’s policy toward gaza is to bar all but emergency humanitarian movement in and out to pressure hamas, the governing party. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. but the american government had vetted all of the fulbright winners for security as well as for academic achievement. ms. rice said that unless there was something significant she did not know about the three men that the israelis could present to her, she wanted them to be permitted to leave. the three — zuhair abu shaaban, 24, osama dawoud, 25, and fidaa abed, 23 — studied at the islamic university of gaza, a hamas stronghold, which is perhaps the reason israel has concerns about them. but all said in interviews on sunday that they had studied there because it was the only institution in gaza that offered the engineering fields they wanted to pursue and that they had never been involved in hamas or politics of any kind. “i don’t support hamas,” mr. dawoud said. he is hoping to be able to accept the offer to study for a doctorate in environmental engineering at the university of utah. mr. abu shaaban, who has been accepted into a master’s program in electrical engineering at the university

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various issues related to the Middle East conflict, including American hypocrisy on chemical weapons, Palestinian youth groups protesting US President Barack Obama's visit, and the denial of a cash prize to an Arab author who visited Israel.

A report by AP found that Syrians in Ghouta accused Saudi-supplied rebels of being behind the chemical attack. Meanwhile, Palestinians for Dignity Group called for rejecting Obama's visit and demonstrating against resuming negotiations with Israel.

An award-winning Arab author, Boualem Sansal, was denied a cash prize after attending the Jerusalem Writers Festival in Israel. The Arab Ambassadors Council withheld the prize due to Sansal's association with Jews.

In another development, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accepted a three-year transition period during peace negotiations with Israel. He stated that this would allow for gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.

The European Union (EU) released new guidelines on Israel, stating that settlements are illegal under international law and that future agreements will include a ""territorial clause"" requiring Israel to acknowledge the Palestinian territories as separate from its own territory.

A poll found that only 24% of Israelis support the amended Arab Peace Initiative, which proposes recognition and normalization with Israel after an independent Palestinian state is established. 

Israel warned of ""harsh"" consequences for Palestinians if they proceed with their UN bid, while a peace index survey showed that Israeli Arabs and Jews have different views on President Obama's visit.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Recent articles discuss the Middle East peace process and its challenges. 

In one article, a former Israeli official praises the US and Israel's decision to support Hamas extremists, citing it as a ""bad choice"" that radicalized the population and undermined moderates. However, this approach has reinforced hard-liners in Israel, Palestine, and America.

Another article profiles a Swiss diplomat who attempted to bring together Israeli and Palestinian freelancers on Swiss soil after the Clinton peace initiative fell apart. The diplomat's idea was met with skepticism but showed hope for civility in the region.

A senior Palestinian official declares broad agreement on a long-term cease-fire with Israel, which would effectively be a declaration of a halt to armed conflict. However, Israeli officials caution that intent is not deed and that a mutual declaration or treaty is unlikely.

The US and UN back measures to halt war in Lebanon, including expanding the UN peacekeeping force and banning arms sales to Lebanon except as authorized by its government.

US President Trump announces plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, alarming Middle East leaders. This move could disrupt the peace process and unleash a new wave of violence across the region.

Former US President Obama seeks to pave the way for a Middle East deal after leaving office, aiming to show a way to resolve central issues dividing the two sides. However, his efforts have been hindered by deadlock on final-status issues between Israel and Palestine.

In another article, Israeli officials express concern over Trump's threat to cut Palestinian aid, which they

Article 2 - the economy: “anarchy from above”
(before it's news) “anarchy from above” by brian maher “g.k. chesterton once warned about “anarchy from above.” think of anarchy and its mobs and molotov cocktails. but as chesterton wrote, “it isn’t necessary that anarchy should be violent; nor is it necessary that it should come from below.” and the golden nugget: “a government may grow anarchic as much as a people.” desperation is the natural breeding ground of anarchy. and governments are sweating lead over the fading global economy. their central banks have already shelled it with $$60 trillion worth of debt since 2009. only under such a furious barrage of debt can the economy possibly recover, the theory being. and now the world’s debt load, public and private, weighs in mountain-high at $$200 trillion- almost three times the size of the global economy. economist james dale davidson crunched the numbers. assume the interest on this $$200 trillion is 2 %, he says. that means the economy would have to grow by 6%- 300% of gdp- to simply cover the interest charge on the outstanding debt. and that, according to davidson, implies a $$500 billion annual deficit. there’s a word describing an economy growing at less than half the rate to meet its debt load: unsustainable. now that the central banks have emptied the magazines to fight the great recession, there’s no powder to battle the next

the financial crisis of 2008 was just a warm up act for the economic horror show that is coming % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the people out there that believe that the u.s. economy is experiencing a permanent recovery and that very bright days are ahead for us should have their heads examined. unfortunately, what we are going through right now is simply just a period of “hopetimism” between two financial crashes. things may seem relatively stable right now, but it won’t last long. the truth is that the financial crisis of 2008 was just a warm up act for the economic horror show that is coming. nothing really got fixed after the crash of 2008. we are living in the biggest debt bubble in the history of the world, and it has gotten even bigger since then. the “too big to fail” banks are larger now than they have ever been. americans continue to run up credit card balances like there is no tomorrow. tens of thousands of manufacturing facilities and millions of jobs continue to leave the country. we continue to consume far more than we produce and we continue to become poorer as a nation. none of the problems that caused the crisis of 2008 have been solved and we are even weaker financially than we were back then. so why in the world are so many people so optimistic about the economy right now? just take a look at the chart posted below. it shows the

Article 4 - inflation, deflation, or discontinuity?
inflation, deflation, or discontinuity? (before it's news) a question that seems to come up quite often is, “are we going to have inflation or deflation?” people want to figure out how to invest. because of this, they want to know whether to expect a rise in prices, or a fall in prices, either in general, or in commodities, in the future. the traditional “peak oil” response to this question has been that oil prices will tend to rise over time. there will not be enough oil available, so demand will outstrip supply. as a result, prices will rise both for oil and for food which depends on oil. i see things differently. i think the issue ahead is deflation for commodities as well as for other types of assets. at some point, deflation may “morph” into discontinuity. it is the fact that price falls too low that will ultimately cut off oil production, not the lack of oil in the ground. even with little oil, there will still be some goods and services produced. these goods and services will not necessarily be available to holders of assets of the kind we have today. instead, they will tend to go to those who produced them, and to those who win them by fighting over them. up and down escalator economies it seems to me that economies operate on two kinds of escalators–an up escalator, and a down escalator. the up escalator is driven by a favorable feedback

Article 5 - the largest debt bomb in human history is about to go boom!
the largest debt bomb in human history is about to go boom! (before it's news) the media doesn’t seem to be talking much about national debt these days, perhaps because under the trump administration it actually reduced by $$12b in january? unfortunately, that’s nothing but a drop in the bucket because our debt levels are at the highest point in human history. and not just national debt but corporate and personal debt levels as well. and the united states is not alone in this… in the following video, right wing news looks at how the american and global economy has largely been propped up by debt-fueled spending. this is what a hundred years of credit expansion will do, and the only question is when, not if, this house of cards will come crumbling down. will you be prepared when the inevitable occurs? do not miss (2/27/17): economic recovery? no, get ready for the retail apocalypse (video) subscribe to the top stories of the week in the newsletter here www.thelastgreatstand.com michael snyder writes: for more than 100 years global debt levels have been rising, and now we are potentially facing the greatest debt crisis in all of human history. never before have we seen such a level of debt saturation all over the planet, and pretty much everyone understands that this is going to end very, very badly at some point. the only real question is when it will happen. many believe that the current global debt super cycle began

Article 6 - taxes are the elephant in every room
taxes are the elephant in every room (before it's news) ten years ago we were on a path to paying off the country’s debt. in fact, if we had stayed on the same trajectory the debt might be paid off already. but then we cut taxes even more, and raised the military budget even more, and the deficits and resulting debt exploded. this sequence — deficits caused by tax cuts and military spending incerases — should be stated clearly at the start of every meeting that discusses deficits and debt. i am in chicago to cover the clinton global initiative (cgi) – america, which is discussing practical, scalable projects to create jobs here. i will write more about the meeting but wanted to hit a few of the points right now. obama: president obama gives a press conference today and talks about how taxes have to be part of the deficit equation. republicans scream. clinton: here at the cgi-america former president clinton carefully says that we need taxes to be higher, and the crowd of millionaires and billionaires breaks out in spontaneous applause. peterson: also at cgi “deficit hawk” pete peterson says that “our long-term debt threatens our long-term economic future,” and he’s right. (i wish he would get off of social security because it doesn’t contribute a dime to the debt, but otherwise he is right.) he also says the defense budget is “unchecked.” wow is he right about that. but ten years

Article 7 - how sound money principles can bolster your personal finances
how sound money principles can bolster your personal finances (before it's news) sound money principles can serve to help grow the economy and restrain government. the political class, however, doesn’t particularly want to restrain itself. washington, d.c. is addicted to the easy money policies that have enabled $$20 trillion in national debt accumulation and tens of trillions more in unfunded liabilities. even with a new and unconventional gop president who vows to take on waste and overregulation, the built-in momentum of “mandatory” spending means the trump budgets won’t be balanced. the debt will keep growing – and likely at a faster pace than the economy. thus, political demand for the federal reserve’s artificially low interest rates and treasury bond purchases will continue to be strong. short of a currency crisis that forces a monetary revolution, sound money reform efforts will have to proceed in baby steps. any fundamental proposed changes – such as tying the currency supply to gold and silver reserves – will encounter enormous resistance from congress, the federal reserve, and its member banks. a metallic standard would also be roundly opposed by wall street, which benefits from the fed’s artificial inflation of the financial sector. you don’t have to wait for the politicians… even if the current monetary order proves too well entrenched to be upended within your lifetime, sound dollar principles can still be valuable to you and your family. apply some of the timeless lessons of honest money to your personal finances, and you’ll avoid dangerous pitfalls while protecting and growing

Article 1 - every market collapse is different
this is an extraordinary period for american investors. caution should be their compass. it would be an error to expect a speedy correction like the one that followed the last major stock market implosion. fifteen years ago president ronald reagan asked me to head the commission to examine the market crash of october 1987. from the close of trading on oct. 13, 1987, to the close of trading on oct. 19, 1987, the dow jones industrial average fell 769 points, or 31 percent. in those four days of trading, the value of all outstanding united states stocks decreased by almost $1 trillion. on oct. 19 alone, the dow fell by 508 points, or 22.6 percent. only the crash of 1929 approaches the 1987 decline in magnitude. the conclusion we reached in the fall of 1987 was that the market was not equipped to handle the volume that arose so suddenly. the recommendations of our report -- improved clearance and settlement procedures, the adoption of circuit breakers and an increase in capacity -- were put into place. the crash was the result of a structural problem. valuations were not the culprit. the present market collapse is different; it was caused by vastly overblown valuations. the stock market has been in a colossal bubble, a delusion born in the late 1990's that reached its zenith in 2000. while not common, bubbles have always been a

Article 2 - the nation: vertigo; econ 2001: tips for the shellshocked
whatever this period is -- a recession or a slowdown -- it could be over quickly because the problems and solutions are much more immediately evident than in the past. but the downturn could well turn out to be more extended than in previous cycles. according to one theory making the rounds, this cycle is not so much about demand exceeding supply -- the usual trigger for inflation -- but about overinvestment by businesses in technology, equipment and factories. in short, the problem may not be too much money chasing too few goods, as in the past; indeed, this cycle has been characterized by an almost total lack of inflation. rather, it may be too much investment chasing too little return. in that case, the economy might not get back on its feet until businesses begin investing heavily again, and they won't do that until they work off their overcapacity. and that process could be delayed by consumers, whose confidence has been eroding. individuals helped fuel the investment boom by sinking their money into stocks rather than savings accounts. but now they find themselves with shrinking portfolios, heavy debt loads and little in the way of a buffer to help them through tough times. some economists think the idea of overinvestment leading to a sustained downturn is exaggerated. but others say recent corporate announcements of steep reductions in capital spending, plus faltering sales and profits among technology companies, suggest there is something to the notion. lesson no. 2: if productivity fades, we're toast. perhaps the most fundamental question facing the economy is whether the

Article 3 - japan and u.s.: bubble, bubble, toil and trouble
''it takes more than a bubble to become japan,'' said adam posen, a former fed staff member and a senior fellow at the institute for international economics in washington. ''but,'' he added, ''there's no question that the props for keeping up growth are going away.'' the fed is clearly concerned that it is flirting with danger. the risk remains small that the economy will remain in the doldrums for years but the weak demand for new goods has caused prices nearly to stop growing and presented perhaps the single biggest economic threat: deflation. if the american economy grows less than many forecasters expect, prices could begin falling and set off a dangerous chain of events similar to the one afflicting japan. consumers there have cut their spending, waiting for future bargains, and some are unable to pay off debts that are effectively growing more burdensome by the month. reflecting the seriousness of the debate here, two top fed officials dissented last week from alan greenspan, the chairman, and voted to reduce interest rates again. having cut rates 11 times last year to lower the cost of borrowing, the fed has helped prop up the economy but has yet to end the downturn altogether. ''i don't know at what point welcome disinflation might morph into unwelcome deflation,'' robert d. mcteer, the president of the dallas federal reserve and one of the two dissenters, said in a speech on monday. ''i don't think we're there yet.'' ''but

Article 4 - the hangover years
that was some party we had. but the boom years are long over now, a rapidly receding memory, and we're still reeling a bit from our drunken excess. unfortunately, this is one hangover that won't be cured with a couple of aspirins and a nap. in fact, this thing could last awhile. there was some optimistic buzz about a recovery this winter, but that has died down. this isn't the typical recession in which a few interest-rate cuts perk things right up. in fact, there is no recent precedent for our current economic condition of anemic growth amid quiescent inflation and low interest rates. it happened last in 1957-58, when a slump was followed by a slow recovery and another drop. in the 1960 presidential campaign, john f. kennedy promised to ''get the country moving again,'' which he did, sort of. but it wasn't until 1965 that unemployment rates retreated to boom-era levels. this is not to say that everyone is suffering. for a while after 9/11, economists worried that frightened consumers would stop spending. not to worry. three-bedroom fixer-uppers are going for $1 million in silicon valley, and sales of jewelry and high-end yachts are doing quite well, thank you. what's missing, though, is the capital investment that powered the expansion of the 90's. businesses are saddled with too many routers and servers, too much useless software. the internet

Article 5 - reversal of fortunes
the domestic aspect of casey’s story is more convincing, but also more familiar. american finance is broken, our regulations don’t seem to be working and the economic incentives too often are “heads i win, tails society loses.” one can agree with casey’s call for greater transparency, smaller banks, floating exchange rates, reforming the international monetary fund and limiting the oligarchic power of bankers without expecting very much to change. our pre-2008 institutions were, arguably, the result of an attempt to build a financial world on exactly those principles, which have commanded various forms of lip service for decades. the more pressing question is whether our economy is strong enough to tolerate a slowdown in borrowing from both consumers and the federal government. many observers fear not, and in any case american politicians, ever conscious of their own re-­election prospects, do not seem willing to run the experiment. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. daniel gross, an editor and columnist at the daily ticker at yahoo! finance, offers a much more optimistic view of the future, at least for the united states. in “better, stronger,

Article 6 - dollars without borders
the growing power of capital explains many of the economic stories of our day: why wall street has the whip hand over corporate performance; why the gap between executive and worker pay has widened to record levels; why even incompetent executives enjoy golden parachutes while high-performing employees can be laid off without apology. it also explains why the american labor movement is a pitiful shadow of its former self, the victim of a ""china price"" set half a world away by a seemingly limitless supply of cheap labor. most disturbing of all, faux argues, this imbalance is largely america's own doing. and if we don't change, he says, it could well be our undoing. how did things go wrong? well, they didn't entirely, as faux himself concedes. the post-cold-war period has also been one of significant global growth. the problems arose in the 1980's when neoliberals in washington, inspired by the ideas of friedrich hayek and milton friedman, began promoting free markets over keynesian ""statist"" thinking. in the new era of globalization, the prevailing ideology became, once again, the laissez-faire absolutism of the gold-standard era. yet crucially, faux argues, this thinking was applied only abroad. ""friedman and hayek failed to overturn keynes on the question of how to run a national economy,"" he writes. not only did democrats and republicans alike continue to practice keynesianism at home

Article 7 - stoking fear everywhere you look
every modern recession includes a media séance about how horrible things are and how much worse they will be, but there have never been so many ways for the fear to leak in. the same digital dynamics that drove the irrational exuberance — and marketed the loans to help it happen — are now driving the downside in unprecedented ways. the recession was actually not officially declared until last week, but the psychology that drives it had already been e-mailed, blogged and broadcast for months. i used to worry that my tivo thought i was gay — doesn’t everyone enjoy a little “project runway” at the end of a long, hard week? now i worry that my browser knows i am about to lose my job. “when everyone is talking about recession, we all feel like something has to change, even if nothing has changed for us,” said dan ariely, author of “predictably irrational,” a book that explains why people do things that defy explanation. “the media messages that are repeating doom and gloom affect every one, not just people who really have trouble and should make changes, but people who are fine. that has a devastating effect on the economy.” with unemployment, auto sales, home foreclosures and consumer confidence all benchmarking historic levels of distress, news outlets are hardly making it up. but the machinery of the economy began to freeze in place far more quickly than it has in the past, in part because so much scary data is circulating so much faster than

steve eisman of ‘big short’ sees massive changes in hedge funds etfs do well as long as the markets go up. nov 02, 2016 by vincent bielski (bloomberg) --steve eisman, a fund manager at neuberger berman group who was profiled in “the big short,” says europe still faces the risk of a financial crisis like the one portrayed in the book while the probability of such an event in the u.s. is very low. “so much leverage in the united states has been taken out of the financial system,” eisman said on bloomberg television on wednesday. “i don’t think you can say the same thing about europe, unfortunately.” eisman, who joined neuberger berman after closing his hedge fund two years ago, said the industry is going through massive changes amid lackluster performance and relentless pressure on fees. he’s concerned about the amount of money pouring into passive exchange-traded products because they are not hedged. “as long as the markets keep going up, etfs are fine,” he said. “one day there will be a market correction and you wish you were in a hedged product.” eisman was profiled in michael lewis’s book, “the big short,” and played by steve carell in the movie of the same name. the manager said u.s. economic growth has been slow because the median income hasn’t grown in 30 years and

(before it's news) be prepared for the next great transfer of wealth. buy physical silver and storable food. by charles hugh smith of two minds the bottom line is the fed can only keep the machine duct-taped together by suppressing the market’s pricing of risk. one of the grand narratives of our era is the substitution of debt for income: as earned income and disposable income have stagnated for 40 years, the gap between the rising cost of living and stagnant household income has been filled by borrowed money. money has been borrowed to replace income everywhere: consumers have borrowed money to buy things they otherwise couldn’t afford, students have borrowed over $$1 trillion to attend college, governments have borrowed money to fund wars and social spending, corporations have borrowed money to buy back their own shares, pushing stock prices higher. there’s one little problem with debt: interest must be paid on debt. let’s focus for a second on the difference between cash income and borrowing money. cash doesn’t cost money to maintain; debt does. in a functioning economy (as opposed to the dysfunctional mess we have now), cash would earn income from interest paid by borrowers. continue reading at oftwominds.com… source: http://silveristhenew.com/2014/06/30/the-next-global-meltdown-is-baked-in-connecting-the-dots-between-oil-debt-interest-rates-and-risk/

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US economy is experiencing a unique period of market volatility, with caution being advised. The 1987 stock market crash was caused by overvaluation, not structural issues as initially thought. A similar bubble has formed in the current market, driven by excessive valuations.

Experts warn that the economy may be experiencing an ""overinvestment"" crisis, where businesses invest heavily but fail to generate returns, leading to a sustained downturn. The Fed is concerned about deflation and its potential to trigger a chain of events like Japan's economic crisis.

The US labor movement is struggling due to globalization and the ""China price,"" which has led to widening income inequality. The post-Cold War era saw the promotion of free markets over Keynesian thinking, but this ideology was applied abroad, not domestically.

Recession fears are being fueled by media coverage, which can create a sense of urgency among consumers and businesses. The digital dynamics driving the irrational exuberance in the past are now contributing to the downside.

Hedge fund manager Steve Eisman notes that Europe still faces the risk of a financial crisis, while the US is unlikely to experience one due to reduced leverage. He warns that passive ETFs may not be suitable for long-term investments and that hedged products will become more important in the future.

Overall, the articles highlight the complexities of the current economic situation, with factors such as overvaluation, overinvestment, globalization, and media coverage contributing to market volatility.

(before it's news) in 1964 a young bob dylan released “the times they are a-changin’,” an anthem that defined what would shortly become known as “the generation gap.” with a mix of sympathy and sneer—“come mothers and fathers / throughout the land / and don’t criticize / what you can’t understand / your sons and your daughters / are beyond your command / your old road is / rapidly agin’ ”—dylan described an unbridgeable gulf in values, styles, and aspirations between the rising baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, and their elders, who had managed to survive the depredations of the great depression, world war ii, and the swiveling hips of elvis presley. flash forward half a century, and the boomers who once sang along with dylan have become the reactionary elders, clinging to their power and perks at the literal expense of everyone younger. there’s a new generation gap opening up, write nick gillespie and veronique de rugy, one that threatens to tear apart the country every bit as much as past confrontations over war, free love, drugs, and sitar music. this fight is about old-age entitlements and whether the me generation will do what’s right for the country and stop sucking up more and more money from their children and grandchildren. view this article.

Article 7 - kesha’s video “praying” is said to be “liberating” … it is actually about her remaining an industry slave
while praying is said to be a “liberating” song that addresses kesha’s painful past with her producer dr. luke, the video tells a whole other story. indeed, through symbolism, the video implies that kesha is still an industry slave … because that’s what she actually is. for years, kesha has been displaying all of the “symptoms” of a music industry slave. at an early age, the singer got locked into an airtight contract with sony music, under dr. luke’s label kemosabe. since then, she’s had little to no control over her professional career and personal life. like most industry slaves, kesha’s work has been replete with elite symbolism and infused with a foul, dehumanizing agenda. for example, her 2012 video die young (analyzed in this article), featured the singer repeating “we’re gonna die young” as satanic images flashed on screen. the entire thing was so blatant that even mainstream magazines such as billboard had to admit that the video was all about illuminati symbolism: “according to billboard, the video is a shout-out to the illuminati. occult symbols ubiquitously associated with the secret society such as the all-seeing eye of horus, inverted crosses, pentagrams, and triangles pervade the video.” – wikipedia, die young as if to confirm the bad omen of the song, die young was released only days prior to the sandy hook shooting,

(before it's news) veteran musician,composer & recording artist robert kramer, inspired by the recent tragic events in paris & the u.s., has released a single and music video titled “the human element”, planned for worldwide debut this christmas. creating what he terms “a musical vaccine to heal hearts and minds”, the video echoes the emotions and sentiment, exposing a global community torn apart by useless violence, showing the faces and the eyes in a parade of endless victims. in addition, embedded in the images and the sounds of the music video are positive subliminal affirmations and healing tones deliberately put into the soundtrack to “speak directly to the subconsciousness of an entire world”. “i wanted to create an audio-visual message that will reach everyone…” says kramer. “we’ve been exposed to so much evil and negativity that we lose perspective…we begin to accept it as a part of our lives, and in doing so, we feel helpless to do anything about it. it’s no longer useful to just talk about world peace. it becomes a “meme”, a catch phrase…something that sounds good, but has no action connected with it. it’s time for us as a world community to take action. we create “the human element” when we act together and actively reach out to each other. thats exactly the purpose of this song.”

Article 1 - footlong hot dogs of the apocalypse
since world war ii, america’s wealth has sheltered the population from harsh realities that other fellow humans face. but that protection is breaking down, from the greed of the super-rich and the stubborn insistence of many americans to stay focused on their footlong hot dogs and super-gulp drinks, writes phil rockstroh. by phil rockstroh almost exactly ten years ago, in june of 2002, my wife and i were driving through colorado, on our way from los angeles to new york city. in the early afternoon, while paused to tank-up our toyota corolla, at a massive convenience store/self-service gas island that boasted of “two-for-the-price-of-one, one and one half footlong hot dogs,” we watched a family of six emerge from a late model, oversized pickup truck, proceed into the store, and return with a bounty of hot dogs and super-gulp soft drinks. a few minutes later, we passed their vehicle on interstate 70, and i remarked to my wife on the connection between oversized consumer goods, oversized people, and the oversized amount of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere. i queried, “do you think they would even look up from their titanic hot dogs, if the world before them ignited into flames?” after a few more minutes, my question was answered when a series of wildfires (very much like the ones that are scorching colorado to ash and cinder, as i write these words) began

Article 2 - personal statements: whispered, growled and shouted
emily haines metric, emily haines’s main band, switches between lean guitar-driven rock and the synthesizer pulse of dance music. her debut solo album, “knives don’t have your back” (last gang), builds songs instead around a piano, and she trades metric’s bravado for breathy, moody reflections on love and loneliness: “by the way, it’s over without you. i’m in the way.” in ms. haines’s new songs, romances come apart in painful slow motion. there’s no rancor, but when she ends up singing, alone at the piano, “it’s gone/so long/we’ve got time/all the time,” she’s simply heartbreaking. solomon burke country and soul grew up as neighbors down south: both telling stories, both bending notes for emotion, both touching down in church music and the blues. but country took its instrumentation from string bands and soul from gospel and electric blues. back in the 1960’s ray charles famously turned country songs into orchestrated r&b. now the soul singer solomon burke, 66, has made “nashville” (shout! factory), singing well-chosen country songs backed by nashville musicians in country styles from bluegrass to countrypolitan. singing about lost love and money, he stokes every drama. breakups play as grand tragedies in songs like “does my ring burn your finger” (by jul

Article 3 - branden jacobs-jenkins is, and is not, writing about race
the day before i met jacobs-jenkins in new haven, we sat in a borrowed office at the tisch school to talk. he seemed nervous. much of his writing is so self-assured that it’s easy to forget how young he is. “i applied for the fulbright to investigate the stories of the mischlingskinder, the war babies,” he began. “they were a huge problem because they couldn’t blend into the rest of an incredibly homogeneous society. they were walking symbols of defeat.” in “war,” we learn that many of the mischlingskinder were put into orphanages after their fathers left germany. the mothers went on to marry and stopped visiting their children, who no longer fit into their mothers’ lives. also in the play, apes appear throughout. “every time i saw germans making theater that was about race in some way, one of three things would happen,” jacobs-jenkins explained. “one is that people would come out in grass skirts, or two, in blackface with afro wigs, or they would come out in ape costumes. i did a show over there, and it called for a black actor, and the only person they had to play him was a young arab. they put him in a grass skirt. i guess for them that means africa. photo “i saw an ‘othello’ there too, and it was rampant with gorilla imagery. so that was the initial impulse behind my including

Article 4 - a romantic who’s inspired by streisand
although the singer ann hampton callaway doesn’t sound at all like barbra streisand, to whom she paid fervent tribute on wednesday evening in her new show, “the streisand songbook,” at 54 below, the two share a fundamental, unshakable romanticism. both favor overarching, dramatic love songs, and both have the vocal equipment to infuse them with fairy tale magic. a wholehearted commitment is required to turn kitsch into gold and to loft a cri de coeur like “a piece of sky,” the michel legrand and alan and marilyn bergman ballad from “yentl,” into the stratosphere. as ms. callaway walloped it out of the ballpark, i reflected on how far she has come in the three decades since she was a polite piano bar entertainer newly arrived from chicago. she has cultivated a jazz side modeled after her other singing idol, ella fitzgerald, and become a theatrical belter, with all the body language that goes with it. ms. callaway has also written two songs ms. streisand has recorded: the gushy humanitarian anthem “at the same time” and “i’ve dreamed of you,” ms. streisand’s wedding song to james brolin, which has music by rolf lovland. she performed both on wednesday evening, accompanied by a trio with ted rosenthal on piano, martin wind on bass and tim

Article 5 - denying the imperium of death
the tens of thousands of american deaths from drug overdoses are a measure of the hopeless desperation left behind by the soul-starving socio-economic system of late-stage capitalism, writes poet phil rockstroh. by phil rockstroh according to a nationwide study conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), a greater number of u.s. americans died (approximately 65,000) from drug overdoses last year than were killed during the course of the vietnam war. all part and parcel of capitalism’s war against life itself. the emotional and physical pain, anxiety, and depression inflicted by the trauma inherent to a system sustained by perpetual exploitation has proven to be too much for a sizeable number of human beings to endure thus their need to self-medicate. the root of addiction is trauma. the soul of the nation is a casualty of war. there is not an arlington cemetery for these fallen, no hagiographic ceremonies will be performed over their graves nor statues erected in memoriam. their ghosts will howl through the long, dark night of national denial. listen to their wailing. it is an imprecatory prayer. a curse and augury … that admonishes, our fate and the fate of the nation will converge … as the nation will stagger, keening in lament, to the abyss. the solution: within each of us swells a deathless song. powerful. resonate. piercing. a song, miraculous of influence, plangent with the force

Article 6 - rock celebrities by stealth; without trying too hard, the shins have become an indie phenomenon
the first shins album, ''oh, inverted world,'' was released in 2001 by the smallish label sub pop (partly owned by time warner). megan jasper, the general manager of sub pop, remembers that everyone loved the record, but no one expected it to become a hit. ''we were hoping that we would be able to sell about 10,000,'' she said. the album has sold nearly 100,000 copies -- a benchmark that some people call indie platinum -- and sub pop has high hopes for the new shins album, ''chutes too narrow,'' which was released yesterday. there was once a time when indie-rock groups aspired to a mythical kind of solidarity: they were a unit, hanging out together and making music together and often writing songs together. now more than ever, though, much of the energy in indie-rock comes from singer-songwriters; the other band members are there only to help. like chan marshall (who records and performs as cat power) and conor oberst (who leads the free-form collective bright eyes), mr. mercer runs his band a lot like a solo project; the musicians may help with arrangements, but he gets sole publishing credit. it seems appropriate, then, that there were shins songs before there were shins. mr. mercer never went looking for band members; he was living in albuquerque, writing songs, he said, and ''people kept asking to be in the

Article 8 - critics' choice: new cds
brian mcknight ''ten''(warner brothers) brian mcknight's voice remains a slippery, wonderful thing--an index of modern erotic r&b singing, with specific traces of sam cooke and stevie wonder woven in. but his interpretation of the role of the wealthy, single, grown-up lover man with time on his hands has become as rigid as his melismatic singing is loose and sliding. on ''ten,'' his new album, he's working within a tradition, and one worth upholding, but not at the cost of such abject clich? a lot of the record operates on autopilot. never mind the tunes and arrangements, which are at times unintentionally funny. (''what's my name,'' your basic lothario's sex ballad, which begins with a harp arpeggio, and fulfills a list of '70s bedroom-soul clich?thereafter, could have been created by some of the smarter television satirists.) how about the words? ''you used to make love to me every single night,'' he sings in ''unhappy without you.'' ''girl, how can we get back to that blissful synergy?'' eww. it's not the wrong word, technically; it's just clumsy, with unfortunate corporate implications. and in ''a little too late,'' the words veer from hackneyed poetry (''forever was shorter than what i was thinking/now all we have left is yesterday

Article 3 - thanksgiving movies 2017: top 10 must-see holiday specials & films
christmas specials are a dime a dozen, almost making us forget that there are other holidays around that time. thanksgiving movies are not as common, sure, but they still exist! after all, who doesn’t like to see movies on thanksgiving weekend? it’s just such an untapped market! some of these are for the whole family, while others are for more mature audiences, but it’s honestly a matter of opinion. some are dramas, others are musical cartoons and there’s everything in between. miracle on 34th street look, i know what you’re thinking; if the whole thing is about someone who thinks he is santa claus, then it is clearly a christmas movie. still, the opening scene is new york city’s macy’s thanksgiving day parade, so i am counting it. a charlie brown thanksgiving this is probably the first movie many of you thought of when i suggested a thanksgiving movie. these plucky, little peanuts have had a monopoly on holiday specials for at least four decades. they even had an arbor day special. addams family values i’m still not sure why a summer camp puts on a thanksgiving play in the first place, but this still ends up making a really good scene. added to that, it’s nice to know that we have a good reason to watch america’s favorite family even after halloween. hannah and her sisters it starts on thanksgiving. it ends on thanksgiving. i even think there’s

have a happy and kosher thanksgiving (before it's news) 1. hey, i’ve got a great idea, why don’t i put together a post with a thanksgiving theme? that would be really cool, no one else could have thought of that, especially those canadian bloggers who for some weird reason seem to think that thanksgiving is on october 12th. of course, it seems to me that the way canada is going canada’s official holidays should be rosh hoshana, yom kippur and yom ha’atzmaut, as is already the case in the us. but i digress. let’s see if anyone i read regularly has put up a thanksgiving day theme post. rat’s kenny beat me to it. so did pam, the living mummy. hmm, kenny has a very interesting link to one of his previous posts about jack abrams and 911 and israel. a great read on this thanksgiving day. 2. there’s nothing better than turkeys stuffed with good old-fashioned zionist bullshit on thanksgiving. hey, don’t skip that link. the article is pretty informative. i hope it makes you have a tougher time swallowing all the turkey. yeah, it’s about this islamofacist woman from tulsa named stacy shusterman who inherited daddy’s oil company and the delightful charles and lynn shusterman family foundation thingy which spends about 75% of

Article 5 - sage stuffing from gourmet magazine, november 2008
sage stuffing from gourmet magazine, november 2008 (before it's news) the trifecta of thanksgiving. the turkey, the gravy (made from the drippings and turkey stock) and the stuffing. i know people love other things on the table, like cranberry sauce, sweet and mashed potatoes, but you can remove any of those items and it still looks like the thanksgiving table. however, we all know that thanksgiving needs turkey; turkey needs stuffing; stuffing needs gravy. i didn’t grow up with stuffing. at least not bread stuffing. the europeans don’t do bread stuffing. my mom’s family stuffed whatever bird they had with either rice or meat. so, once we were in the states, the thanksgiving turkey also was the recipient of rice stuffing in the main cavity and meat stuffing in the back. enter marriage to my ohio-born, all-american, stuffing-loving husband. i got out of learning to make stuffing for the first half dozen years of our marriage because we traveled; one year to my parents house, the next year to his. at my parents’, he opted for the mashed potatoes, not much caring for the unique-tasting rice stuffing. at his parents’, i avoided the bread stuffing and tried spreading the other stuff around so its absence wouldn’t be noticed on my plate. again, a new face brought about more change. dudette plopped into our lives and now, instead of going to my in-laws for

if you are going to be overseas this thanksgiving, you might be tempted to forget about the whole day altogether. talking about an all-american holiday in a place outside of the united states might come off as a tad presumptuous, after all! that said, some might want to honor their past by hosting a thanksgiving dinner with your new friends or family. if that’s what you want to do, then here are some tips for celebrating in another country! you’ll have to dig to get certain foods! depending on where you are, certain foods, like potatoes, sweet or otherwise, might be a rarity in your local markets. if you don’t want to make substitutions or forget the whole thing altogether, then you should always make sure to ask about specific foods when you go shopping. they might just have it in the back! take different measurements into consideration! we’re not just talking about the metric system here, though it is a good thing to remember! even appliances can normally be sold smaller or larger in one country compared to another. this could even mean the time it takes to cook and the sequences it entails could be different from what you expect. don’t break away too far from tradition! “treat it as a self-indulgent and elaborate way to soothe your homesickness,” says sarah khan, a writer originally from massachusetts who hosted thanksgiving dinners while living in cape town, south africa, according to conde nast traveler. added to that,

Article 7 - bummer: climate change to end practice of turkey for thanksgiving
bummer: climate change to end practice of turkey for thanksgiving (before it's news) why, yes, it is that time of the year when the climatologists trot out their scary thanksgiving stories. prior to most major holidays, and some minor ones, warmists tend to take one of three tracks: climate change will ruin the holiday, the holiday makes climate change worse, or they use the holiday to spread awareness. in this case thanksgiving in the future: no turkeys, lots of pensioners, and robot cooks welcome to thanksgiving in the future, a festive look at how we’ll be experiencing turkey day 50 years from now. we’ll have to rechristen it chicken day, because climate change will have wiped out the planet’s turkeys by then. and instead of car jams and snow flurries, you’ll whiz through a ”hyperloop” tunnel and make it to the (unseasonably warm) celebrations in good time. plus, you won’t need to snapchat your friends shots of stuffing and cranberry sauce, because one wink will prompt your google glasses to broadcast a panoramic live feed out to everyone you’ve listed as “close friend.” welcome to the last thursday in november of 2063. now, you’ve never seen a turkey, because all farm animals have pretty much gone extinct. but you’ve seen that episode of that vintage show friends where monica wears one on her head, and don’t get what all the nostalgia

here’s another excuse to pig out this thanksgiving: turkey prices are down. after suffering from an outbreak of bird flu in 2015, american turkey producers have come back in a big way. low feed costs are helping u.s. output to climb 7 percent this year to a record 6.02 billion pounds, government data show. rising supplies mean that wholesale frozen birds are fetching about 11 percent less than this time last year. the production boom is good news for thanksgiving feasters, since recent history suggests americans will eat about 46 million of the birds when they celebrate the holiday on nov. 24, according to the national turkey federation. with poultry prices falling, the average bill to feed 10 people for thanksgiving is set to drop about 0.5 percent from 2015, when the expense reached a record high. declines are also being driven by falling costs for pumpkin-pie mix and milk, according to an annual survey from american farm bureau federation. while prices for peas, fresh cranberries and sweet potatoes rose. prices for wholesale frozen birds weighing 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) to 16 pounds averaged $1.1541 a pound in the week ended nov. 18, down from $1.2922 a year earlier, according to u.s. department of agriculture data . the declines were similar for larger birds, and fresh turkey prices also fell from 2015. ‘strong margins’ “producers are trying to

Article 8 - a show in which the turkey's the thing
the creative team wanted a deep fryer that would afford the audience a view of the sizzling bird. such an item could not be found, so the production manager, jeff wild, built one from scratch, using thick acrylic. when this cauldron starts bubbling, it is the most dangerous apparatus on the stage. the audience routinely gasps when mr. reynolds (his own deep fryer stowed in the backyard of his greenwich village house) lowers the turkey into the vat. he jokes in the play that it could explode at any time. representatives of the local firehouse -- engine 54 on eighth avenue -- inspected and approved the setup, mr. wild said. the stage is equipped with four fire extinguishers, and there are four more waiting in the wings. paul m. baker, manager of media relations for underwriters laboratories, a nonprofit organization in northbrook, ill., that tests products for safety, considers fire extinguishers a worthwhile investment, to say the least. underwriters does not certify any of the commercially available turkey deep-fryers, mr. baker said in a telephone interview, adding, ''we believe they are unsafe as they are designed.'' the organization issued a press release before thanksgiving warning of the dangers of deep-frying turkeys. the fowl was just one of many unusual challenges ''dinner with demons'' posed. mr. reynolds and his director, peter askin, labored to create a script and

The content of the article seems to focus on bestsellers, book sales, and acquisitions, which does not match the subject matter of the original article. There are no contradictions or claims that are supported by the summary, but rather a clear mismatch between the article's content and the topic at hand.","The topic of lost and missing books of the Bible has been a subject of interest for many years. The articles discuss various aspects of this phenomenon.

According to Article 1, several books are considered apocryphal or deuterocanonical by some Christian denominations but are still part of the biblical canon in others. These include the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the Wisdom of Solomon.

Article 2 (del.icio.us) links to an article from The Washington Post, which explores the reasons behind the inclusion or exclusion of these books in different Christian traditions. The article suggests that the decision was influenced by factors such as geographical location, cultural background, and theological perspectives.

The articles also touch on the historical context surrounding the composition and transmission of the biblical texts. Article 4 (feeding frenzy) mentions the influence of early Christian leaders, such as Origen and Jerome, who played a significant role in shaping the canon of Scripture.

Article 5 (tanker weekly – August 15, 2010) provides no specific information on the topic but is likely included due to its mention of ""lost"" books.

Articles 6 and 7 do not provide any relevant information on the subject. Article 8 (links for February 22, 2015) also does not contain any useful content.

In general, the articles suggest that the inclusion or exclusion of lost and missing books in the Bible is a complex issue influenced by historical, cultural, and theological factors.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

In 2012, E.L. James' ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy topped the bestseller list for paperback trade fiction. The series was followed by Sylvia Day's ""Bared to You"".

In 2004, Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" and Mitch Albom's ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" were among the top-selling books.

Tyndale House announced that their book ""The Glorious Appearing"", the final novel in the Left Behind series, had sold out of its initial print run before release. The series has rivaled Harry Potter as a surprise success in the book business.

Author Don McLean wrote a book called ""The Last Testament"" which claims to be a message from God. The book was billed as a way to save readers from the apocalypse.

In 2000, Patricia Cornwell's ""Black Notice"" and Leon Uris' ""A God in Ruins"" were among the top-selling paperback books.

The British Library acquired a $14 million gospel manuscript called the St. Cuthbert Gospel for its collection.

In 2009, Debbie Macomber's ""Right Next Door"" was a bestseller in mass-market fiction. The New York Times also reported on the sales of other bestselling authors, including J.D. Robb and James Patterson.

he hates the ten commandments “in exactly the same way don mclean hates ‘american pie.’ ” he adores the most obscure and antiquated old testament strictures, “for each outdated relic of an obsolete mode of living is like a child to me.” he identifies himself as “maker of little green apples; rester of merry gentlemen; and sole knower of the beach boys.” he inflicted the potato famine on ireland because he was angry at the potatoes. why? “they know why.” in “the last testament” this divine author warns that when italy stops being shaped like a boot and starts looking like a ballet flat, armageddon will be near. the bad news is that the end may come as soon as next december. but the good news, supposedly, is that buying “the last testament” can save us. with a sales pitch that stops just short of “don’t turn the page, or we’ll shoot this dog,” the big guy notes that if a sequel needs to be written, the apocalypse can be postponed for a while. in listing other books “by the same authors,” “the last testament” ticks off two “daily show” productions (“america” and “earth”) as well as the old testament, new testament and the koran. that is because “the last testament” is billed as a message from god as transcribed by david javerbaum, the former head writer and executive producer of “the daily show with jon st

Title: financial markets
Content: whatever happened to all those lost and missing books of the bible?

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The topic of lost and missing books of the Bible has been a subject of interest for many years. The articles discuss various aspects of this phenomenon.

According to Article 1, several books are considered apocryphal or deuterocanonical by some Christian denominations but are still part of the biblical canon in others. These include the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the Wisdom of Solomon.

Article 2 (del.icio.us) links to an article from The Washington Post, which explores the reasons behind the inclusion or exclusion of these books in different Christian traditions. The article suggests that the decision was influenced by factors such as geographical location, cultural background, and theological perspectives.

The articles also touch on the historical context surrounding the composition and transmission of the biblical texts. Article 4 (feeding frenzy) mentions the influence of early Christian leaders, such as Origen and Jerome, who played a significant role in shaping the canon of Scripture.

Article 5 (tanker weekly – August 15, 2010) provides no specific information on the topic but is likely included due to its mention of ""lost"" books.

Articles 6 and 7 do not provide any relevant information on the subject. Article 8 (links for February 22, 2015) also does not contain any useful content.

In general, the articles suggest that the inclusion or exclusion of lost and missing books in the Bible is a complex issue influenced by historical, cultural,

The summary provides a clear overview of the key points in the article, including the proposed $54 billion aid package, cuts to core services, tax increases, and potential challenges to Pataki's future as governor. There are no significant contradictions between the article and the facts mentioned in the summary.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

California's special funds, which manage billions of dollars in public money, have significant discrepancies. A review found at least 17 accounts with excessive reserve cash. The state Senate budget chairman, Mark Leno, called it a ""big problem"" that these funds ""clearly have not been getting enough attention.""

Tom Tancredo proposed a plan to cut spending by 10% across the board and scrutinize every department for waste and excess. However, his plan was criticized as not nuanced enough.

The US national debt surpassed $13.3 trillion, with each taxpayer owing over $120,000. Jerry Mcnerney returned to Washington to vote on a $26 billion package that would bail out big-spending states.

A Libertarian Party event showed young people are ready for smaller government and bigger freedom. However, the party's candidate spent most of his donations on personal advisors rather than advertising.

The House GOP budget plan aims to cut $4.4 trillion from the national deficit over a decade. Critics argue that the plan is still worthless due to its complexity and lack of transparency.

A California opinion poll found growing opposition to Governor Brown's tax increase proposal, with 41% favoring it and 50% opposing it. The poll ignored data showing a significant drop in support for the proposal since April.

Governor Crist signed a $2.2 billion tax increase in Florida's budget in 2009, breaking his pledge against raising taxes. He also raised ""a historic amount of taxes, fees, licenses, and rates"" during his tenure.

Some Chris Christie supporters were upset with Governor Palin for going ""unscripted"" on Fox Business Network, where she criticized Christie for having no choice but to cut budgets due to his state's financial situation.","New York Governor George Pataki faces challenges in his re-election bid. Tom Golisano, a wealthy businessman, appears to have won the Independence Party's nomination for governor, potentially threatening Pataki's chances.

Pataki has proposed a $54 billion aid package to address New York's financial problems, but conservatives in Congress are skeptical about funding excessive requests. The proposal includes cuts to core services and tax increases, which may be unpopular with lawmakers.

Pataki's future as governor is uncertain, with some advisors suggesting he may not run for re-election. However, others believe he will seek a third term due to his popularity and the competitive nature of the election.

The state faces a $6 billion budget deficit, which may require deep spending cuts or tax increases. Options include extending a surcharge on taxable earnings or borrowing against projected revenues from casinos.

Pataki has proposed stricter limits on campaign contributions, including lower contribution limits and a ban on soft money in state races. However, his proposal is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Assembly.

The state's court system will face significant cuts, with an estimated 170 million dollars in spending reductions. The cuts may force courthouse closures or limit funding for lawyers representing low-income clients.

Pataki has taken a firm stance against raising taxes on the rich, arguing that his proposed budget will stimulate the economy by providing seed money for high-tech industries and expanding tax breaks for upstate businesses.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - on to the election
gov. george pataki got the unwelcome news yesterday that tom golisano appeared to have bested him in the race to win the independence party's nomination for governor. mr. pataki had hoped to take advantage of the loathsome new york tradition of allowing third parties to rent out their lines to the major party candidates in return for the hope of future political favors. but mr. golisano's raft of self-financed tv commercials may have swung the tide. if final tallies confirm that mr. golisano is the winner, he and his large personal fortune will become an unpredictable force in an election that otherwise pits the low-key mr. pataki against the low-key state comptroller, carl mccall. mr. golisano's main interest is the state budget, and both mr. mccall and mr. pataki can use some prodding to get them to talk frankly about new york's financial problems. the public needs a hard-fought campaign that sheds some light on the options the state faces at a time of terrible budget constraints. the present budget, created in part by governor pataki and approved by comptroller mccall, stands before the voters like a hollywood set, its paint already starting to peel. plugged with one-time revenue windfalls and papered over with other financial gimmicks, this year's budget presages a particularly difficult time next year, when a budget gap estimated in some quarters to be $

Article 2 - bush opposes more aid now for new york
an assistant to a house leader, while not dooming the proposal entirely, said: ''they're just not going to get all that. conservatives in congress are watching to see that nobody takes advantage of this crisis to fund their own pork projects.'' another assistant to a prominent republican senator urged mr. pataki, a republican, to abandon some of the more excessive requests, particularly when congress needs to cover the rising cost of the nation's war effort. ''those extraneous things that have nothing to do with recovering from the attacks will have to fall by the wayside,'' the assistant said. ''you can't go overboard on these things.'' that sentiment is being echoed even by members of new york's delegation, who complain that they had little say in outlining the plan that mr. pataki submitted. the biggest concern they have is that mr. pataki's request undercuts real needs when some conservatives in congress are looking for any reason to deny giving new york significantly more aid than it has already got. the governor and mayor rudolph w. giuliani have taken different tacks on seeking more federal aid. the mayor, most notably with a budget modification, charts and graphs, tried to demonstrate that he had put his own house in order -- cutting agency budgets, freezing $1 billion in spending -- just hours before he appeared with mr. pataki to announce the $54 billion aid package. and he stressed that the package should not be expanded to include extraneous things

Article 3 - pataki future: growing signs he won't run
""i know for a fact the governor has not told anyone he is not running,"" said one longtime adviser to mr. pataki, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation. ""i think he has told people he is inclined not to, but he leaves himself the door open."" one of mr. pataki's political advisers and former communications directors, michael mckeon, said he thinks anything is possible. ""at the end of the day, he's very likely to run for re-election,"" mr. mckeon said on monday. ""i think he's still very much up in the air, and it could go either way, but he loves the job, it gets his juices flowing, and the idea of a hard-fought, competitive race, i think, is going to be too much for him to pass up."" the question of mr. pataki's intentions is preoccupying albany, where he has held power for more than a decade. lobbyists with ties to the administration are fretting about a future in a post-pataki world, the republican party is despairing of finding a viable candidate should he not run, and some members of the republican-led state senate are pondering a future in which they, instead of the democratic-led assembly, would be the ones playing the role of the opposition. there are signs that the governor is continuing to flirt with the idea of running for president. he courted i

Article 4 - a $6 billion hole in albany's pocket is expected to grow
but so troublesome is the state's fiscal predicament that many budget watchdogs and lawmakers say the state may be forced to rely on some unpalatable alternatives, like a combination of deep spending cuts on core services and tax increases. one likely tool would be extending a surcharge on taxable earnings of more than $100,000 for single people or more than $150,000 for married couples. that surcharge, which raised the state tax rate to 7.5 percent from 6.85 percent, was to expire at the end of next year. extending the surcharge, and extending the sales tax on clothing items costing less than $110, could yield a combined $1 billion next year and $2 billion the following year, said colleen woodell, the managing director in public finance at standard & poor's rating agency. she said she fully expected the state to go that route. another option being mentioned by lawmakers and others is borrowing against projected revenues from casinos planned for the catskills, although pataki administration officials say that is not being considered at this time. the state faced an even larger budget gap of $11.5 billion two years ago, but then it was coming off the economic downturn from the sept. 11 attacks and was able to close much of the gap by borrowing more than $4 billion against its share of future tobacco revenues, a remedy unavailable this time around. fiscal analysts say that while the projected budget deficit is not as bad as it was in 

Article 5 - pataki seeks stricter limits on campaign contributions
albany, may 26 - with just a month left in the legislative session, gov. george e. pataki proposed campaign finance legislation thursday that would lower contribution limits, ban soft money in state races and toughen enforcement of campaign finance laws. the governor has made the proposals in the past, but this year he divided them into two separate bills, an approach that officials and lobbyists said could ease negotiations with the state legislature by offering more room for compromise. the democratic-controlled assembly passed its own bill in january calling for public financing of state elections, which governor pataki, a republican, does not support. but the assembly bill does have items in common with the governor's proposal, including calls to ban soft money, set lower contribution limits and close loopholes that allow corporations to exceed contribution limits by donating through subsidiaries. the republican-led state senate has yet to pass campaign finance legislation this year. civic groups have long complained that new york's campaign finance laws are far too lax, especially when compared with the much stronger laws in new york city and at the federal level. they say contribution limits are high, the amount of information disclosed is limited, and there are many loopholes to avoid contribution limits. advertisement continue reading the main story while corporations are banned from giving contributions of more than $5,000 to individual candidates, the new york times reported in february that many were able to circumvent the limit by making unlimited soft money donations to the so-called housekeeping accounts

judge lippman was one of many officials around the state, in government and elsewhere, who scrambled to take stock of the state’s budget deal, which mr. cuomo announced in a triumphant ceremony at the capitol on sunday that was filled with grinning faces but was sparse on details. the cuts to the court system, which has about 15,500 employees, came two months after mr. cuomo chastised the judicial branch for not agreeing to a 10 percent reduction in spending that he imposed on state agencies. (mr. cuomo also cut his own budget 10 percent, as did the state comptroller and the attorney general.) photo a month ago, judge lippman submitted a revised budget that would cut $100 million in spending, or about 4 percent, from the $2.7 billion he had requested, an amount roughly unchanged from the past year’s budget. the $170 million cut will equal about 6 percent. mr. cuomo and the legislative leaders settled on the larger figure so that the court system would shoulder “a more proportionate share of the state’s reductions,” josh vlasto, a spokesman for the governor, said. judge lippman said he did not know whether the additional cut would force the closing of any courthouses. he also was not sure whether he would still be able to increase state financing for lawyers to represent the poor in cases dealing with foreclosures, child support and other civil matters. at

Article 7 - pataki takes firmest stand against higher tax on rich
mr. pataki also lodged a counter-attack on joseph l. bruno, the senate majority leader, who said monday that the governor's planned reduction in school aid would drive up local property taxes, a position that the assembly speaker, sheldon silver, has been stating since jan. 29, when the governor presented his budget. mr. pataki said his proposed $1.2 billion reduction in school aid averaged about 4 percent a district, far less than the percentage by which state government agencies have been asked to reduce their spending. ''we're not looking to raise state taxes,'' mr. pataki said. ''we're not looking to raise local taxes. obviously, i would like to have more funds for schools, everyone would like to have more funds for schools, but the way we've been able to make the record investments in education, in health care, in the environment, over the course of the past five, six, seven, years has been because we have put in place the policies that created the right economic climate so the private sector grew and generated the revenues, the government revenues, that we could use for school districts.'' yet the three-term governor has been barraged by criticism from all sides, including powerful labor unions, newspaper editorial boards and standard-bearers in his own republican party who have split with him over his insistence on cutting health care and education to close an $11.5 billion gap in the state budget. a statewide poll

Article 8 - budget in albany has few cuts but relies on one-time revenue
some democrats said they would have preferred to have raised income taxes temporarily rather than rely on what they characterized as fiscal gimmicks. the republican governor, however, dug in his heels in negotiations and refused to raise income or business taxes. mr. pataki, who said he would approve the budget, has argued that it is the right time to spend the savings the state has built up over the last five years to make it through a tough economic time. he and the senate republicans predict the budget will stimulate the economy by providing $600 million in seed money for high-tech industries and expanding tax breaks for upstate businesses. they say that tax collections will then grow. ''we did what few other states did, and that was to put away money for a rainy day,'' mr. pataki's chief spokesman, michael mckeon, said. ''we are ready to weather this storm without massive cutbacks you see all over the country.'' all told, the budget raises spending about 6 percent, though the portion paid through state taxes and fees will go up only 3 percent. it also imposes some new taxes and increases a number of obscure fees to bring in about $85 million more. the tax on cellular telephones, for instance, will rise to $1.20 a month from 70 cents to get $38 million. hunting and fishing fees will be raised to generate about $6 million more. the budget also counts on reducing the state work force by at least

Title: legislature is assailed by pataki over budget
Content: the democrat-led assembly and the republican-led senate overcame partisan differences to pass the stripped-down plan in a last-ditch effort to compel the governor to talk about adding some spending to his budget. for months, mr. pataki has said the state cannot afford to spend more than the $83.6 billion he proposed in january because of the shaky national economy. michael mckeon, the governor's chief spokesman, said, ''the governor's going to make it clear to the people of this state in every corner of this state that he stands against the albany insiders who want to spend more than the people can afford.'' the comptroller, h. carl mccall, a democrat who is planning to run for governor next year, said the $79.6 billion spending plan the legislature passed was ''not a good budget'' but laid the blame squarely at mr. pataki's feet. he said the governor had avoided albany and failed to broker a deal with lawmakers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the budget essentially holds spending at last year's levels or lower in most state programs, except for a $382 million increase in school aid. it cuts about $4 billion from the governor's proposed budget, including several large blocks of money used for economic development and welfare programs. legislative leaders are betting it will inflict so much pain on local governments that political pressure will mount on the governor to negotiate a supplemental budget that will include some of the lawmakers' priorities. there is no question that the budget will make it difficult for mr. pataki to govern. dozens of social service programs, from medicaid payments to day care for the working poor, are facing a $1.5 billion shortfall this year unless an ancillary budget is passed, the governor's budget office said. but the legislature also eliminated a number of large funds dear to mr. pataki over which it has little control. among them is a $150 million fund for conserving wilderness, a $1.5 billion fund of unspent federal welfare money that can be used for social programs and more than $300 million in economic development grants. mr. pataki began the day with a fishing exhibition in syracuse and then held news conferences in rochester and buffalo before returning to albany late in the day to speak to reporters. all day, he hammered away at the legislature for passing what he said was a budget full of holes that would cause many programs to run out of money. he also chastised lawmakers for taking a vacation before finishing the job. lawmakers, however, countered that it was the governor who had

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
New York Governor George Pataki faces challenges in his re-election bid. Tom Golisano, a wealthy businessman, appears to have won the Independence Party's nomination for governor, potentially threatening Pataki's chances.

Pataki has proposed a $54 billion aid package to address New York's financial problems, but conservatives in Congress are skeptical about funding excessive requests. The proposal includes cuts to core services and tax increases, which may be unpopular with lawmakers.

Pataki's future as governor is uncertain, with some advisors suggesting he may not run for re-election. However, others believe he will seek a third term due to his popularity and the competitive nature of the election.

The state faces a $6 billion budget deficit, which may require deep spending cuts or tax increases. Options include extending a surcharge on taxable earnings or borrowing against projected revenues from casinos.

Pataki has proposed stricter limits on campaign contributions, including lower contribution limits and a ban on soft money in state races. However, his proposal is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Assembly.

The state's court system will face significant cuts, with an estimated 170 million dollars in spending reductions. The cuts may force courthouse closures or limit funding for lawyers representing low-income clients.

Pataki has taken a firm stance against raising taxes on the rich, arguing that his proposed budget will stimulate the economy by providing seed money for high-tech industries and expanding tax breaks for upstate businesses.

California's special funds, which manage billions of dollars in public money, have significant discrepancies. A review found at least 17 accounts with excessive reserve cash. The state Senate budget chairman, Mark Leno, called it a ""big problem"" that these funds ""clearly have not been getting enough attention.""

Tom Tancredo proposed a plan to cut spending by 10% across the board and scrutinize every department for waste and excess. However, his plan was criticized as not nuanced enough.

There are no contradictions or claims that are not supported by the facts in the article. The summary also provides additional context about the team's recent performance and challenges, which is consistent with the tone of the article.","Here's a concise summary of the articles:

The New York Knicks secured a 98-97 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, with Carmelo Anthony scoring 28 points and hailing it as one of his most satisfying victories. The Knicks' 9th win in 10 games marked their second buzzer-beating victory in five games.

In another game, Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks to a 89-86 road win over the Boston Celtics, snapping an 11-game losing streak at TD Garden. Anthony's 27th straight game with at least 20 points was highlighted by his defensive performance against Kevin Garnett.

Meanwhile, Steph Curry and Omar Casspi engaged in a thrilling 3-point shot duel during a Sacramento Kings-Oakland Warriors matchup. Curry scored 23 points and achieved a triple-double, while Casspi went 4-4 from 3-point land with 36 points.

The NBA released an officiating report stating that James Harden should have been called for an offensive foul before his game-winning shot over Andre Iguodala in the Houston Rockets' 97-96 victory over the Golden State Warriors.

A recent survey found that Knicks fans had largely forgotten about Jeremy Lin, with many not knowing what ""Linsanity"" referred to. The team's hot start to the season has overshadowed last year's excitement surrounding Lin's breakout performance.

The 2013 NBA All-Star Game saw the West win 143-138, with Chris Paul named MVP. Kyrie Irving won the Foot Locker three-point contest, and Toronto Raptors' Terrence Ross took home the Sprite slam dunk contest trophy.

Finally, a video of a Filipino boy dominating an arcade basketball hoop has gone viral, showcasing his incredible skills and leaving many to wonder if he might be the future of the NBA.","The New York Knicks have been showing signs of improvement, with players like Landry Fields and Toney Douglas making significant contributions. In a recent game against the Sacramento Kings, Harrellson had a breakout performance, scoring 5 points from the field. The team's defense has also been strong, holding opponents to low shooting percentages.

In another game, Childs scored 13 straight points, including 10 in the fourth quarter, to help the Knicks win. Coach Jeff Van Gundy praised the team's effort, saying ""it was just 24 guys who suited up, willing to give everything they had.""

However, the team has also struggled with discipline, with fights breaking out during games. Kurt Thomas was fined $10,000 and received a two-game suspension for instigating a fight against Indiana's Jalen Rose.

The Knicks have also been struggling to contain opponents like DeMar DeRozan, who averaged 33 points per game against the Raptors. Coach Van Gundy admitted that he hasn't come up with the right plan to stop DeRozan and his teammates.

Despite these challenges, the team has shown signs of improvement, including a recent three-game winning streak. Players like Zach Randolph and Chris Duhton have been performing well, and the team's defense has been strong. However, the Knicks still face significant challenges ahead, including catching up with the Miami Heat in the standings.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

(before it's news) new york knicks forward carmelo anthony secured one of the most satisfying victories of his career against the boston celtics, leading his team to an 89-86 road win at the td garden. the knicks’ 89-86 triumph thursday night snapped their 11-game losing streak at boston and also was a measure of revenge for a defeat against the celtics at madison square garden on jan. 7, when anthony jawed both on and off the court with veteran kevin garnett and earned himself a one-game suspension. the teams’ latest meeting was a shenanigan-free, defensive-minded contest that was not decided until late in the fourth quarter, when the celtics shot themselves in the foot with turnovers on two of their last three possessions. anthony led the way for the knicks with 28 points, his 27th straight game with at least 20 points dating back to nov. 16. the star forward, who was booed throughout the night by the celtics’ fans, also hauled down nine rebounds. in the teams’ previous game, anthony was so rattled by garnett’s trash-talking that he waited outside the celtics’ bus after the contest in a bid to continue his war of words with

steph curry is in the middle on a historic tear this season–there’s no other way to put it. omar casspi, a three-point specialist on the sacramento kings, is a role player on a team struggling to stay relevant and seven games behind .500. but last night, the two of them entered into a duel that was a hell of a lot of fun to watch. in the last 3:15 of the second quarter, the two combined for 10-10 from behind the three point line. with the exception of one layup from darren collison, casspi and curry were the only two people to score. casspi went 4-4 from 3-point land on his way to a total of 13-18 night (9-12 on threes), giving him a total of 36 points. curry went 6-6 (5-5 from 3-point land) on his way to a total of 23 points and a triple-double. a lot of sites have the highlights from the oc corall shootout, but here’s the full series uninterrupted. couple things i’d like to point out: believe it or not, that step back three from curry was his first points of the game. at 2:20 left in the quarter, casspi and gay try to save the ball under their own basket. never do this, even on a lost rebound. you leave the offense an opportunity to score with a defender out

share this: in an officiating report released by the nba on friday, the league said officials should have called houston rockets guardjames harden for an offensive foul before his game-winning shot over andre iguodala in thursday’s 97-96 victory over the golden state warriors. “harden (houston) initiates the contact with iguodala (golden state) to create space and dislodges him from his legal guarding position,” the league’s “last two minute report” read. harden knocked down a two-pointer with 2.7 seconds remaining after pushing off iguodala to create space for the step-back jumper. he finished with a game-high 35 points as well as nine assists and eight rebounds as the rockets protected their home court and avoided a sweep, though the warriors were playing their second straight game without reigning mvp stephen curry (ankle). “the last shot was typical of what james does,” interim head coach j.b. bickerstaff said, per espn.com. “the move, we’ve seen before. the finish, we’ve seen before. you do get spoiled by it at times, but in these biggest of moments, you can’t help but appreciate it.” the internal reports are released to the public as part of the nba’s ongoing push for officiating transparency. while the league can’t do anything to change missed calls, it’s an act of good faith for the nba to acknowledge

new york — it’s only been about two months into the brooklyn nets era, but their rivalry with the knicks has already disappeared. or, as knicks fan katie mansfield described it, “it’s faded away down one of those dark, eerie streets you’re too afraid to go down when you’re deep in brooklyn.” the nets pulled off a tough overtime win over the knicks in their first game together, but the knicks won the next two outings over brooklyn. carmelo anthony scored 45 and 31 points in each of those wins. “if you’re the nets, it has to be disheartening to already know that carmelo will be embarrassing you for many years to come,” said knicks fan tristan patel. “it’s becoming very much like the ‘chipper jones-mets’ relationship… yeah, that brutal.” “my big brother used to do dangerous wrestling moves on me when i was little and forced me to suck the teat of the cows in our family barn,” said nets owner mikhail prokhorov. “now it feels like that nightmare is happening all over again with the knicks.” there seems to be a severe lack of rivalry even between knick and net fans. “that’s probably because there are no nets fans,” argues patel. “the knicks being better than the nets right isn’t even enjoyable because there are no net fans to humiliate. even when you think

Article 1 - there's little to say in knicks' defense
''the thing about this team is most of us have been around each other for two, three or four years, and so we shouldn't be so inconsistent,'' said allan houston, who scored 23 points but gave up the bulk of mitch richmond's 32 points. ''we're playing like we just got together. we don't know what's going on out there. ''teams just don't shoot 60 percent. i think mitch hit a lot of tough shots, but it's not just him. if i look back at the tape and i see that he just made tough shots, fine. but i don't think myself or we made him take tough shots.'' in overtime, it was rod strickland who made the most devastating shots of all. in overtime, sprewell, who had scrambled to keep his team alive for four quarters, collapsed in the critical moments. the knicks had a 108-106 lead when sprewell zipped an ill-advised pass to the top of the key and watched as juwan howard turned it into a fast-break layup despite being fouled by charlie ward with 2 minutes 22 seconds left. sprewell had a chance to tie the game, but missed one of two free throws with 1:27 remaining. a possession later, strickland launched an arcing 17-footer over the outstretched hand of patrick ewing that fell softly into the net for a

landry fields had a breakout game with 21 points. and toney douglas (17 points) settled into his playmaker role, dishing out 8 assists and connecting repeatedly with chandler. the knicks thus salvaged a three-game trip that started with losses to golden state and to the los angeles lakers. “i thought toney played like he did last year,” coach mike d’antoni said, praising the young backcourt of douglas and fields. “they will be products of, if the ball moves, they’ll play better.” photo for the first time in three games, the ball did move, to the tune of 26 assists, with anthony contributing five and bill walker six. it helped, too, that the knicks played a sacramento team that seems to lack an identity at either end of the court. marcus thornton led the kings with 14 points. tyreke evans, the former rookie of the year, had only 13 points. jimmer fredette, the rookie sensation who has energized kings fans, had only 7 points, going 2 for 10 from the field. the best rookie on the floor, though, was harrellson, who was taken with the 45th pick last june — 35 picks after fredette. he made his first attempt, a 3-pointer, then hit three more from the arc, finishing 5 for 11 from the field. “it

Article 3 - childs leaves hard road behind him
childs thought long about this after the game was over, this 83-82 thriller won by the irrepressible knicks and their backup point guard. he scored 13 straight knicks points, including 10 to begin the fourth quarter, keeping them in a game they were about to throw away. but when the offensive options dwindled to one, the most confident role player in america morphed into the knicks' go-to guy, maneuvering his 6-foot-2-inch frame past alonzo mourning and the miami front line, scoring on driving layups and drawing fouls, knocking down important jump shots. fitting, no, that childs helped end the madness? for all the nothing-to-lose loyalists who gave up their bodies for miami coach pat riley the past two weeks -- bowen, carter, dan majerle and clarence weatherspoon -- the knicks finally countered with one of their own. knicks-heat has never been about ego, multimillionaires or petulant franchise players. it is about hard-core ball, gym rats and hoop junkies, trading shots like two youngsters in a pillow fight who can't seem to get the other one to go groggy and drop.

the victory was the knicks' second straight with camby sidelined because of a sprained left ankle and sent them into wednesday's road game against the woeful atlanta hawks on a three-game winning streak. it was also won in the fashion that van gundy likes best: defensively. after being scorched for 57 percent shooting in a first half that saw them trail by as many as 16 points, the knicks held orlando, which played without the injured grant hill, to almost unfathomable 26.2 percent shooting over the third and fourth quarters. trailing by 8 points, 82-74, with 5 minutes 11 seconds remaining, the knicks outscored the magic, 11-2, while forcing orlando to miss its last 12 shots and commit two turnovers down the stretch. strickland played a key role in the defense, helping to hold the outstanding mcgrady to just 2 points on 1-of-6 shooting in the fourth. until strickland helped to shackle him, mcgrady had been dazzling, scoring 23 of his game-high 25 points through the first three quarters. ''that's just what i do,'' strickland said of his defense on mcgrady.

Article 7 - knicks let a victory slip away in overtime
“it happens — even in phoenix, they had some dry spells at times,” said crawford, referring to coach mike d’antoni’s former team. “it’s hard to imagine it happening, but it definitely happens.” dallas ended a five-game losing streak — its longest since march 2000 — while snuffing the knicks’ proudest streak. the knicks had been 6-0 when scoring 100 points. they also have rarely had to manufacture a win in a tight game. “that’s something that will come with time,” said chris duhon, who had 16 points and 12 assists. “we got to get used to winning. we got to get used to winning games late in the fourth quarter, when each possession is valuable. it’s nothing that’s going to come overnight. it’s nothing that coach d’antoni can prepare us for.” photo zach randolph led the knicks with 27 points and 18 rebounds. it was his eighth consecutive double-double — the longest streak by a knick since patrick ewing in 1995. the knicks led by 112-105 with less than three minutes to play. the mavericks scored the next 7 points to tie the game. the knicks blew several chances to retake the lead, including point-blank misses by randolph and quentin richardson. jason terry missed a potential game-winning shot, a 16-footer

Article 8 - knicks have no answer for carter
the knicks' problems extended beyond carter. the raptors led by 28-11 after the first quarter, and carter had only 2 points. but his pendulum moves seemed to put the knicks in a teamwide trance. it was evident in their slow-reacting defense, chaotic offense and sloppy ball-handling (19 turnovers). it was clear when allan houston (10 points) couldn't fight through a screen to stop dell curry's first-quarter flurry, and patrick ewing (16 points) couldn't slog through the paint quickly enough to catch up with antonio davis (17 points). it was enough to leave coach jeff van gundy in the kind of self-flogging state that has become familiar when his team begins flirting with danger. ''i haven't made it crystal clear what we need to do against these guys,'' said van gundy, whose team dropped the season series, 3-1, to the raptors and allowed carter to average 33 points a game. ''carter knows that we know we don't want to play him. we didn't want to compete against him. i'm frustrated with myself. i haven't come up with the right plan.''. van gundy tried larry johnson, then sprewell, then marcus camby, and not one of them could get close enough to put his body on carter.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here's a concise summary of the articles:

The New York Knicks secured a 98-97 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, with Carmelo Anthony scoring 28 points and hailing it as one of his most satisfying victories. The Knicks' 9th win in 10 games marked their second buzzer-beating victory in five games.

In another game, Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks to a 89-86 road win over the Boston Celtics, snapping an 11-game losing streak at TD Garden. Anthony's 27th straight game with at least 20 points was highlighted by his defensive performance against Kevin Garnett.

Meanwhile, Steph Curry and Omar Casspi engaged in a thrilling 3-point shot duel during a Sacramento Kings-Oakland Warriors matchup. Curry scored 23 points and achieved a triple-double, while Casspi went 4-4 from 3-point land with 36 points.

The NBA released an officiating report stating that James Harden should have been called for an offensive foul before his game-winning shot over Andre Iguodala in the Houston Rockets' 97-96 victory over the Golden State Warriors.

A recent survey found that Knicks fans had largely forgotten about Jeremy Lin, with many not knowing what ""Linsanity"" referred to. The team's hot start to the season has overshadowed last year's excitement surrounding Lin's breakout performance.

The 2013 NBA All-Star Game saw the West win 143-138, with Chris Paul named MVP

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The New York Knicks have been showing signs of improvement, with players like Landry Fields and Toney Douglas making significant contributions. In a recent game against the Sacramento Kings, Harrellson had a breakout performance, scoring 5 points from the field. The team's defense has also been strong, holding opponents to low shooting percentages.

In another game, Childs scored 13 straight points, including 10 in the fourth quarter, to help the Knicks win. Coach Jeff Van Gundy praised the team's effort, saying ""it was just 24 guys who suited up, willing to give everything they had.""

However, the team has also struggled with discipline, with fights breaking out during games. Kurt Thomas was fined $10,000 and received a two-game suspension for instigating a fight against Indiana's Jalen Rose.

The Knicks have also been struggling to contain opponents like DeMar DeRozan, who averaged 33 points per game against the Raptors. Coach Van Gundy admitted that he hasn't come up with the right plan to stop DeRozan and his teammates.

Despite these challenges, the team has shown signs of improvement, including a recent three-game winning streak. Players like Zach Randolph and Chris Duhton have been performing well, and the team's defense has been strong. However, the Knicks still face significant challenges ahead, including catching up with the Miami Heat in the standings.

Article 2-5: These articles are identical to Article 1, suggesting a repetition or error in posting. They discuss the upcoming ""Brexit"" vote and the rise of populist euroscepticism across Europe.

Article 6: The lecture slides on Brexit and Euroscepticism provide an analysis of the topic, highlighting the geographic and cultural contexts that shape these developments.

Article 7: This article critiques the animated map accompanying a science article by Bouckaert et al., which depicts language differentiation in Indo-European languages. The author argues that the map's contour shadings and branching lines are misleading and difficult to interpret.

Article 8: ""The Geography of 'Book'"" explores the spatial distribution of words for a given meaning, revealing patterns of language spread and contact. The article examines the geography of words for ""book"", which were borrowed along with the concept of a book and often accompanied by important religious texts.

These articles demonstrate Geocurrents' focus on providing geographical information and analyses of current global events, as well as its exploration of cultural and linguistic contexts that shape world developments.","Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Dr. Joseph H. Greenberg, a linguist at Stanford University, has classified most world languages into just a handful of major groups. He is publishing two volumes on Eurasiatic, a proposed superfamily that includes languages from Portugal to Japan.

The article ""Language Arrogance"" criticizes the alarmist prediction about global language disappearance and the narrow view of language change. It argues that scholars should consider the emergence of new languages and dramatic changes within existing ones.

In ""My Dinner with Adrià,"" chef Ferran Adrià is featured, using his famous cooking techniques to create foams, pearls, and infusions. He shops for ingredients in a traditional way, but faces resistance from shopkeepers who prefer more modern methods.

The article ""Mike Pence, Mosul, Jim Mattis: Your Morning Briefing"" reports on the Trump administration's proposal to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, which could disrupt US partners across the region.

Researchers are studying the use or nonuse of subject pronouns in Spanish and English. They found that Spanish speakers from the Caribbean tend to use more pronouns than those from Central and South America.

The article ""The Retreat of the Tongue of the Czars"" discusses the decline of Russian language abroad, with the Kremlin trying to promote its study and castigate neighbors who speak other languages.

response to quentin d. atkinson (before it's news) we would like to thank quentin d. atkinson for taking the time to respond to our critique of the science article by bouckaert et al., of which he is one of the authors. while he appears to restate their team’s position rather than address specific criticisms that we had voiced, we feel that we should address those issues that atkinson brings up in defense of their methodology. according to atkinson, “the inferences based on linguistic palaeontology [i.e. the approach we advocate in our critique] have thus far failed to satisfy … three requirements”. first, atkinson correctly points out that “in order to reconstruct a term to proto-indo-european, the common ancestor of all indo-european languages, it must be present in those languages that are first to branch off from the base of the tree. it is not enough to point to similar terms in some sub-groups of the family. thus, in the case of indo-european, if a word is not present in the anatolian languages at the base of the tree, there is no reason to think it was present in proto-indo-european”. this applies in particular to the words denoting vehicular meanings such as the reconstructed proto-indo-european (pie) *kwekwlos ‘wheel’, *rot-eh another term for ‘wheel’, *aks ‘axle’, *hihs- ‘thill’

Article 7 - the consistently incorrect mapping of language differentiation in bouckaert et al.
the consistently incorrect mapping of language differentiation in bouckaert et al. (before it's news) as mentioned in previous geocurrents posts, the animated map that accompanies the science article of bouckaert et al. depicts their model in action, showing the expansion and differentiation of the indo-european languages in time and space. earlier posts criticized the map’s contour shadings, which indicate high probabilities of ie languages being spoken in given areas at given times. today’s post takes on a related issue, that of the branching lines that spread across the map as the presentation unfolds, indicating both linguistic relationship and the general directions of language-group expansion. here we can clearly see that the model generates a nearly continuous stream of misleading information and outright error. analyzing the ramifying lines on animated map is challenging. nothing is labeled, colors are often hard to differentiate, and no key is provided. the companion website does promise a “legend for movie s1,” but provides only a brief caption: “movie showing the expansion of the indo-european languages through time. contours on the map represent the 95% highest posterior density distribution of the range of indo-european.” one must thus infer what the lines represent based on the supplementary text and on the manner in which different segments lengthen and divide in particular places as time proceeds. each line represents a branch of the indo-european language family. those that appear early in the animation indicate the deepest divisions, while those that emerge later represent the shallower

Article 8 - the geography of ‘book’
the geography of ‘book’ % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the spatial distribution of words for a given meaning can reveal interesting patterns of both language spread and language contact. while both factors are always at play, language contact is more evident in regard to words for cultural innovations, such as ‘tea’ or ‘computer’. another interesting case is the geography of words for ‘book’, which many languages borrowed along with the general concept of ‘book’ and more often than not with one particularly important religious text. this post is from geocurrents geocurrents.info provides map-illustrated analyses of current events, delving into the often overlooked geographic and cultural contexts that shape these world developments. led by stanford university senior lecturer martin w. lewis and linguist asya pereltsvaig. source: http://geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/linguistic-geography/the-geography-of-book

Article 1 - what we all spoke when the world was young
but one scholar in particular, dr. joseph h. greenberg of stanford university, has defied this ardent pessimism. in the course of a long career, he has classified most of the world's languages into just a handful of major groups. though it remains unclear how these superfamilies may be related to one another, he has identified words and concepts that seem common to them all and could be echoes of a mother tongue. and this month, at the age of 84, dr. greenberg is publishing the first of two volumes on eurasiatic, his proposed superfamily that includes a swath of languages spoken from portugal to japan. like the biologist e. o. wilson, dr. greenberg is that rare breed of academic, a synthesizer who derives patterns from the work of many specialists, an exercise the specialists do not always welcome. but though biologists came to acknowledge the pioneering value of dr. wilson's work, linguists have reached no such consensus on that of dr. greenberg. will he one day be recognized as having done for language what linnaeus did for biology, as his stanford colleague and associate dr. merritt ruhlen believes, or is his work more fit, as one critic has urged, to be ''shouted down''? dr. greenberg is by no means an outcast from his profession. he is one of the very few linguists who are members of the national academy of sciences,

Article 2 - language arrogance
to the editor: “languages die, but not their last words” (news article, sept. 19) seems to jump uncritically on the “endangered languages” bandwagon. opening with an alarmist prediction about the rate of global language disappearance, it closes by citing a misleading parallel made by linguistic researchers between languages and biological species. scholars who promote these arguments often have a narrow view of language change, overlooking the emergence of new languages and the dramatic changes that habitually occur within existing languages. i cringe at the thought of western scientists and activists descending upon indigenous (indigent) populations around the world to preserve botanical knowledge for the sake of “science” (a code word for western pharmacology) and to impose their view of linguistic and cultural diversity in an effort to persuade the speakers of disappearing languages to reverse their choices about which language best serves their socioeconomic needs. josef horacek athens, ga., sept. 19, 2007

when mr. adrià reached into a bin of live shrimp and asked to buy exactly 12, a worker barked: “by pound! no one-by-one.” mr. adrià smiled, pulled his hand back, and rolled with it. he bought large and small scallops, a red snapper and a striped bass pulled live from a tank and filleted while we waited. “it’s very important to get other people working for you,” he said. “make your life easier.” i had thought i might need to visit a laboratory supply shop to buy a bunsen burner or some sort of butter atomizer to prepare for mr. adrià’s visit. he is famous for his foams, pearls and infusions made using syringes, liquid nitrogen and alginates. but i was told mr. adrià uses his fancy cooking techniques only at el bulli and in his barcelona laboratory. “he will be cooking in the traditional way,” his publicist said. with no particular menu in mind, mr. adrià sought what was available. he said it typically took him about 10 minutes to shop for himself and his wife at home in barcelona. but on the lower east side, he continued to meet resistance. he pointed to a bucket of live frogs and asked the shop’s proprietor to skin them. “no, no, no, no, no,” the shopkeeper said, wrinkling his nose. “too messy.” after

Article 5 - watch out barney! here comes zebby.
even by their mother. there was karen wahl, 56, on the stage at the nassau county fair in uniondale recently, dressed in a zebby the zebra costume, dancing her way across the stage. from across the midway, by stroller and on foot, came the toddler and kindergarten set, gathering at the foot of the stage to sing and dance along with the zebra. ''do the zebby, do the zebby. . . .'' blared from the speakers. while zebby and a friend, the lazy lion, hoofed, tim wahl pulled out a table laden with zebby t-shirts, audio and video cassettes and beanie-baby knockoffs of zebby. merchandising, after all, is what ''zebby's zoo'' is all about. the children's entertainment program started with online sales of music cassettes. the characters weren't brought to life until the wahls created the television show. by then, thousand of videos, cassettes and stuffed animals had been sold. ''a tv show is developed and promoted and if it is successful, they go to the next step, which is licensing or manufacturing the merchandise,'' tim wahl said. ''we went exactly the opposite way. we didn't do it that way by accident. that was our objective. we knew from the beginning that we didn't have the experience in the tv industry and we didn't

Article 6 - in simple pronouns, clues to shifting latino identity
''when you think that the united states is the fifth largest spanish-speaking nation in the world and new york has more spanish speakers than 13 latin american capitals, you begin to appreciate the dimensions of the linguistic and cultural hybridity that's taking place.'' oddly enough, what the researchers are studying is a linguistic feature that may look insignificant at first glance: the use or nonuse of subject pronouns. but it is one of those tiny details in science, like the finch's beak in the study of evolution, that occasionally illuminate something profound. the use of subject pronouns in spanish has long been of interest to linguists. (there is an entire book on so-called subject expression among spanish speakers in madrid.) in english, the subject of a sentence is always expressed; in spanish it can be, and often is, left out. for example, where an english speaker would say ''we sing,'' a spanish speaker could say either ''nosotros cantamos'' or simply ''cantamos.'' linguists say spanish speakers from the caribbean tend to use a lot of pronouns; people from central and south american countries use them less. ''what makes new york city interesting, and why we grabbed this issue, is that new york contains people from areas that differ with respect to this feature,'' said ricardo otheguy, a professor of linguistics at the graduate center of the city university of new york and a researcher on the project. ''it's interesting to compare puerto ricans

Article 7 - the retreat of the tongue of the czars
the kremlin has tried to halt the decline by setting up foundations to promote the study of russian abroad and by castigating neighbors who shove the language from public life. in some nations, a backlash against russian has stirred its own backlash in the language’s defense. still, the challenge is considerable. at stake is more than just words on a page. language imparts power and influence, binding the colonized to the colonizers and, for better or worse, altering how native populations interact with the world. long after they gave up their territories, britain and france and spain have retained a certain authority in far-flung outposts because of the languages that they seeded. czars and soviet leaders spread russian in the lands that they conquered, using it as a kind of glue to unite disparate nationalities, a so-called second mother tongue, and connect them to their rulers. that legacy endures today, as exemplified by the close relationship between russia and germany, which stems in part from chancellor angela merkel’s ability to speak russian. she learned it growing up in communist east germany. but with the language in retreat, there are unlikely to be many future angela merkels. for the kremlin, could there be a more bitter reminder of how history has turned than the sight of young estonians or georgians or uzbeks (not to mention czechs or hungarians) flocking to classes in english instead of russian? “the

Article 8 - irish tongues are wagging in u.s. classrooms
in some ways, ireland is catching up. of the 51 universities outside ireland that teach irish, 29 are in the united states. the fulbright program has sponsored foreign language teaching assistants to work and study at american universities since 1968. those modest one-year fellowships have generally gone to teachers of perennially popular languages, like spanish and french, and more recently are going to languages like arabic, hindi, turkish and urdu. still, a language that has few practical applications besides deciphering road signs in connemara and reading old irish literature is a less obvious choice. slightly more than half of irish language students at notre dame are descendants of irish immigrants, a result of what christopher fox, director of the university's keough institute for irish studies, called ""the third-generation effect."" societal bias meant that earlier generations ""couldn't be ethnic in america,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""now it's o.k., and they want to connect."" mr. fox added, ""the irish language is seen as one way of doing that."" but gaelic also appeals to students who are interested in linguistics, the preservation of indigenous cultures, or the role languages play in international politics, mr. fox and other university professors said. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

Content: mismodeling indo-european origin and expansion: bouckaert, atkinson, wade and the assault on historical linguistics (before it's news) dear readers, as geocurrents passed through its august slowdown, plans were made for a series on the summer olympics. thanks to the efforts of chris kremer, we have gathered statistics—and made maps—relating olympic medal count by country to population and gdp, both overall and in regard to specific categories of competition. the series, however, has been put on hold by the recent publication of two heralded articles on the history and geography of the indo-european language family. on august 24, a short piece in science—“mapping the origins and expansion of the indo-european language family”—made extravagant claims, purporting to overturn the most influential historical-linguistic account of the world’s most widespread language family. on the same day, nicholas wade, noted new york times science reporter, wrote a half-page spread in the news section of the times on the science report, entitled “family tree of languages has roots in anatolia, biologists say.” over the next few days, the story was picked up—and often twisted in the process—by assorted journalists. within a few days, headlines appeared as preposterous as “english language originated in turkey.” as wade’s title indicates, the science article, written by remco bouckaert and eight others (most notably quentin d. atkinson), seeks to overturn the thesis that the indo-european (i-e) family originated north of the black and caspian seas. it instead locates the i-e heartland in what is now turkey, supporting the “anatolian” thesis advanced a generation ago by archeologist colin renfrew. the science team bases its claims on mathematical grounds, using techniques derived from evolutionary biology and epidemiology to draw linguistic family trees and model the geographical spread of language groups. according to wade, the authors claim that their study does nothing less than “solve” a “long-standing problem in archaeology: the origin of the indo-european family of languages.” (strictly speaking, however, the problem is not an archaeological one, as excavations by themselves tell us nothing about the languages of non-literate peoples; it is rather a linguistic problem with major bearing on prehistory more generally.) as geocurrents is deeply interested in the intersection of language, geography, and history, the two articles immediately grabbed our attention. our initial response was one of profound skepticism, as it hardly seemed likely that a single mathematical study could “solve” one of the most carefully examined conundrums of the distant human past. recent work in both linguistics and archeology, moreover, has tended against the anatolian hypothesis, placing indo-european origins in the steppe and parkland zone of what is now ukraine,

updated: nexus 4: good or bad deal? (before it's news) expansion of the previous nexus 4 article here on october 29, 2012, google announced their newest flagship phone – the nexus 4. i can probably tell what you’re thinking – it’s just another android phone. with a new phone releasing nearly every month, it’s easy to write off this phone as a “typical android device”. but this phone isn’t one of those – it’s a nexus device. suprisingly, google opted to use lg as the manufacturer for their nexus 4 device, instead of samsung for their previous 2 nexus phones. it appears here that google may want to expand the android ecosystem, and not have to rely as samsung as the face of all android devices. if you didn’t know what the google nexus series of devices are, they’re devices designed by google, but manufactured by companies ranging from asus, htc, lg, and samsung. that’s not anything too special right? each of the companies listed produce their own android device, but what makes the nexus devices special? well, nexus devices usually are released to “launch” a new version of android, in the case of the nexus 4, android 4.2 jellybean. they also typically receive their updates first, mainly because they run android, without any company’s ui (for example: htc sense) added on top. let’s first introduce android 4.

Article 4 - cross platform: the future of mobile app development

Article 1 - microsoft surface phone rumors and news leaks
subscribe on youtube it seemed inevitable that microsoft would create a surface phone — not an official name — after it acquired nokia. in fact, there was talk long before that too , but microsoft has often denied those rumors and stuck with producing new lumia phones. however, rumors and leaks regarding such a device have continued, suggesting it’s something the company may still be considering. here’s everything we think we know about microsoft’s surface phone project. microsoft may wait until late 2017 to release surface phone after the surface phone failed to make an appearance at microsoft’s 2016 build conference , two reports from windows central quoting sources close to the matter, said microsoft could wait until early 2017 to release the new device. the site’s late april report states april 2017 is the current target for the new smartphone. the first report said that instead of one surface phone, microsoft could release three models. early plans for the surface phone release allegedly suggest that there will be a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, or a high-spec version for tech geeks. details about possible specs for the devices or what the difference will be between the three models have yet to be released. the rumored timing of the surface phone has recently been pushed out to late 2017 . this follows statements by microsoft ceo satya nadella in november 2016 that provides a tiny bit of clarification to microsoft’s official position on smartphones. specifically, nadella

Article 2 - for digital artists, apps provide new palette
but the advent of mobile devices with touch screens and tilt sensors changed all that. beginning last january, mr. snibbe dusted off some of his old code and got to work. he has since released three mobile applications — bubble harp, antograph and gravilux — and has become one of the first artists to make it big in the itunes app store. all told, his three apps have been downloaded over 400,000 times. the majority of those downloads, though, came when he released gravilux without charge; eventually, he set the price at 99 cents per download for the iphone version of gravilux and antograph, with bubble harp and the ipad gravilux retailing for $1.99. he would not say how much he had made, save to allow that he covered the “significant” start-up costs. his gravilux application — an elegant, black and white field of dots that follows the user’s finger around the screen — was released in may. in 24 hours it soared to the top of the app charts. apple selected gravilux to be a featured app, a coveted slot. mr. snibbe’s apps resemble interactive screen savers, with mesmerizing patterns that respond to touch. he has more on the way this fall and winter. while artist-made apps make up only a sliver of the 225,000 apps in the itunes store, the field is growing, with some well

Article 4 - an android phone that says ‘google’
the back panel camera has an led flash, but the quality is only average and it can’t take hi-def videos. the low-resolution front-facing camera is intended for video calls or checking for spinach in your teeth. (the software for video calling doesn’t come with the phone, although you can download a couple of somewhat flaky apps for this purpose from the android app store online.) the 4-inch screen is bright, sharp and vivid. the case is all plastic, which makes it more of a scratch-and-fingerprint magnet than the glass-and-metal iphone. it’s sleek but fairly generic-looking; the only design eccentricity is a bulge on the lower back that, you could argue, helps you orient the phone when extracting it from your pocket. photo samsung also claims that the screen is slightly bowed inward — curved — to fit your face better. really? you’d need a microscope to measure it; the curve is virtually undetectable. if this minute degree of curvature fits your head, well, you must have a cranium the size of a hot-air balloon. the s lacks a couple of features of the original nexus, like dual microphones for sound cancellation (doesn’t matter — the s sounds great), the trackball that doubled as a message-indicator light, and the memory card slot. this time around, your storage is capped at 16 gigabytes — only 1 gig of which is available for storing standard downloaded apps. technically, the phone is sold “un

Article 6 - google enters the wireless world
“we’re human beings and we communicate, and that’s what the internet social network phenomenon is all about,” said robert pepper, a former policy chief at the federal communications commission . “the internet is going mobile, and it’s not just top down, its one-to-one and many-to-many all at the same time, and that’s what the google guys get.” with the move, google is trying to alter the dynamics of yet another industry. it is already using its deep pockets and innovative technology to shake up television, book publishing, computer software and advertising. but while google’s much-anticipated plan has encouraged talk of a google phone, the company said that for now it had no plans to build phones. instead, it has signed up powerful partners to develop and market the phones, including handset makers like motorola and samsung, carriers like t-mobile, sprint and china mobile and semiconductor companies like qualcomm and intel . the group, the open handset alliance, expects to start selling the google-powered phones in the second half of next year. analysts were quick to point out that impressive telecommunications and computing alliances had been proposed many times in recent decades and had often had little impact. and the alliance’s software, which is not yet complete, would face competition from established rivals, like microsoft , nokia , palm and research in motion . “i’m not convinced,” said chetan sharma, a technology consultant who tracks the wireless data industry. “it’s a pretty impressive list of people in

Article 7 - intel adopts an identity in software
for example, moblin fires up and reaches the internet in about seven seconds, then displays a novel type of start-up screen. people will find their appointments listed on one side of the screen, along with their favorite programs. but the bulk of the screen is taken up by cartoonish icons that show things like social networking updates from friends, photos and recently used documents. with animated icons and other quirky bits and pieces, moblin looks like a fresh take on the operating system. some companies hope it will give microsoft a strong challenge in the market for the small, cheap laptops commonly known as netbooks. a polished second version of the software, which is in trials, should start appearing on a variety of netbooks this summer. “we really view this as an opportunity and a game changer,” said ronald w. hovsepian, the chief executive of novell, which plans to offer a customized version on moblin to computer makers. novell views moblin as a way to extend its business selling software and services related to linux. while moblin fits netbooks well today, it was built with smartphones in mind. those smartphones explain why intel was willing to needle microsoft. photo intel has previously tried and failed to carve out a prominent stake in the market for chips used in smaller computing devices like phones. but the company says one of its newer chips, called atom, will solve this riddle and help it compete against the likes of texas instruments and qualcomm. the low-power,

“we’ve seen quite a huge growth of android in the enterprise over the last 18 months,” said nick mcquire, research director of enterprise mobility strategies at the international data corporation. “we see it as being neck and neck with apple to be a top mobile enterprise platform in europe.” photo rim’s answer to the increasing popularity of android handsets and the iphone is a new version of the blackberry software, called blackberry 10. but phones based on the new software system have been delayed several times and are now not expected until late 2012. thorsten heins, the company’s new chief executive, said the new software would address the “consumerization of i.t.,” referring to the growing trend of businesses letting their employees choose which devices they bring to work. mr. heins believes that rim’s advantage in the business market remains the company’s focus on security. he said that rim regularly speaks to chief information officers, who say they do not like that android devices and iphones have become prominent in the work place. “they are in a pickle. their pickle is security,” mr. heins said in an interview. “when the first big security flaw even happens in one of the large enterprises, you will see this turn around. wait for the day this happens.” but waiting is not something people in businesses are doing. i.d.c. recently surveyed business managers and information technology managers at 728 businesses across seven western european countries and found that android was the

Deutsche Bank is facing a liquidity crisis, with its stock price falling to record lows after the US Department of Justice announced a potential $14 billion settlement related to mortgage-backed securities. Analysts warn that the bank may be on the verge of a ""liquidity event"" similar to the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse.

JP Morgan's trading loss is reportedly getting bigger, with losses potentially exceeding $9 billion. The bank has been rapidly unwinding its positions, and internal models project significant losses.

Central banks are accused of propping up stock markets through massive buybacks, with investors pulling $133 billion from global equity funds so far this year. Retail investors are being encouraged to buy stocks while the top 1% sell their equities at record highs.

global bankster mafia caught rigging markets to destroy middle class headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! christina sarich, staff waking times billion dollar lawsuits are nothing to gold-rigging banks like deutsche, but the proposition of spending time in jail might just have motivated the notorious criminal institution’s executives to rat on its peers. this is just the beginning of disclosure in the financial industry which the world has never before seen. deutsche was fined just over $2.5 billion barely a year ago for rigging interest rates, and now they are admitting in settled u.s. lawsuits this week that they manipulation gold and silver prices on international markets. part of the settlement involved the naming of co-conspirators in the manipulation of these markets. the scam is being called ‘the london gold fix’, and in addition to deutsche bank, canada’s bank of nova scotia, the u.k.’s barclays and hsbc, and france’s société générale are involved. more than likely hundreds of banks participated in illegally setting prices for gold and silver – but this isn’t really news to those familiar with the ministrations of the elite banking cabal. cushy banking jobs are only given to those deemed worthy by the ‘four horsemen’ of banking who are among the top ten stock holders of practically every fortune 500 company and who come from only eight families. according to global finance magazine the world’s five biggest banks are all based in rothschild

Article 4 - jp morgan trading loss getting bigger
jp morgan trading loss getting bigger % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) editor’s note: first $$2 billion, now $$9 billion.. chances are we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg. losses on jpmorgan chase’s bungled trade could total as much as $$9 billion, far exceeding earlier public estimates, according to people who have been briefed on the situation. when jamie dimon, the bank’s chief executive, announced in may that the bank had lost $$2 billion in a bet on credit derivatives, he estimated that losses could double within the next few quarters. but the red ink has been mounting in recent weeks, as the bank has been unwinding its positions, according to interviews with current and former traders and executives at the bank who asked not to be named because of investigations into the bank. the bank’s exit from its money-losing trade is happening faster than many expected. jpmorgan previously said it hoped to clear its position by early next year; now it is already out of more than half of the trade and may be completely free this year. as jpmorgan has moved rapidly to unwind the position — its most volatile assets in particular — internal models at the bank have recently projected losses of as much as $$9 billion. in april, the bank generated an internal report that showed that the losses, assuming worst-case conditions, could reach $$8 billion to $$9 billion, according to

Article 7 - it’s great to be a banker!

Article 8 - barclays makes £500m betting on food crisis
(before it's news) barclays has made as much as half a billion pounds in two years from speculating on food staples such as wheat and soya, prompting allegations that banks are profiting handsomely from the global food crisis. barclays is the uk bank with the greatest involvement in food commodity trading and is one of the three biggest global players, along with the us banking giants goldman sachs and morgan stanley, research from the world development movement points out. last week the trading giant glencore was attacked for describing the global food crisis and price rises as a “good” business opportunity. the extent of barclays’ involvement in food speculation comes to light as new figures from the world bank show that global food prices hit an all-time high in july, with poor harvests in the us and russia pushing up the average worldwide cost of staples by an unprecedented 10 per cent in a month. read more here: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/barclays-makes-500m-betting-on-food-crisis-8100011.html

share by anna irrera and jemima kelly new york/london nov 25 (reuters) - banks involved in the blockchain consortium r3 cev have expressed interest in investing $59 million in the company's first funding round, less than half its overall target, a person close to the deal said on friday. r3, a new york-based startup, is seeking to raise $150 million from its members and strategic investors to fund its activities focused on developing blockchain-based technology for the financial services sector. it had originally sought to raise $200 million, offering prospective investors a 90 percent stake in a new entity it would have run but restructured the deal to $150 million in return for a 60 percent stake in itself. it has invited its original 42 bank members to invest first and will subsequently reach out to the other roughly 30 banks it works with as well as external companies, the person said. it plans to raise the overall amount over the next nine to 12 months. of those original members, 36 have expressed indications of interest through stakes ranging from $3.5 million to $1 million each, the person said, declining to be named because the fundraising is private. goldman sachs group inc, morgan stanley, banco santander sa and national bank of australia have opted out of the fund-raising and are planning to leave the consortium, reuters reported on monday. jp morgan chase & co has not yet made a commitment

Article 4 - banks to the rescue; many think the time is ripe to lure savers
and some banks are even harking back to the age when consumers got toasters for opening new accounts. (these days, you're more likely to get a cellular phone.) it is too early to tell if banks' efforts are paying off. but in the first quarter, deposits at banks grew about 10 percent from the period a year earlier, according to an analysis of federal reserve data by credit suisse first boston. that is a healthy gain given the slowing in the economy and the fact that the first quarter is usually when people withdraw money to pay taxes or cover bills left from christmas, said susan roth, a banking analyst at credit suisse. during the first quarter of 2000 deposits grew only about 6 percent from the prior year. many analysts and consultants say the bank marketing push is long overdue after more than a decade of indifference toward the deposit business. in recent years, it seemed banks were promoting almost anything but savings accounts, as they hawked mutual funds and online trading. in fact, banks took savings customers so much for granted that the rate on the average statement savings account dropped much faster than interest rates in general, from 5.22 percent in 1990 to 1.58 percent last month, according to bankrate.com.

Article 5 - bank widens offer to repay fund holders amid inquiry
the bank is at the center of a growing group of companies scrambling to head off any actions by regulators in their widening inquiry into mutual fund trading. last week alone, alliance capital management suspended two employees for their role in fund trading, and fred alger management, another investment firm, suspended three executives. prudential securities fired 12 brokers and managers for their role in questionable fund trading, and merrill lynch fired three senior brokers. many other fund companies have said that they are responding to requests for information from regulators. yesterday, franklin resources, parent company of the franklin, templeton and mutual series funds, confirmed that it had received a subpoena from the attorney general's office. ''this request for information in no way implies any wrongdoing,'' the company said in a statement on its web site. franklin prohibits what is known as late trading, that is trading in fund shares after the market close at prices based on the value of the shares at 4 p.m. it also has restrictions on market timing, or rapid trading of shares in mutual funds. such practices are being investigated by regulators, who have called them widespread. bank of america said yesterday that it would refund any money lost by investors at other fund companies whose shares were improperly traded by canary, as well as holders of its nations funds, assuming they were not already reimbursed by canary or other third parties. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Article 6 - r.b.s. to further reduce stake in citizens financial group
photo london — the royal bank of scotland said on tuesday that it intended to further reduce its stake in the citizens financial group, the american retail bank it spun off in an initial public offering last year. r.b.s., which is based in edinburgh, said it planned to sell 75 million shares of the american bank, equivalent to a 14 percent stake. it could also sell an overallotment of 11.25 million shares, the bank said in a news release. if the overallotment is fully exercised, r.b.s. would retain a 24.7 percent stake. r.b.s. has a 40.8 percent stake in the bank. r.b.s. also said that citizens financial intended to rebuy a further $250 million in stock at the offering price in a directed buy back. advertisement continue reading the main story shares of citizens financial closed down less than 1 percent at $25.94 in new york on monday. it would signal the second major sale by r.b.s. this year as it looks to reduce its holdings in citizens financial. r.b.s. has said it plans to fully exit the american bank by the end of 2016.

Article 7 - doubts persist as most europe banks pass stress tests
markets reacted to the test results with muted enthusiasm. european and united states stock indexes generally rose less than 1 percent, though bank shares were down. the euro rose early but finished down less than a hundredth of a percentage point against the dollar. but, as with similar tests of banks in the united states last year, it may take days or weeks to determine whether the tests will end banks’ mistrust of one another’s creditworthiness and encourage interbank lending, which is crucial to the normal functioning of the financial system and ultimately the overall economy. some economists said the tests excluded certain possibilities, like the effect of a debt default by greece or another european country, calling into question its credibility. “the overall result seems out of line with the tensions we have been observing in the financial system in the last few months,” said marco annunziata, chief economist at unicredit group, based in milan. “the tests are unlikely to reassure the market that transparency has been re-established or that pockets of weakness are being rapidly addressed.” european policy makers said they refused to consider the potential effect of sovereign defaults because they would never allow them to happen. photo in a compromise, banks were scheduled to detail their holdings of greek, spanish, portuguese and other sovereign bonds. but a report released by the european bank supervisors did not contain that information, which would resolve intense speculation about which banks were most exposed. “investors cannot reverse-engineer the results and apply their own

Content: wilbur ross’s firm exits u.k.’s virgin money with stake sale (2) donal griffin and ruth david nov 17, 2016 6:55 am et (bloomberg) -- wl ross & co., the investment firm managed by billionaire wilbur ross, raised 171.5 million pounds ($214 million) by selling its remaining 12 percent stake in virgin money holdings uk plc. shares in the british challenger bank fell the most in four months. the new york-based money manager doubled the size of the stake it had originally planned to sell to about 54 million shares at 320 pence apiece after strong demand from investors, according to a statement on thursday. virgin money, a lender started by fellow billionaire richard branson, was down 6.3 percent to 317.3 pence at 11:22 a.m. in london trading. the company, led by chief executive officer jayne-anne gadhia, is among the u.k.’s so-called challenger banks backed by hedge- and private-equity funds that have emerged since the financial crisis. ross, who scoured europe for finance assets after the crash, agreed to buy a stake in the bank for 100 million pounds in 2010. “while this may therefore satisfy some of that demand in the short-term, the share price will ultimately be determined by the fundamental outlook for the group, which we think is supportive of a higher valuation,” gary greenwood, an analyst at shore capital with a buy rating on the shares. bank of america corp. and goldman sachs group inc. sold the shares on behalf of ross’s firm, according to the statement. ross and simon hall, a spokesman for virgin money, didn’t comment. ross, who committed more funds to virgin money after his first purchase, began selling his firm’s stake with the lender’s 2014 initial public offering. sales included 45 million shares in april 2015 at 400 pence each for 180 million pounds, and then 50 million shares at 405 pence apiece for 203 million pounds five months later. virgin money’s earnings next year will be reduced by bond repayments and new expenditure, while mortgage interest rates have fallen since may, ian gordon, an analyst in london with investec plc, wrote in a note to clients. these are reasons for “slight caution,” wrote gordon, who has a hold rating on the shares. the stock has declined 17 percent this year, though has recovered 15 percent since since being hurt by britain’s vote to leave the european union. ross also invested in lenders in ireland, cyprus and greece after the crash. in 2014, he sold his stake in dublin-based bank of ireland plc for a profit of about 500 million euros ($535 million). ross is u.s. president-elect

military junta stabs turkey in the back (before it's news) recep tayyip erdoğan’s figure has become one of the most talked about and damnable both among the west and allies of russia after the shooting down a russian fighter jet incident. at various internet resources i’ve read loads of flame that would be enough to try this man as an instigator, a traitor of his nato allies’ interests, his son’s aider and abettor in isis oil reselling, a smuggler supplying arms for daesh terrorists, and a dictator pressing for the new ottoman caliphate. you must admit that all those features add up to an extremely unflattening hitler-like epic character. it is unlikely that someone would elect this person as their president. meanwhile before his presidency erdoğan had been prime minister of turkey for eleven and a half years. i think that turks had got enough chances to apprehend him as a politician and a leader. that is why they granted the majority of their voices for him and his party. however since the mid of 2013 erdoğan has been dogged by political scandals. the taksim square protests were the first fruits. it looked suspiciously similar in organization to the previous arab spring wave, which struck mena countries in 2010-2013. incidents “with the involvement of the head of state” started to mushroom before the 2014 presidential

Article 1 - real men of genius
in 1960, herman kahn, a fellow at the rand corporation in santa monica and a model for the character dr. strangelove, published a book, “on thermonuclear war,” in which he made the case for limited nuclear war by way of championing civil defense. the effects of radioactive fallout, he argued, were grossly exaggerated. americans could hide in backyard shelters, deep caverns and fortified mine shafts. kahn further suggested that food might be labeled according to its contamination level, with the degree expressed in five different grades; grade d food would thus be restricted to people over 40 or 50, and e would be for animals. kahn’s colleagues weren’t amused. “burn it” was the lapidary verdict of his chum and rival albert wohlstetter, when he saw the tome in manuscript form. perhaps wohlstetter, a gourmand and oenophile, was most enraged by the suggestion that grade d would be acceptable fare. other aggrieved rand scholars felt the book trivialized their sophisticated theories about nuclear warfare. but as alex abella suggests in “soldiers of reason,” an entertaining and fast-paced account of the rand corporation, kahn ended up inadvertently capturing something essential about the madcap think-tank world of the defense intellectuals, which was permeated with jargon like “n + 1” and “counter­force first strike.” rand, which pravda called “the

Article 2 - paperback row
call me by your name, by andré aciman. (picador, $14.) in this first novel of adolescent sexual awakening, the precocious 17-year-old son of a wealthy academic falls for an older male graduate student who has come to his father’s well-appointed home on the italian riviera. the student is there to revise a manuscript, which, since this is a novel about time and love, is on heraclitus. stacey d’erasmo, our reviewer, called it “an exceptionally beautiful book ... as much a story of paradise found as it is of paradise lost.” lose your mother: a journey along the atlantic slave route, by saidiya hartman. (farrar, straus & giroux, $14.) hartman, a professor of english and comparative literature at columbia, traveled to ghana to try to understand the experience of people who were sold into slavery. “in following the trail of captives from the hinterland to the atlantic coast, i intended to retrace the process by which lives were destroyed and slaves born,” hartman writes. the result is a thought-provoking meditation on slavery’s legacy. wish i could be there: notes from a phobic life, by allen shawn. (penguin, $15.) in this quirky memoir, shawn, a composer who teaches at bennington college, describes life with so many debilitating phobias that a list of them “might stretch all

Article 3 - soviet dreams
a superstitious tradition, meant to protect children from vengeful spirits, persists in spanish-­speaking countries — naming babies for the opposite qualities that benevolent parents might be expected to wish upon their offspring. parents who want their daughters to lead joyful lives might name them dolores (“sorrows,” “pain”) or soledad (“loneliness”). a boy might be called tristán (“the sad one”). but andrey platonov, the beleaguered soviet writer who died in 1951 of tuberculosis (contracted from his son, who had been infected in stalin’s gulag), seems to have pursued the reverse strategy when, in the mid-1930s, he began work on an allegorical novella entitled “happy moscow,” to see whether it was “objectively impossible” to write a bona fide “soviet” work of fiction. russians, of course, are superstitious in their own way. whistle indoors, shake hands across a threshold or, if you’re female, sit on the grass, and you’ll soon discover your error. but in naming, russians tend to follow a practice of literalness and optimism — as any babushka called traktorina or lenina, any woman called lyubov (“love”), any man known as boris (“fighter for glory”) can attest. but “happy moscow” didn’t meet with a happy fate when platonov gave

Article 4 - the departed
well, hold on to your hats. “2666” is the permanently mysterious title of a bolaño manuscript rescued from his desk after his passing, the primary effort of the last five years of his life. the book was published posthumously in spanish in 2004 to tremendous acclaim, after what appears to have been a bit of dithering over bolaño’s final intentions — a small result of which is that its english translation (by natasha wimmer, the indefatigable translator of “the savage detectives”) has been bracketed by two faintly defensive statements justifying the book’s present form. they needn’t have bothered. “2666” is as consummate a performance as any 900-page novel dare hope to be: bolaño won the race to the finish line in writing what he plainly intended, in his self-interrogating way, as a master statement. indeed, he produced not only a supreme capstone to his own vaulting ambition, but a landmark in what’s possible for the novel as a form in our increasingly, and terrifyingly, post-national world. “the savage detectives” looks positively hermetic beside it. “2666” consists of five sections, each with autonomous life and form; in fact, bolaño evidently flirted with the notion of separate publication for the five parts. indeed, two or three of these might be the equal of his masterpieces at novella length, “by night in chile” and “

Article 5 - invisible designs
it’s a death out of his own fiction, with the grave absurdity of his greatest novels — “i served the king of england” (1971); “too loud a solitude” (1976); “closely watched trains” (1964), made into an oscar-winning film in 1966 — that mournful laughter in the dark. he once said his comic sensibility was shaped by a warning on a dry cleaner’s receipt: “some stains can be removed only by the destruction of the material itself.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story book review newsletter sign up to receive a preview of each sunday’s book review, delivered to your inbox every friday. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. today hrabal is revered, if rarely read outside his homeland. but a book of his has recently been translated into english for the first time by paul wilson, a violent and merry collection of stories from the 1950s called mr. kafka and other tales from the time of the cult (new directions, paper, $14.95). it’s a slender book, perhaps his bleakest, and a reminder that we ignore hrabal

Article 6 - professor scarry has a theory
it was an unlikely forum for a scientific expose. to make sure the authorities didn't miss her dense, 20,000-word essay -- sandwiched between a review of a book on 18th-century culture and an exchange on northern ireland -- she sent a copy to james hall, chairman of the national transportation safety board. the agency eventually allocated several hundred thousand dollars for fresh research into emi. what's more, scarry's work was cited on the first page of a nasa study of emi commissioned by t.w.a. 800 investigators. these were remarkable coups for an english professor who had no formal training in aviation science and who had never been near a crash site. anyone else might have stopped there, but scarry wasn't through. this fall, she published two more articles in the new york review, expanding her emi hypothesis to include swissair flight 111, which went down near nova scotia after an electrical fire in september 1998, and egyptair flight 990, whose fatal plunge into the atlantic near nantucket last october was caused, many experts believe, by a co-pilot on a suicide mission. as an explanation for any of these plane crashes -- let alone all three -- scarry's theory is generally considered extremely unlikely. (ultimately, the n.t.s.b. ruled out emi as a factor in the t.w.a. disaster.) but more interesting than whether she turns out to be right

Article 7 - now he’s only hunted by cameras
of course it’s been years since mr. rushdie was just another writer. he was hurled into global and religious politics when his novel “the satanic verses” prompted the ayatollah khomeini to lay a death sentence on his head in 1989. a nightmarish underground life enveloped him for nearly 10 years, until iran withdrew its support of the fatwa. the subterranean existence was then followed by a paparazzi-filled one, during which he left his third wife and a son for padma lakshmi, an indian-born model, 23 years his junior, who currently hosts the reality show “top chef.” last june, when queen elizabeth knighted him, many of the issues that have dogged mr. rushdie over the past 20 years were freshly aroused, not only among muslims around the world but also among political kin contemptuous that an avowed leftist would accept such an imperial honor, and conservatives who lashed out at him because they believed he was once again endangering britain’s security. “i was quite hurt and shocked by the assaults on me,” mr. rushdie said, his pyramid-shaped eyebrows and heavy eyelids distinctive even behind a pair of thin rectangular frames. “i do not understand the animus.” then, a few weeks later, he announced that ms. lakshmi was leaving him. now if mr. rushdie happens to be spotted having a drink with an attractive woman

Article 8 - where is cuba going?
because my wife and her family have living relatives in cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from miami. the legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. but you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. i first tagged along 12 years ago. it’s hands down the strangest way to travel to cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it’s the simplest. but the airport bureaucracy in miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. that first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. i spoke hardly any spanish then. my wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about havana and messages for various people in their town. now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that i took to mean, “words aren’t necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,” but that when i think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, “you, simpleton.” one line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. a couple of

Title: riddle wrapped in a mystery
Content: it’s a spooky feeling, if you’re a translator who loves bicycling and word games and likes traveling to russia, to open a book and encounter, in the very first chapter, a translating, cycling crossword fanatic who is plucked from a kaliningrad beach by a homburg-hatted butcher, hurled into a carcass-strewn meat van and never heard from again. (note to self: avoid kaliningrad.) at the time he was nabbed, the translator was carrying a notebook he’d used at a session of multilingual, high-stakes business negotiations. his abductor, flipping through the pages, was infuriated to find them filled with illegible doodles — stars, bugs, cats and spirals — the translator’s own private code. “let the birds read it,” the butcher declared, flinging the notebook into the wind. local children later found it in the sea grass. could this collection of rebuses hold the key to the deaths of a muckraking journalist, tatiana petrovna, and a slimy oligarch, grisha grigorenko, in moscow, 700 miles away? what else might it conceal? the reporter bought the notebook from the kids in kaliningrad just before she died. might it, therefore, be dangerous to attempt to decode it? in “tatiana,” his eighth crime novel dominated by the lawless landmass once known as the soviet union, martin cruz smith sets his slavic sleuth, arkady renko, on the case. like his fellow thriller writer, the late tom clancy, smith hasn’t let the end of the cold war deter him from raking the formerly evil empire for bloodcurdling tales of suspense and intrigue. even after the u.s.s.r. ceased to exist, both authors kept a cool war nicely chilled, piling ice on the corpus delicti to keep the frisson intact. while both men have written of submarines, suicides, murders and mayhem, soldiers and statesmen, and the machinations of the k.g.b., f.s.b. and c.i.a., smith has always had a lighter, more emotional touch. the main event of a tom clancy novel is always its precise, technically detailed plotting, but it’s the human factor that takes center stage for martin cruz smith. his protagonist, arkady renko, senior investigator for very important cases in the moscow prosecutor’s office, is a hangdog, underdog hero — romantic in a diffident, chain-smoking way, like rick blaine in “casablanca.” unlucky in love, mistrusted by the higher-ups, renko has a soft spot for outcasts (he’s the guardian of a surly teenage chess hustler named zhenya) and a conscience that goads him to put himself at risk to serve truth, justice and the arkady renko way of life. photo early in “

The article cites specific data from the ILO report, such as the estimated $99 billion generated by commercial sexual exploitation annually. There are no contradictions between the article and the facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made in the article are supported by evidence from reputable sources like the ILO.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The global economy has created a system where 85 super wealthy individuals have more money than the poorest 3.5 billion people combined. This centralization of wealth accelerates with each passing year, resulting in widespread poverty and hunger. The United Nations reports that nearly 30 million people are enslaved globally, with India having the largest proportion of exploitation within its own borders.

Human trafficking is a significant issue, with millions of women and children being sold for sex, slavery, or organs. According to UNODC, 79% of detected trafficking victims are women and children. The ""horrendous crime"" of human trafficking affects nearly every country in the world, with an estimated global value of $150 billion.

Radical ideologies, such as ISIS, have been linked to violence against women and children. In one case, Kayla Mueller was held as a sex slave by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who repeatedly raped her.

Antifa groups are promoting violence against police officers and advocating for armed insurrection. An armed Antifa group has launched a new cell in Philadelphia, with support from alternative media outlets.

The world is facing significant challenges, including poverty, hunger, human trafficking, and radical ideologies. It is essential to address these issues through meaningful solutions that empower individuals and families to work hard and build businesses.","The articles discuss various social issues, including women's rights, infidelity, modern slavery, and health education. 

A book on women's rights emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing problems in developing countries, while also acknowledging that solutions require governments to get involved. The authors favor crackdowns on sex work as a means of changing traffickers' economic incentives but also present arguments for decriminalization with regulation.

An article on infidelity highlights the nuances of ranking different types of infidelity, such as having sex with a prostitute versus an emotional affair. Couples' therapists and experts argue that many mates make allowances for impersonal, anonymous sex.

A report on Maryland's troubled Baltimore jail reveals widespread corruption and gang control, with some guards having sex with inmates or smuggling contraband. The FBI and prosecutors have previously characterized the jail as being run by members of the Black Guerrilla Family gang.

Article 1 - 85 super wealthy people have more money than the poorest 3.5 billion combined
(before it's news) the global economy is structured to systematically funnel wealth to the very top of the pyramid, and this centralization of global wealth is accelerating with each passing year. according to the united nations, 85 super wealthy people have more money than the poorest 3.5 billion people on the planet combined. and 1.2 billion of those poor people live on less than $$1.25 a day. there is something deeply, deeply broken about a system that produces these kinds of results. seven out of every ten people on the planet live in countries where the gap between the wealthy and the poor has increased in the last 30 years. despite our technological advances, somewhere around a billion people go to bed hungry every single night. and when our fundamentally flawed financial system finally does collapse, it will be the poor that will suffer the worst. now, let me make one thing clear at the outset. big government and more socialism are not the answer to anything. big government and more socialism almost always result in increased oppression and increased poverty. if you want to see where that road ultimately leads to, just look at north korea. what we need is a system that empowers individuals and families to work hard, be creative, build businesses and to take care of themselves. but instead, we have a system where all power and all wealth are increasingly controlled by giant banks and giant corporations that are in turn controlled by the global elite. the “financialization” of the global economy has

archbishop mamberti proposes world day against persecution of christians (before it's news) vatican city, 7 dec 2011 (vis) – archbishop dominique mamberti, the holy see’s secretary for relations with states, addressed the eighteenth ministerial council of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) held this 6–7 december in vilnius, lithuania. in his address, the archbishop discussed, among other themes, the topic of migration, which for the holy see constitutes an argument of constant interest, above all in the actual circumstances of economic and financial crisis. msgr. mamberti noted that there is a growing consensus in the international community on the necessity of paying greater attention to migrants. in this context he emphasized that it is necessary to support migrants reunification with their families since “the family plays a fundamental role in the integration process, in giving stability to the presence of the immigrants in the new social environment … migrants, aware of their rights, can be more secure in offering their services and talents and the receiving community, well-informed and respectful of these rights, will feel freer in extending its solidarity in order to build together a common future”. the secretary for relations with states also addressed the organization’s commitments in defence of fundamental freedoms and human rights, one of which is the right to freedom of religion. “the right to religious freedom, despite being repeatedly proclaimed by the international community, as well as in

Article 3 - the internet post
a report by an international foundation on modern slavery has revealed that nearly 30 million people are enslaved across the globe. the index released by the walk free foundation (wff) on thursday said the slaves are either trafficked into brothels, forced into manual labor, fall victims to debt bondage, or are even born into servitude. almost half of these people are in india, where “by far the largest proportion of this problem is the exploitation of indian citizens within india itself, particularly through debt bondage and bonded labor,” the survey found. the index also showed that aside from india, the problem is most rampant in the west african country of mauritania, where four percent of the population is estimated to be held in slavery. the report by the australian-based group described mauritania as a nation with “deeply entrenched hereditary slavery,” where “people in slavery may be bought and sold, rented out and given away as gifts.” benin, gambia, gabon, ivory coast, haiti and nepal are among other countries with the highest prevalence of modern slavery, the report said. the wff index ranked 162 countries on the number of people living in slavery, the risk of enslavement, and the strength of government action to counter the illegal activity. figures indicate human trafficking along with arms dealing is the second largest industry in the world after drug dealing. advertisements share this: print google email facebook twitter reddit like this: like loading... read full post »

disturbing video of humans being sold proves us foreign policy has made slavery mainstream again headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! last week, cnn published a report detailing the slave trade occurring in present-day libya. while it’s easy to write off cnn as “fake news”, as the sitting president of the united states so infamously proclaims, a closer look into the phenomena of humans being sold at auction in the year 2017 confirms the unthinkable — slavery is mainstream again. however, cnn is not giving you the reason why people are being traded for cash, bought and sold at auction, for as little as $400. according to the new york times, the cause of the travesty goes all the way back to the united states’ backing of the so-called “arab spring,” an uprising which eventually led to the overthrow of libya’s leader, muammar gaddafi. since the arab spring uprising of 2011 ended the brutal rule of col. muammar el-qaddafi, libya’s coast has became a hub for human trafficking and smuggling. that has fueled the illegal migration crisis that europe has been scrambling to contain since 2014. however, the destabilized hub for slavery and terrorism that we see today is not just from the arab spring. the obama administration, led by then-secretary of state, hillary r. clinton, orchestrated qaddafi’s overthrow. secretary clinton even laughed at qaddafi’s

Article 1 - seeing women’s rights as a key to countries’ progress
the authors nicely combine commitment with caution about what we know and don’t know, what does good and what might not. the many failures of foreign aid are not neglected; the aim is simply to show that recognition can stimulate improvement. similarly, their attitude toward sex work is nuanced. although they favor crackdowns on all sex work as the best means of changing traffickers’ economic incentives, they also present the argument for decriminalization with regulation. the readability of the book should not make one underestimate the care of the analysis. by locating the problems they describe in the “developing world,” mr. kristof and ms. wudunn surely paint too rosy a picture of what happens to women in richer countries. there, they say, “discrimination is usually a matter of unequal pay or underfunded sports teams or unwanted touching from a boss.” tell that to the 18 percent of women in the united states who, according to the authoritative national violence against women survey, say they have experienced rape or attempted rape. acknowledging misogyny close to home helps us think better about its sources and possible remedies. still, the book is both stirring and sensible. the problems are important, they hamper development, and progress can be made on all of them if the political will can be forged. so, while not denying that solutions ultimately require governments to get involved, the authors focus on the creation of a worldwide momentum toward solution and appeal to readers to join in a wide range of nong

Article 2 - sifting through the ruins of infidelity
she added: “is an erotic massage sex? what is sex? the bill clinton question of all time.” many of those who have been cheated on say there’s no such thing as ranking when it comes to infidelity. having sex with a prostitute. sleeping with the nanny, a co-worker or a neighbor. getting a massage from a naked masseuse. touching the naked masseuse. those nuances seem to escape users of survivinginfidelity.com, a site for the betrayed that recently featured a posting by a woman who wrote that her boyfriend had just being arrested at a massage parlor with a prostitute. “i slapped him several times,” the woman wrote. “then i kicked him out.” another user replied: “my opinion is to keep him kicked out and thank your lucky stars” you are not married to him. at the heart of the matter, those commiserating with the woman said, were the lying, the betrayal of trust and even the risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease. but couples’ therapists and other experts say many mates make allowances when it comes to impersonal, anonymous, businesslike sex (or almost sex). a tryst for pay, for example, may be more forgivable than a long affair or emotional infidelity, such as the kind carried on by e-mail and instant messaging. “it’s the idea of having an emotional or intellectual mind meld over the long term that’s hardest to recover from,” said carrie sloan, the editor in chief

Article 6 - homosexuality in priesthood is under increasing scrutiny
no reliable statistics exist about either the extent of the abuse or broader questions about the sexuality of the clergy. a church built on a theoretically chaste priesthood has had little interest in commissioning or even permitting such studies. eugene kennedy, an emeritus professor of psychology at loyola university of america, said that in the last 15 years american bishops had asked him more than once to conduct a study of priests' sexuality, but that other bishops had quashed the idea. concerning sexual abuse, the church has not kept comprehensive records on how many priests have been accused or found guilty, though the recent scrutiny has prompted some dioceses to review 50 years of personnel records and compile lists of problem priests. the philadelphia diocese, for example, reported 35. still, the only nationwide effort at record-keeping has been done by victims' lawyers like sylvia demarest in dallas and jeffrey anderson in st. paul, who claim to have assembled lists of more than 1,000 priests accused of abuse in the united states. it is unknown how many of these accusations involve men who are no longer in the priesthood, were wrongly accused, or whose cases date back four or more decades. there are currently 46,075 priests in the united states. scientists who have studied sexual offenders warn that the scandal in the church has caused two distinct issues -- homosexuality and child abuse -- to become erroneously and recklessly intertwined. they note that homosexuals

Article 7 - health officials put safer-sex message online
""in public health, we like to go where the action is, so it's a critical venue,"" he said. because internet intervention is still in its infancy, most of the efforts have been started by local agencies, with little data to guide them on effective strategies. many health workers say these programs can be particularly useful in reaching men in rural areas, young gay men and others who may not want to identify themselves or visit a gay community center. ""i think the anonymity is extremely helpful,"" said lyndon cudlitz, 21, education and outreach coordinator for outright, a maine gay rights group that posts profiles of peer counselors who can answer questions about safer sex and other health-related issues. ""because we never know who it is, they can ask any kind of question without needing to feel embarrassed."" the question of how to reach men online has grown in urgency with studies suggesting that men who find sexual partners through the internet have a different profile from other gay men. according to a study from the los angeles department of health, two-thirds of men who met male sexual partners online were h.i.v. positive. they were also three and a half times as likely to have anonymous sex and twice as likely to use injection drugs as men who met partners elsewhere. a san francisco study found that 39 percent of 91 men surveyed about their online activities reported having had unprotected anal intercourse with men they had met online. public and private agencies in san francisco have developed some of the most

Article 8 - girls on our streets
i’ve often reported on sex trafficking in other countries, and that has made me curious about the situation here in the united states . prostitution in america isn’t as brutal as it is in, say, india , nepal , pakistan , cambodia and malaysia (where young girls are routinely kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured by brothel owners, occasionally even killed). but the scene on american streets is still appalling — and it continues largely because neither the authorities nor society as a whole show much interest in 14-year-old girls pimped on the streets. americans tend to think of forced prostitution as the plight of mexican or asian women trafficked into the united states and locked up in brothels. such trafficking is indeed a problem, but the far greater scandal and the worst violence involves american teenage girls. if a middle-class white girl goes missing, radio stations broadcast amber alerts, and cable tv fills the air with “missing beauty” updates. but 13-year-old black or latina girls from poor neighborhoods vanish all the time, and the pimps are among the few people who show any interest. photo these domestic girls are often runaways or those called “throwaways” by social workers: teenagers who fight with their parents and are then kicked out of the home. these girls tend to be much younger than the women trafficked from abroad and, as best i can tell, are more likely to be controlled by force. pimps are not the business partners they purport to be. they typically take

an innocent man was mistakenly pulled over by an arizona state trooper and threatened to be shot in the back in front of his daughter. recently, true activist enlightened readers on the various reasons police officers in the u.s. kill more people per day than cops in norway have in the past decade. in addition to undergoing drastically less time in training, cops in the u.s. are not educated on how to de-escalate situations. instead, they enter situations with defensive, fear-based mentalities and, as was witnessed in the case of alton sterling and philando castile, oftentimes end up hurting more people than helping. recently, the world was presented with another example of this. a man named ken walton was driving around in a rental car with his 7-year-old daughter when an arizona state trooper pulled him over. the facebook post he shared relays that without warning, the situation quickly escalated. walton wrote: “tonight, i was arrested at gunpoint by an arizona highway patrol officer who threatened to shoot me in the back (twice) in front of my 7-year-old daughter. for a moment, i was certain he was going to kill me for no reason. i’m alive, and i need to share the story. please share it, because i have an important reason for staying up past 1 a.m. to write it down.” the pair was pulled over in williams, arizona. walton thought the

Article 4 - medical examiner revises suspect’s death ruling to homicide
medical examiner revises suspect’s death ruling to homicide % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) gina barton of the journal sentinel writes: the milwaukee county medical examiner’s office has revised its ruling on the death of derek williams, who died in milwaukee police custody in july 2011, from natural to homicide, according to the district attorney’s office. the decision came after the journal sentinel alerted an assistant medical examiner to newly released records – including a video of a suffocating williams pleading for help from the back of a squad car – and also made him aware of a national expert who said williams, 22, did not die naturally of sickle cell crisis. in making his initial determination of natural death more than a year ago, assistant medical examiner christopher poulos did not review all of the police reports or a squad video recently obtained by the newspaper. the video shows a handcuffed williams, his eyes rolled back, gasping for breath and begging for help in the back seat of a milwaukee police car as officers ignore his pleas. the police reports include key details about williams’ arrest that the medical examiner didn’t know. as a result of the new ruling, milwaukee county district attorney john chisholm is reopening his investigation into whether criminal charges are warranted against any of the officers involved. chisholm, the police department and the fire and police commission previously had

Article 5 - sex offender laws require rethink
sex offender laws require rethink (before it's news) sex offender laws are gratuitously cruel and assume that all ex-offenders are dangerous psychopaths. however the vast majority can be rehabilitated and lead normal productive lives. most sex offenders deserve compassion. current laws make it harder for registered sex offenders to reform. by ryan hope (pen name of a colorado therapist) (henrymakow.com) i have chosen to take on this unpopular issue because i have something that needs to be said. contrary to popular belief that once a sex offender, he will always be a sex offender, recidivism rates are quite low for offenders that get counselling. at about 6%, they are much lower than many other types of criminal recidivism. that means 94% don’t re-offend. this is compared to only 30% in the case of other offences. yes, a minority of sex offenders are sociopaths or psychopaths. they are violent re-offender types, serial rapists and those that get sadistic pleasure torturing or killing. these people should never be trusted to reenter into society. but the majority of sex offenders can be reformed, but the law won’t let them or anybody else forget. some of my colleagues work with ex-offenders and they report a high degree of depression, homelessness and suicide. when they return home from prison, they may not be allowed to move into their own homes because it is too close to a school

Article 1 - doubts in cold case that was thought solved
early on the morning of that oct. 13, ms. otten awoke to thumping sounds and moaning. she heard a door shut and found ms. antonetti on the couch, holding her head. “i didn’t recognize her, and she was covered in blood,” ms. otten recalled during mr. davis’s trial last year. she called 911 and woke johnny. his mother was unable to answer his questions about what had happened. before she slipped into a coma at the hospital, she kissed him. “that was it,” he told the jury. “she didn’t regain consciousness again.” donn chelli, who lived in the same apartments, also called 911 that morning. he reported seeing a tall, husky man with long, blond hair holding a bat. (mr. davis was shorter, thinner and had dark hair and a mustache.) mr. chelli confronted the blond man, who angrily said that mr. chelli was the second person who had bothered him that night. the men quickly parted ways, and mr. chelli called the police, who made a composite sketch of the man he described. later, mr. chelli tentatively identified john martin odem in a police lineup as the man with the bat. mr. odem, known as marty, also lived in the complex and was convicted in 1986 of breaking into another woman’s apartment there and raping her. he denied killing ms. anton

Article 2 - the strauss-kahn case
long after tuesday’s dismissal of sexual assault charges against dominique strauss-kahn, people will still be debating the facts and how the manhattan district attorney, cyrus vance jr., handled the high-profile case. what seems clear is that mr. vance was right to notify mr. strauss-kahn’s lawyers and the court in july about troubling inconsistencies in the account of the accuser, nafissatou diallo, and to drop the charges this week. there is a legitimate concern that his decision may discourage rape victims from coming forward in the future. women who have been assaulted often worry, with reason, about being victimized a second time in court. and those with problematic backgrounds must feel confident that they can demand and receive justice. we will never know what really happened in that hotel room. in the 25-page dismissal motion, prosecutors recounted the inconsistencies in ms. diallo’s three conflicting descriptions of what happened during and after the alleged assault at a manhattan hotel. they said they were also troubled by a “pattern of untruthfulness” about her past, including a convincingly delivered, though fictional, story of being gang raped by soldiers in her native guinea and a recorded conversation that prosecutors say captured her discussing making money from the case, which her lawyer disputes. advertisement continue reading the main story dna evidence showed mr. strauss-kahn “engaged in a hurried sexual encounter” with his accuser, but there was insufficient evidence to establish

Article 3 - suspect in rape absorbed pain and inflicted it
''he is a complete lunatic,'' said michael sheehan, a former homicide investigator whose work helped prosecute mr. reyes for the murder of lourdes gonzalez. ms. gonzalez, 24, was raped and stabbed nine times in her basement apartment on east 97th street in june 1989. her three small children were listening through a bedroom door as their pregnant mother was sexually assaulted, then murdered. two other women who survived their encounter with mr. reyes told the police that he had given them a stark choice at knife point -- your eyes or your life. they took the first choice, and then he stabbed them around the eyes, although the wounds proved superficial, according to investigators. in the attack on the jogger, her injuries were so severe that several detectives who worked on the case continue to believe it could not have been the work of just one man. mr. reyes, now 31, was finally captured in august 1989, four months after attacking the jogger. by his own account now, he had committed one murder, five rapes, two attempted rapes and an untallied number of muggings. he was caught by two men in the lobby of a building on east 91st street after a woman who had just been raped in her apartment dashed down the stairs in a towel. ''even as a child growing up in the school system, he exhibited violent behavior,'' said richard siracusa,

Article 4 - man arrested in california case of child's abduction and killing
he said that thousands of tips from the public, an investigation involving hundreds of officers and help from the news media in circulating a description of the suspect had all helped to assemble what he called a quick resolution to the manhunt. while he said a trail of evidence had led investigators to mr. avila, sheriff carona emphasized that the investigation was far from over and that he did not want the stream of information that poured in from callers to dry up just because a suspect had been arrested. ''you have been our allies all along,'' he said, referring to the news media and public. ''this in no way concludes our investigation. we are still trying to make sure we bring this man to justice.'' police officials here have made it clear that their evidence, which is believed to include items like fibers that were found on the body, ties mr. avila to the girl, who was sexually assaulted and suffocated before being left on the edge of a road called killen trail near lake elsinore. mr. avila had worked since september as an assembler at the temecula, calif., plant of the guidant corporation, an indianapolis company that makes cardiac and vascular products like pacemakers and coronary stents. mr. avila, who is in custody, lived with his mother at a low-income apartment complex in lake elsinore, about 60 miles from stanton and about 10 miles from the roadside scrub where samantha's body was found. some

Article 5 - a cold case of cold blood, revisited
both have said through their lawyers that they are not guilty. what happened on that winter night more than 20 years ago is a mystery waiting to be solved. a friend of mr. mangelsdorf, the rev. chris launius, who was vice president of the student body at the time, said that he believed at the time that his friend was innocent, and that he wants the truth to ultimately come out. ''if we were wrong, it's a horrible deal,'' he said of the events in olathe 20-plus years ago. ''and if we were right and they are putting him through this again, it's horrible too.'' prosecutors in olathe (pronounced oh-lay-thuh) were unambiguous about the complaint in december in which they charged mrs. raisch and named mr. mangelsdorf as a party to the crime, which was discovered early in the morning of feb. 28, 1982. the complaint says, ''mark mangelsdorf and/or melinda harmon aka melinda raisch struck david harmon numerous times in the head with a blunt instrument, killing him. mark mangelsdorf and/or melinda harmon aka melinda raisch moved the blanket covering the body of david harmon, pulled out a drawer in the bedroom and took a lid off a dish containing keys to make it appear as though a residential robbery had occurred.'' later: ''mark mangelsdorf left the above mentioned residence and disposed of the murder

Article 6 - peterson jury is asked to put aside feelings for defendant
""if you presume this guy is guilty, you can put a sinister spin on anything,"" said mr. geragos, later reminding jurors, ""you must not be influenced by sentiment, conjecture or passion."" the prosecution argued that mr. peterson killed his pregnant wife to escape the drudgery of married life and fatherhood, all in an effort to follow a fantasy to lead the life a wealthy jet-set bachelor, free to travel the world seeking adventure. but in his closing, mr. geragos sprinted through a series of other explanations for all of mr. peterson's contradictory statements and erratic behavior after his wife disappeared on or around dec. 23, 2002. for example, mr. geragos replayed the period around the time of ms. peterson's disappearance. he pointed to little-discussed facts like confiscated records on internet activity the morning ms. peterson may have disappeared, showing that someone had been looking at a gap advertisement and printing french toast recipes. mr. geragos argued that those facts proved that ms. peterson was home and alive on dec. 24, when mr. peterson left for a brief fishing trip. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing.

Article 8 - despite bans, the use of chokeholds persists
for more than two decades, all manner of chokeholds have been banned by the new york police department. recruits learn not to use them in the academy; officers are periodically reminded of the ban in training materials. but despite its dangers, the maneuver can be effective in subduing a resisting person, and it has been tough to eliminate its use by officers. on thursday, an officer gripped the neck of a staten island man resisting arrest for selling loose cigarettes, holding him with his arm as they fell to the ground. the man, eric garner, later died, prompting outrage and setting off a new round of scrutiny of the stubborn persistence of a banned practice. mr. garner’s case immediately brought to mind the last time the city focused on a man’s death after an officer’s chokehold. then, as now, commissioner william j. bratton led the police. it was 1994, not long after the police department banned the use of chokeholds, and anthony baez was tossing a football with his brothers in the bronx and struck a patrol car. soon his neck was pinned in a police officer’s grip. according to the city’s chief medical examiner, mr. baez died of asphyxiation.

Article 4 - the $$750 decadence d’or cupcake
the $$750 decadence d’or cupcake % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) imagine a room full of food writers all jostling for view of a single cupcake? here in a beautiful banquet room at the venetian and palazzo hotels, chef johann springinsfeld of france charms the foodie journalists attending the ifwtwa 2012 conference in las vegas into submission but is still intent on charming the rémy martin cognac to stay inside the blown-sugar fleur-de-lis that will crown the $$750 cupcake. a homage to decadence, it is fun to turn away and escape into a dream of indulgent excess via this cupcake. chef johann, born in france, at a young age fancied creating homemade cakes. he left home for a pastry apprenticeship program at 16. after 10 years of working throughout france, learning from some of the best chefs in the world, he became chef for a catering company, expanding the company of 7 to more than 30 in one year. in 2002, he opened his own business on the french riviera and then moved to las vegas in 2006 to help a friend with a catering company. immersing himself in the american culture and language, he took the pastry chef position with the venetian and the palazzo. the rest, as they say, is history. when asked

Article 5 - christmas ale fruit loaf
christmas ale fruit loaf (before it's news) i was given home baked by eric lanlard a few months ago and have finally got round to making one of his cakes. i’ve done the recipe for his ale fruit loaf but in the spirit of the season i used harvey’s christmas ale instead of a regular one. the recipe also lists wholemeal self-raising flour as an ingredient. as i didn’t have any in the cupboard i used wholemeal spelt flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder to the mixture. i do love fruit cake and wensleydale cheese – i think that is my yorkshire roots coming out – and this cake is perfect for that combination. did you know by the way that wensleydale cheese production also had to finish in the 1990s due to such low sales. it was however featured in the wallace & gromit animations and sales shot up saving this lovely cheese which was originally created by french cistercian monks who settled in wensleydale in the 14th century. in his book eric also suggests serving it toasted and buttered with raspberry jam which would be delicious too. either way this is a great cake for eating in front of the tv on those days between christmas and ny just as it’s getting dark outside and it’s all cosy inside (or while typing up a blog post….). this cake is also my entry into december’s tea time treats, a monthly baking challenge hosted

(before it's news) i recently received samples of that’s it bars, in return for an honest review. i missed lunch one day at work (dreaded deadlines!) and grabbed a bar. at first glance, it looked like a larabar. at first bite, it tasted similar to a larabar but then it didn’t. it was much lighter. suddenly i was reminded of fruit roll-ups, which then made me feel like i was eating candy. and then i was really happy because the candy i was eating was 1 apple + 3 apricots. from the package: ingredients: apples, apricots. seriously…that’s it! from the website: antioxidant powerhouse! apricots have very high levels of antioxidants that play a major role in immunity and day-to-day health. other flavors: apples + cherries and apples + pears. i tried them all. honest opinion? i loved all three flavors. that’s it. *** be sure to enter for your chance to win a copy of the tipsy vegan! i will announce the two, yes two, winners sunday! read more at jl goes vegan source:

Article 7 - the taste of eastern europe– in brooklyn: korzo
the taste of eastern europe– in brooklyn: korzo (before it's news) greenwood’s feathered inhabitants: wild monk parrots… yup: parrots…in brooklyn at the end of june, anthony and i decided to spend the day at greenwood cemetery. not only was it a favorite spot of the writer h.p. lovecraft, but it’s easily one of the most beautiful, most tranquil places to walk in all of new york city. a dear aunt of mine is buried there as well, so it was a familiar place for much of my adolescence. as usual, i scouted around online for places to go eat in the area—either for lunch or dinner. it’s been a very long time since i was at greenwood, but my last memories of local eateries consisted of pizza joints, taquerias, and the occasional chinese takeout. sure enough, looking online, the top 25 places to eat in terms of popularity were all just that—pizzarias, taquerias, and chinese restaurants. but, then i saw an unusual name: korzo. it was in the top 10. it didn’t sound italian, mexican or chinese. the mini-description said eastern european. visiting the website and seeing things like butternut squash pirogi, paprikáš, and an absinthe cocktail called the ottomobile had me doing something i don’t normally do—making reservations. acres. we

starfruit smoothie % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) recently, heaped baskets of starfruit, or carambola, have infiltrated the market. i never worked with starfruit before. and up until this year, i don’t think i had ever tasted one, either. perfectly ripe: yellow, firm, and tinged with brown we had starfruit smoothies in masaya and were quite smitten by the sliver of starfruit perched on the lip of the glass. it lent a magical quality to the whole affair. like maybe there were fairies hovering by the blender. starfruit and pitaya: it doesn’t get more tropical than this. the smoothies were delicious, and the raw fruit garnish tasted good, too. crisp, juicy, and clean. they say starfruit is like a cross between apples and grapes in both taste and texture. it sounds complicated, but it’s true. take one bite and you’ll see. since i was a novice at handling starfruit, i first watched two youtube videos—one on how to cut up a starfruit and the other on how to use it in a smoothie—before proceeding. i thought it’d be a tricky process, what with the five pointy sides. but it’s really quite easy. first, wash the fruit. second, chop off the ends as you do a cucumber. third, run a knife along each of the

Article 1 - making his case for the second montalcino
well, if i’m going to be the only enthusiastic voice in the room, allow me to make my case. first, what is rosso di montalcino? simply put, it’s a category of wine intended to make life a little easier for brunello producers, who are required to age brunellos a minimum of two years in barrels and two more in bottles before they can sell it. that’s a substantial investment. by contrast, rosso di montalcino must be aged a minimum of only a year, including six months in oak barrels. theoretically at least, this division also permits producers to elevate the quality of the top wine by siphoning off any grapes or wine that does not meet their standards for the brunello. for consumers, rosso ought to be a fresher, easier-drinking wine that does not require prolonged cellar aging. in a word, it ought to be more joyous than contemplative. so, what’s the issue? perhaps it’s the inherent nature of the sangiovese grown in montalcino, which tends to be richer and more concentrated than that grown in the chianti zones. as a result, good chiantis, in which sangiovese is the dominant rather than the sole grape, will generally be more graceful and finer textured than the montalcino. the montalcinos will be denser and more powerful; the best combine muscularity with elegance. i love both expressions. the gorgeous, earthy

Article 2 - brownies with caramel: sweet and salty in a committed relationship
the people at baked have experimented with mint, coffee, chile and other variations — but the only one to join the permanent roster is the sweet and salty brownie, an ingenious combination of blond, bittersweet caramel and dark, bittersweet chocolate that now outsells the original. they are not the first bakers to note the affinity of caramel and chocolate, but by emphasizing the bitter, sweet and salty notes in both, they’ve made that rare thing: a perfectly balanced bite. photo it is a spinoff of their sweet and salty cake, a layer cake with multiple components and extraordinary flavors that are equally compelling in the form of a brownie that you can make this very afternoon. in addition to a brownie batter, all it takes is a basic caramel. (do not stop reading. making caramel does involve high heat, but so does making pasta: the process doesn’t have to be terrifying or traumatic.) many recipes for home cooks call for melting down kraft caramels, or using store-bought sauce. that sticky substance is a world away from the creamy, tangy, complexity of this homemade sauce. you can thank the sour cream. and use the extra sauce on ice cream, cookies or cake. here are tips for a painless caramel: use a large saucepan and moderate heat. it’s o.k. if the caramel cooks slowly. use part sugar and part corn syrup, which prevents it from crystallizing, so don’t worry about the caramel seizing

Article 3 - cherries' garish glory revived
maraschino cherries? why bother?'' this was not the response i was looking for when i mentioned to a friend that i was going to undertake a homemade version. ''what would you use them in besides shirley temples, anyway?'' she added, wrinkling her nose. though she forgot about manhattans and rob roys, she had a point. homemade maraschino cherries are not the most practical of recipes. then again, i'm not always the most practical of cooks. but making maraschino cherries wasn't about practicality, or trying to mimic those vinyl-textured, frighteningly neon and once potentially carcinogenic (remember red dye no. 2?) orbs. i was trying to recapture the glory of a faded confection. a century ago, maraschino cherries were concocted from croatian marasca cherries macerated in their fragrant liqueur. when added to cocktails and desserts, they were an elegant touch. but the temperance movement, a glut of oregon cherries and a preserving process that involved oceans of lipstick-red dye, corn syrup and almond extract conspired to give us a cocktail garnish not highly prized as a fruit. history aside, what i really wanted was something delectable to float in my manhattan. in the height of fresh cherry season, it seemed a worthy pursuit. i surfed online for substitutes for the unavailable marasca. opinions varied from

Article 4 - living and drinking in the moment
to take the temperature of the current crop of albariños in the marketplace, the wine panel recently sampled 25 bottles, 17 from the 2006 vintage and 8 from the 2007. for the tasting, florence fabricant and i were joined by stephen paul mancini, the wine and spirits director at union square cafe, and my friend rafael mateo, the proprietor of pata negra, a ham and tapas bar in the east village. most of the albariños, at least the ones that we liked, fit into two main categories. some were lean and crisp, with pronounced mineral and citrus flavors. others were round and plump, retaining the citrus and mineral qualities, but emphasizing peach, cantaloupe and tropical fruit flavors. either way, the good ones were consummate summer wines, a paradox, as florence pointed out, because they come from the atlantic coast of spain, where persistent rainfall and mist can make summer fleeting at best. as enjoyable as albariños can be, they are modest wines, easy to enjoy without prolonged analysis. while the wines were fairly consistent, we did have to navigate through some dull, insipid examples. that’s not a surprise, given its success. when a wine like an albariño achieves something approaching brand status, some producers may try to capitalize by emphasizing quantity over quality. nonetheless, many of these wines remain good values despite the exchange

Article 7 - riffs on a chocolate theme
now that most new year's resolutions have melted away like marshmallows in hot cocoa, it's time to indulge those chocolate cravings. to that end, here are three artisanal chocolates to satisfy the pangs. they are handmade in small batches by passionate, slightly obsessed confectioners, and are about as different as they can be: a good thing, as it makes having all three kinds in the house at once seem reasonable. the intense caramelized almonds from xocoatl, a new chocolate shop in taos, n.m., are covered in dark chocolate and a dusting of cocoa. the chocolatier, scott j. van rixel, buys premium criollo cocoa nibs (crushed roasted cocoa beans) from el rey, a manufacturer in venezuela. he grinds them by hand in a metate, a mortarlike vessel like the one the mayans used. the resulting chocolate has a vaguely smoky, cherrylike flavor that's deeper and more lingering than the usual swiss stuff. it's very good eaten on its own, but i like it better as a coating for almonds, which add a rich, nutty, toasted taste that's about as addictive as, well, chocolate-covered nuts, but much more interesting than most.

Title: high concepts fall flat on the palate
Content: luxee 6 clinton street (east houston street); (212) 375-1796. it’s easy to like luxee, the dessert bar that opened last month on the lower east side. it feels like a simple neighborhood cafe, but it’s actually a satellite of l’école vantan, a fashion and culinary school in tokyo. all the meticulously composed desserts are organic, though whether they’re good for you, as luxee claims, is a discussion for you and your nutritionist. photo too bad some of these high concepts fall flat on the palate. the menu is short: five desserts, two salads and several kinds of cookies, including the addictive rosemary sablés ($7 for a box of 11). but the vegan green forest parfait ($12), a chocolate mousse made with whipped avocado, could have used some of the sin of dairy, while the normandy cheesecake ($12), made with camembert, could have used less. the chef’s special caramel apple ($14), on the other hand, is a masterpiece, three manifestations of caramel (in a milk chocolate mousse, as a brittle and as a sauce), matched by four stages of apple (frozen in a sorbet with basil, as a gelée, in a semifreddo and as a neat row of raw slices), all arrayed beneath a sugar dome as thin as a soap bubble. it’s an impressive sight. the interplay of flavors is kaleidoscopic, all you imagine caramel and apples could be. what a shame that it feels grandly out of place, a course in search of a meal.

The Trump-Russia Dossier contains unsubstantiated claims about Russian officials trying to influence Donald Trump. The memos were shared with the FBI and journalists, but its validity remains unconfirmed.

A classified report on Russian hacking and leaking efforts was attached to a report given to President Obama, Mr. Trump, and congressional leaders. However, American intelligence agencies have not confirmed the allegations made in the dossier.

The FBI is investigating a leak about a Qaeda plot that may have compromised international cooperation. The leak occurred after the White House and CIA asked for restraint on publishing an article about the plot.

Robert Parry writes that Washington groupthink has led to ignoring evidence that undercuts narratives about Russia-Gate. Despite this, some stories have highlighted potential back-channel meetings between Trump and Putin.

The 9/11 inquiry criticized senior officials for failing to prepare the US intelligence community for the attacks. The director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, was singled out for criticism.

Whistleblower protection has been a contentious issue in the Bush administration. The Supreme Court ruled that federal employees have no right to First Amendment protection when reporting government waste and folly.

The FBI is investigating who leaked classified material about 9/11 to reporters. Lawmakers on intelligence committees have refused polygraph tests, citing constitutional concerns.

The NSA's data mining program was at the center of a dispute over surveillance powers. The Senate Intelligence Committee called the testimony given by Attorney General Gonzales ""deceptive"" and demanded a perjury investigation.

Article 2 - f.b.i. chief says leak on qaeda plot is being investigated
the prosecutions have had strong bipartisan support from congress but have been sharply criticized by press advocates as misguided crackdowns on whistle-blowers. on wednesday, members of the senate committee endorsed the idea of the investigation. “regardless of political consequences, i hope that you get to the bottom of it,” said senator charles e. grassley, republican of iowa, the ranking member of the committee. “our international partners have been wary of cooperating with us in the wake of the wikileaks affair, in which our ability to keep their confidence was severely damaged.” the a.p. said it learned of the bomb plot two weeks ago but agreed not to publish an article about it in response to pleas from the white house and the central intelligence agency because an intelligence operation tied to the plot was under way. after the operation was completed, the a.p. published an article about how the qaeda affiliate in yemen planned to deploy a suicide bomber with an underwear bomb to blow up a plane headed to the united states. it was later revealed that the underwear bomb was smuggled out of yemen by a double agent working for saudi arabia. mr. grassley asked mr. mueller about the impact of the leak on the united states’ ability to work with its allies. “my hope is that it’ll have minimal impact,” mr. mueller said. “and i know that there are — discussions are going on with our partners overseas to make certain that whatever impact there is is

''the u.s. intelligence community,'' mr. shelby wrote, ''would have been far better prepared for sept. 11 but for the failure of successive agency leaders to work wholeheartedly to overcome the institutional and cultural obstacles to interagency cooperation and coordination that bedeviled counterterrorism efforts before the attacks.'' he added that the leaders whom he named were ''not responsible for the disaster of sept. 11, of course, for that infamy belongs to al qaeda's 19 suicide hijackers and the terrorist infrastructure that supported them.'' ''as the leaders of the united states intelligence community, however,'' he added, ''these officials failed in significant ways to ensure that this country was as prepared as it could have been.'' mr. tenet came in for some of the most pointed criticism. mr. shelby suggested that after mr. tenet issued a memo in 1998 saying the united states was ''at war'' with al qaeda, the c.i.a. director did not follow up by aggressively seeking additional money and resources for the fight against the terrorist organization. ''one of the great unanswered questions of our sept. 11 inquiry,

Article 6 - save the endangered whistle-blower
if ever government whistle-blowers needed protection from official retaliation it is now, in the secrecy-obsessed bush administration. federal employees daring to disclose fraud and abuse in their bureaucracies have been under virtual siege, isolated as pariahs and shipped off under gag orders to lesser jobs in far-off places. appeals to court review under the 17-year-old whistle-blower protection act have proved fruitless, with the supreme court ruling in may that workers have no right to first amendment protection when they warn lawmakers and taxpayers of government waste and folly. the ruling has thrown the issue back into the lap of congress. fortunately, there is enough anger emerging on both sides of the aisle to raise hopes for remedial legislation. the senate has unanimously approved an amendment to close loopholes and spell out whistle-blowers’ rights in more forceful detail for the courts. it is attached to a pending military bill, with proponents working for comparably tough legislation to be accepted by the house. the outcome is not certain. the justice department has been opposed to strengthening the law, and a countermove is afoot to give the administration even more power to prosecute whistle-blowers as leakers of official secrets. the coming showdown is a chance for electioneering incumbents to take a stand against the administration’s mania for foiling the public’s right to government transparency. the best display of congressional intent would be for lawmakers to not just reaffirm the 1989 law but to extend it to

Article 7 - f.b.i. inquiry on 9/11 leak upsets lawmakers on committees
the f.b.i. has interviewed dozens of members of the house and senate intelligence committees and asked them to submit to lie detector tests as part of an effort to learn who leaked classified material to reporters in the wake of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, congressional officials said today. but a number of the lawmakers on the committees have refused to take the polygraph tests and have voiced uneasiness over the constitutional precedent of being investigated by the agency they oversee, the officials said. ranit schmelzer, a spokeswoman for senator tom daschle of south dakota, the majority leader, said the inquiry had provoked ''grave concerns about the constitutional separation of powers issues raised by having one branch of government administering a polygraph to employees of another branch.'' still, ms. schmelzer said, the matter ''is between the house and senate intelligence committees and the justice department.'' advertisement continue reading the main story the committee had asked that the f.b.i. conduct the investigation into accusations of leaks of secret information by someone affiliated with the committee and, ms. schmelzer said, it was up to the bureau and the committee officials to develop appropriate guidelines. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred.

Article 8 - mining of data prompted fight over u.s. spying
if the dispute chiefly involved data mining, rather than eavesdropping, mr. gonzales’ defenders may maintain that his narrowly crafted answers, while legalistic, were technically correct. but members of the senate intelligence committee, who have been briefed on the program, called the testimony deceptive. “i’ve had the opportunity to review the classified matters at issue here, and i believe that his testimony was misleading at best,” said senator russ feingold, democrat of wisconsin, joining three other democrats in calling thursday for a perjury investigation of mr. gonzales. “this has gone on long enough,” mr. feingold said. “it is time for a special counsel to investigate whether criminal charges should be brought.” the senators’ comments, along with those of other members of congress briefed on the program, suggested that they considered the eavesdropping and data mining so closely tied that they were part of a single program. both activities, which ordinarily require warrants, were started without court approval as the bush administration intensified counterterrorism efforts soon after the sept. 11 attacks. a half-dozen officials and former officials interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity, in part because unauthorized disclosures about the classified program are already the subject of a criminal investigation. some of the officials said the 2004 dispute involved other issues in addition to the data mining, but would not provide details. they would not say whether the differences were over how the databases were

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The Trump-Russia Dossier contains unsubstantiated claims about Russian officials trying to influence Donald Trump. The memos were shared with the FBI and journalists, but its validity remains unconfirmed.

A classified report on Russian hacking and leaking efforts was attached to a report given to President Obama, Mr. Trump, and congressional leaders. However, American intelligence agencies have not confirmed the allegations made in the dossier.

The FBI is investigating a leak about a Qaeda plot that may have compromised international cooperation. The leak occurred after the White House and CIA asked for restraint on publishing an article about the plot.

Robert Parry writes that Washington groupthink has led to ignoring evidence that undercuts narratives about Russia-Gate. Despite this, some stories have highlighted potential back-channel meetings between Trump and Putin.

The 9/11 inquiry criticized senior officials for failing to prepare the US intelligence community for the attacks. The director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, was singled out for criticism.

Whistleblower protection has been a contentious issue in the Bush administration. The Supreme Court ruled that federal employees have no right to First Amendment protection when reporting government waste and folly.

The FBI is investigating who leaked classified material about 9/11 to reporters. Lawmakers on intelligence committees have refused polygraph tests, citing constitutional concerns.

The NSA's data mining program was at the center of a dispute over surveillance powers. The Senate Intelligence Committee called the testimony given by

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY

Upon reviewing the provided articles, it appears that they all share a common theme: ""this congressional hearing will blow you away! they just proved 'this' major conspiracy as fact."" However, there is no concrete information or evidence presented in these articles to support any specific claims.

The repetition of this phrase across multiple articles suggests that it may be an attention-grabbing statement rather than a factual report. Without further context or details, it is impossible to determine what ""this"" congressional hearing and ""this"" major conspiracy refer to.

It is also worth noting that the dates mentioned in some of the articles (e.g., 08-18-16, 08/26/2014) do not appear to be related to any actual events or investigations. These dates may be included as a way to create a sense of urgency or importance, but they do not provide any concrete evidence to support the claims made in the articles.

In summary, these articles lack specific details and evidence to support their claims, and it is unclear what ""this"" congressional hearing and ""this"" major conspiracy refer to.

Article 1 - endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama
endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama (before it's news) on sunday, we noted that washington’s strategy in syria has now officially unravelled. john kerry, speaking from london following talks with british foreign secretary philip hammond, essentially admitted over the weekend that russia’s move to bolster the assad regime at latakia effectively means that the timing of assad’s exit is now completely indeterminate. here’s how we summed up the situation: moscow, realizing that instead of undertaking an earnest effort to fight terror in syria, the us had simply adopted a containment strategy for isis while holding the group up to the public as the boogeyman par excellence, publicly invited washington to join russia in a once-and-for-all push to wipe islamic state from the face of the earth. of course the kremlin knew the us wanted no such thing until assad was gone, but by extending the invitation, putin had literally called washington’s bluff, forcing the white house to either admit that this isn’t about isis at all, or else join russia in fighting them. the genius of that move is that if washington does indeed coordinate its efforts to fight isis with moscow, the us will be fighting to stabilize the very regime it sought to oust. revelations (which surprised no one but the pentagon apparently) that moscow is coordinating its efforts in syria with tehran only serve to reinforce

november 8, 2017 by alex christoforou yesterday the duran reported on the latest, simmering crises in the middle east, where lebanon finds “itself in the thick of things as saudi arabia on monday accused it of declaring war on the kingdom through aggression by the iran-backed shiite group, hezbollah.” the arab country has thus been opened up as yet another territory of conflict between iran and saudi arabia.saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al-sabhan said the lebanese government would “be dealt with as one that is declaring war on saudi arabia” because of what he termed as aggression by hezbollah. sabhan blamed the hariri-led government for failing to rein-in hezbollah. this accusation comes days after lebanese prime minister, saad hariri resigned while sitting in saudi arabia, citing the interference of iran and hezbollah as the reason. he said: “there are those who will stop (hezbollah) and make it return to the caves of south lebanon. the lebanese must all know these risks and work to fix matters before they reach the point of no return”. now that syria is off the table for regime change, effectively blocking a saudi pipeline into the european market, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are zeroing in on lebanon. “lebanon – the next front in the great gas war

Article 8 - is peace becoming possible in syria?
(before it's news) middle east reporter for the independent patrick cockburn writes that the butchery could end now that the u.s. and russia want it to. he writes: the us and the europeans now genuinely want to end the war, something they have claimed to want since 2011 but which – for all their lamentations – always sounded somewhat hypocritical. put another way, they wanted the war to end but only if assad was overthrown or stepped down; and, since his forces have never held less than 13 of the 14 provincial capitals, this was a recipe for the war to continue. until early last year, many foreign politicians, diplomats and intelligence officials believed that assad was bound to go. but this was never likely to happen without a regime split or full-scale foreign military intervention. at the time, the states and movements being weakened by the war were the syrian government, iran and hezbollah – all enemies of the us, western europe, saudi arabia and the gulf monarchies. as for the jihadi groups, it seemed preferable to western intelligence for them to be heading for syria rather than to afghanistan, and their ability to flourish there was underestimated. this was the private view of many middle eastern politicians such as mowaffak al-rubaie, the former iraqi national security adviser, who told me last summer that the syrian civil war “is the best option for the

Article 1 - america’s dangerous mideast illusions
america’s neocon-driven interventions in the middle east have combined to create what is shaping up as a geopolitical disaster, with u.s.-backed “regime changes” contributing to victories by saudi-funded sunni extremists, as flynt and hillary mann leverett explain. by flynt leverett and hillary mann leverett the explosive ascendance of the islamic state in iraq and syria (isis) underscores the thoroughgoing failure of america’s political class to devise an effective and sustainable strategy for the united states after 9/11. the failure cuts across democratic and republican administrations, with the most self-damaging aspects of each administration’s policies roundly endorsed by the opposing party in congress. both sides deny responsibility for unfolding catastrophe in iraq: republicans criticize president barack obama’s marginal modulations of president george w. bush’s approach to the middle east while democrats blame iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki. (republicans also criticize maliki, but not so much that it might exculpate obama.) foreign policy elites also ignore a more urgent and ongoing flaw in america’s post-9/11 middle east policy that is directly linked to iraq’s current crisis, washington’s recurrent partnership with saudi arabia and other gulf arab states to arm, fund, and train sunni militias. america’s turn to jihadi proxies did not start with bush’s strategic malpractice in iraq.

Article 2 - israeli-saudi alliance slips into view
exclusive: the israeli-saudi détente is slowly emerging from the shadows, with a media report on a secret jerusalem meeting and israeli prime minister netanyahu’s oblique reference in his un speech. but this powerhouse collaboration could mean trouble for u.s. diplomacy in the mideast, reports robert parry. by robert parry on aug. 29, when i published an article entitled “the saudi-israeli superpower” describing an emerging odd-couple alliance between those two traditional enemies, the story was met with skepticism in some quarters. but, increasingly, this secret alliance is going public. on oct. 2, israel’s channel 2 tv news reported that senior israeli security officials met with a high-level gulf state counterpart in jerusalem, believed to be prince bandar bin sultan, the former saudi ambassador to the united states and now head of saudi intelligence. and, a day before that tv report, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu hinted at the new relationship in his united nations general assembly speech, which was largely devoted to excoriating iran over its nuclear program and threatening a unilateral israeli military strike. amid the bellicosity, netanyahu dropped in a largely missed clue about the evolving power relationships in the middle east, saying: “the dangers of a nuclear-armed iran and the emergence of other threats in our region have led many of our arab neighbors to recognize, finally

Article 3 - iran’s participation in meeting to aid iraq is ‘not appropriate,’ says kerry
in recent weeks, speculation has risen that the fight against isis might present an opportunity for the united states and iran to make common cause against a mutual foe and so improve relations. an alternative theory is the obama administration’s fight against isis may distract american officials from their effort to negotiate a deal limiting iran’s nuclear program. in his remarks, mr. kerry indicated that neither theory may be correct and that the obama administration has opted for a third approach, one in which the united states will continue to negotiate seriously on iran’s nuclear program even though washington and tehran have competing interests in iraq, syria and the rest of the middle east. outlining the administration’s iran policy, mr. kerry said the united states would continue to carry out what he called a “deep and serious conversation” with iranian officials on a possible agreement that would lift economic sanctions in return for serious constraints on iran’s nuclear program. at the same time, mr. kerry has said, the united states does not plan to coordinate with iran in the fight against isis in iraq. and while the white house has authorized the deputy secretary of state, william j. burns, to discuss regional issues with iranian officials on the margins of the nuclear talks, mr. kerry suggested that iran needed to curtail its military activities in syria before a fuller discussion of the situation in iraq and syria might be possible. “i.r.g

Article 4 - militants are said to amass missiles in south lebanon
still, officials worry that the buildup of so many rockets could tempt hezbollah to expand its operations. adding to this worry is the fear that iran or syria might encourage hezbollah to stir up tensions along israel's northern frontier to divert attention from iraq and complicate the bush administration's plans to topple saddam hussein. according to some analysts, neither iran nor syria wants to see an american occupation of iraq because they fear that it could be a platform for washington to project more power throughout the region. ''we may have to face this problem on the eve of going into iraq,'' said dennis ross, the clinton administration's special envoy to the middle east. ''i think there is a strong impulse on the part of the iranians and to a lesser extent the syrians to head us off in iraq because they fear they could be next. if suddenly there is a war raging between israel and its neighbors, that creates pressure to deal with that issue first and shifts attention away from iraq. the europeans and the arabs will be saying first things first.'' there is no consensus, however, as to iran's and syria's intentions. some israeli officials and analysts said that an american confrontation with iraq and the deployment of thousands more american troops in the region could make iran and syria more cautious and reduce the chances of an escalation of tensions along the israel-lebanon border. ''iran

Article 5 - ducking war responsibilities
conservatives insist that they revere the u.s. constitution, but congressional republicans as well as democrats hastily fled washington to hit the campaign trail rather than vote up or down on authorizing new wars in syria and iraq, an abdication of duty, says independent institute’s ivan eland. by ivan eland u.s. government officials recently began hyping the threat from a very small and little-known terrorist group called khorasan and then striking it in syria. several of president barack obama’s aides told the media that airstrikes were launched to foil an “imminent” terrorist attack, possibly using hidden explosives to blow up aircraft. yet other government officials seemed to pour cold water on that assessment. according to the new york times, one anonymous senior official described the khorasan plot as only “aspirational” and said that the group had not seemed to have established a concrete plan. other officials, at least one of who was a senior counterterrorism official, said that the plot was far from mature and that no sign existed that the group had decided on the method of attack or the time and target of it. these divergent stories should alert us to the possibility that the old saying, the first casualty of war is truth, is operating again (remember all the falsehoods surrounding then-president george w. bush’s invasion of iraq?). the times then cited some experts as explaining this divergence by saying that the obama administration may have developed

Article 7 - the impulse to intervene
the invasions of afghanistan and iraq followed by failed nation-building may have taught the u.s. government a few lessons in humility, but the temptation to intervene in crises around the world remains strong, with recent examples in syria and south sudan, notes the independent institute’s ivan eland. by ivan eland despite its massive annual federal budget deficits and national debt, the american superpower continues to meddle in faraway countries that pose little direct threat to u.s. national security. examples of those nanny-like interventions have recently occurred in syria and south sudan. the u.s. pentagon and state department, having learned the wrong lessons from post-american-invasion iraq, are now planning for a post-assad syria. undeterred by that previous mess, u.s. planners are busily concocting grandiose plans to remodel syria’s society, security, economy, and political system, despite the objection of the syrian opposition to foreign “transition plans.” according to the new york times, rafif jouejati, a spokesman for a network of syrian activists, said, “what we don’t want to do is descend into the total chaos that iraq did. i don’t think we want the united states to impose lessons learned here.” but those alleged lessons from iraq are exactly what u.s. officials are trying to implore the syrian rebels to learn. the officials are cautioning the syrian

Article 8 - obama again tips the scales toward caution on syria
although mr. obama has gotten virtually no credit for that achievement, the lesson of the episode is hardly lost on him. on thursday, asked about military action in syria, he dwelled on the role of diplomacy in an effective strategy against the group, the islamic state in iraq and syria. “the issue with respect to syria is not simply a military issue, it’s also a political issue,” mr. obama said at the white house. “it’s also an issue that involves all the sunni states in the region and sunni leadership recognizing that this cancer that has developed is one that they have to be just as invested in defeating as we are.” some longtime critics of the president said they were encouraged by his restraint. his comments, they said, recognized that airstrikes alone would not be sufficient to defeat isis in syria. it will require a ground component, which can succeed only if the united states and its allies strengthen the moderate opposition in syria. that, in turn, will require persuading saudi arabia, qatar, the united arab emirates and others to coordinate their support for the rebels. for now, the outside support goes to several groups, including radical ones, like the nusra front, which the state department classifies as a terrorist organization. mr. obama’s comments do not mean that he would refrain from striking isis leaders in syria if the united states got intelligence on their whereabouts. he could give that

Title: with isolation over, syria is happy to talk
Content: mr. mekdad even hinted that syria might have hopes of turning the tables and driving a wedge between the arabs and the united states on the question of iran’s nuclear capabilities. “i think the west is more concerned about the iranian nuclear file than the arabs,” mr. mekdad said. “i think our brothers in saudi arabia understand that the threat is not iran, it is the israeli nuclear capability. this policy of double standards is making all arabs angry.” those sentiments are not likely to be welcomed any more warmly in the saudi capital than they are in washington . but for the moment, the syrian leadership is not feeling any real pressure to detach itself from iran. in fact, a number of syrian analysts have sounded a triumphant note in recent weeks, suggesting that after emerging intact from the deep freeze of the bush years, syria has more power to dictate the terms of its new relationship with washington. at the same time, some figures in the syrian leadership are said to be uneasy about the new outreach from the obama administration, which may prove to be less advantageous than it seems. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. “there are some here who miss the bush administration, because at least with them you knew where you stood,” said one syrian analyst who is close to the leadership, but spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to come under scrutiny for exposing differences of opinion. “with obama, the american demands have not really changed, but there is an impression of a new era and an expectation of new results from us.” nevertheless, there may be real opportunities for diplomatic progress, in part because some of the issues that divided syria and the united states in recent years appear to have subsided. last year’s doha accord resolved the political crisis, at least for now, in lebanon , where the united states long accused syria of playing a destabilizing role. syria and saudi arabia are also said to have reached an agreement not to interfere in the lebanese parliamentary elections in june, and syria and lebanon have established formal diplomatic ties. in iraq , syria’s goals are now similar to those of the united states, analysts say. despite its history of enabling jihadists to fight american troops in iraq, syria is now contemplating an imminent american withdrawal and is keenly aware that it might itself become a jihadist target, especially if it concludes any sort of peace deal with israel. “syria increasingly sees an interest in iraqi stability,” said

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US's Middle East interventions have led to a geopolitical disaster, with the rise of Sunni extremists and the failure of effective strategies. The Obama administration's approach has been criticized for its lack of coordination with Iran, despite shared interests in Iraq and Syria.

A secret alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia is emerging, which could complicate US diplomacy in the region. Iranian officials have expressed concerns about the potential for an American occupation of Iraq, fearing it could be a platform for projecting power throughout the region.

The US has been criticized for its handling of the Syrian civil war, with some experts attributing the divergence in stories about the Khorasan plot to the Obama administration's development of a new narrative. The administration is instead focusing on diplomacy and coordination with Gulf states to increase international pressure on Syria's president.

Recent interventions in Yemen have led to criticism of US support for the Saudi-led coalition, which has been accused of reckless military operations. The Islamic State has also become increasingly involved in the conflict in Yemen.

The US's tendency to intervene in crises around the world remains strong, despite lessons learned from failed nation-building efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Plans are underway to remodel Syria's society, security, economy, and political system, despite opposition from the Syrian opposition.

President Obama has expressed caution on military action in Syria, emphasizing the need for diplomacy and coordination with Sunni states in the region. His comments recognize that airstrikes alone will not be sufficient to defeat ISIS in Syria, and that a ground component requires strengthening the

Article 1 - what we know and don’t know about the trump-russia dossier
■ the memos contain unsubstantiated claims that russian officials tried to obtain influence over mr. trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals. they also claim that the trump campaign met with russian operatives to discuss the russians’ hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the democratic national committee and from mrs. clinton’s campaign chairman, john d. podesta. ■ fusion gps and mr. steele shared the memos first with their clients, and later with the f.b.i. and multiple journalists at the new york times and elsewhere. the memos, totaling about 35 pages, also reached a number of members of congress. ■ last week, when the f.b.i., c.i.a. and national security agency gave a classified report on the russian hacking, leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to mr. obama, mr. trump and congressional leaders, they attached a two-page summary of the unverified allegations in the memos. got a confidential news tip? the new york times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. what we don’t know ■ whether any of the claims in the memos are true. american intelligence agencies have not confirmed them, and mr. trump has said they are a complete fabrication. in addition, one specific allegation — that mr. trump’s lawyer michael cohen met with a russian official in prague in august or september — has been denied by

Article 2 - f.b.i. chief says leak on qaeda plot is being investigated
the prosecutions have had strong bipartisan support from congress but have been sharply criticized by press advocates as misguided crackdowns on whistle-blowers. on wednesday, members of the senate committee endorsed the idea of the investigation. “regardless of political consequences, i hope that you get to the bottom of it,” said senator charles e. grassley, republican of iowa, the ranking member of the committee. “our international partners have been wary of cooperating with us in the wake of the wikileaks affair, in which our ability to keep their confidence was severely damaged.” the a.p. said it learned of the bomb plot two weeks ago but agreed not to publish an article about it in response to pleas from the white house and the central intelligence agency because an intelligence operation tied to the plot was under way. after the operation was completed, the a.p. published an article about how the qaeda affiliate in yemen planned to deploy a suicide bomber with an underwear bomb to blow up a plane headed to the united states. it was later revealed that the underwear bomb was smuggled out of yemen by a double agent working for saudi arabia. mr. grassley asked mr. mueller about the impact of the leak on the united states’ ability to work with its allies. “my hope is that it’ll have minimal impact,” mr. mueller said. “and i know that there are — discussions are going on with our partners overseas to make certain that whatever impact there is is

Article 3 - the tangled threads of russia-gate
exclusive: once a washington groupthink takes hold, as it has in the fervent belief about russia-gate, respect for facts and logic fly out the window since all these important people can’t be wrong, writes robert parry. by robert parry a curious feature about the russia-gate “scandal” is that its proponents ignore the growing number of moments when their evidence undercuts their narrative. instead, they press ahead toward a predetermined destination in much the way that true-believing conspiracy theorists are known to do. for instance, the new york times ran a story on monday, entitled “operative offered trump campaign access to putin,” detailing how a conservative operative “told a trump adviser that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between donald j. trump and vladimir v. putin, the russian president, according to an email sent to the trump campaign” — and apparently described to the times by a helpful source on capitol hill. the times quoted the email from national rifle association member paul erickson to trump campaign adviser rick dearborn as saying, “putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with mr. trump. … [putin] wants to extend an invitation to mr. trump to visit him in the kremlin before the election.” an nra conference in louisville, kentucky, was supposed to be the location for the “first contact” between the russians and the trump campaign, according to the email. the

Article 5 - inquiry is sharply critical of intelligence agencies for failing to prevent attacks
he singled out the director of central intelligence, george j. tenet; the director of the national security agency, michael v. hayden; the f.b.i. director who vacated his post in 2001, louis j. freeh; and other senior officials for failing to do more before sept. 11. ''the u.s. intelligence community,'' mr. shelby wrote, ''would have been far better prepared for sept. 11 but for the failure of successive agency leaders to work wholeheartedly to overcome the institutional and cultural obstacles to interagency cooperation and coordination that bedeviled counterterrorism efforts before the attacks.'' he added that the leaders whom he named were ''not responsible for the disaster of sept. 11, of course, for that infamy belongs to al qaeda's 19 suicide hijackers and the terrorist infrastructure that supported them.'' ''as the leaders of the united states intelligence community, however,'' he added, ''these officials failed in significant ways to ensure that this country was as prepared as it could have been.'' mr. tenet came in for some of the most pointed criticism. mr. shelby suggested that after mr. tenet issued a memo in 1998 saying the united states was ''at war'' with al qaeda, the c.i.a. director did not follow up by aggressively seeking additional money and resources for the fight against the terrorist organization. ''one of the great unanswered questions of our sept. 11 inquiry,

Article 6 - save the endangered whistle-blower
if ever government whistle-blowers needed protection from official retaliation it is now, in the secrecy-obsessed bush administration. federal employees daring to disclose fraud and abuse in their bureaucracies have been under virtual siege, isolated as pariahs and shipped off under gag orders to lesser jobs in far-off places. appeals to court review under the 17-year-old whistle-blower protection act have proved fruitless, with the supreme court ruling in may that workers have no right to first amendment protection when they warn lawmakers and taxpayers of government waste and folly. the ruling has thrown the issue back into the lap of congress. fortunately, there is enough anger emerging on both sides of the aisle to raise hopes for remedial legislation. the senate has unanimously approved an amendment to close loopholes and spell out whistle-blowers’ rights in more forceful detail for the courts. it is attached to a pending military bill, with proponents working for comparably tough legislation to be accepted by the house. the outcome is not certain. the justice department has been opposed to strengthening the law, and a countermove is afoot to give the administration even more power to prosecute whistle-blowers as leakers of official secrets. the coming showdown is a chance for electioneering incumbents to take a stand against the administration’s mania for foiling the public’s right to government transparency. the best display of congressional intent would be for lawmakers to not just reaffirm the 1989 law but to extend it to

Article 7 - f.b.i. inquiry on 9/11 leak upsets lawmakers on committees
the f.b.i. has interviewed dozens of members of the house and senate intelligence committees and asked them to submit to lie detector tests as part of an effort to learn who leaked classified material to reporters in the wake of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, congressional officials said today. but a number of the lawmakers on the committees have refused to take the polygraph tests and have voiced uneasiness over the constitutional precedent of being investigated by the agency they oversee, the officials said. ranit schmelzer, a spokeswoman for senator tom daschle of south dakota, the majority leader, said the inquiry had provoked ''grave concerns about the constitutional separation of powers issues raised by having one branch of government administering a polygraph to employees of another branch.'' still, ms. schmelzer said, the matter ''is between the house and senate intelligence committees and the justice department.'' advertisement continue reading the main story the committee had asked that the f.b.i. conduct the investigation into accusations of leaks of secret information by someone affiliated with the committee and, ms. schmelzer said, it was up to the bureau and the committee officials to develop appropriate guidelines. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred.

Article 8 - mining of data prompted fight over u.s. spying
if the dispute chiefly involved data mining, rather than eavesdropping, mr. gonzales’ defenders may maintain that his narrowly crafted answers, while legalistic, were technically correct. but members of the senate intelligence committee, who have been briefed on the program, called the testimony deceptive. “i’ve had the opportunity to review the classified matters at issue here, and i believe that his testimony was misleading at best,” said senator russ feingold, democrat of wisconsin, joining three other democrats in calling thursday for a perjury investigation of mr. gonzales. “this has gone on long enough,” mr. feingold said. “it is time for a special counsel to investigate whether criminal charges should be brought.” the senators’ comments, along with those of other members of congress briefed on the program, suggested that they considered the eavesdropping and data mining so closely tied that they were part of a single program. both activities, which ordinarily require warrants, were started without court approval as the bush administration intensified counterterrorism efforts soon after the sept. 11 attacks. a half-dozen officials and former officials interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity, in part because unauthorized disclosures about the classified program are already the subject of a criminal investigation. some of the officials said the 2004 dispute involved other issues in addition to the data mining, but would not provide details. they would not say whether the differences were over how the databases were

knowledge and experience counts when it comes to negotiating restricted stock units % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) boston ma, april 29, 2015 — attorney robert a. adelson (www.executiveemploymentattorney.com) is an expert negotiator when it comes to executive compensation. a key component of these negotiations are often restricted stock units, commonly referred to as rsu stock, or simply restricted stock. rsu stock is a valuable asset for prospective hires who want a piece of the company, as well as venture capitalists trying to hire or retain technical talent, particularly in biotech, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. “big talent want’s big money,” said attorney adelson, “in startups, however, money is sometimes tough to come by. vcs know that hiring the right big talent will help them grow and make more money.” according to attorney adelson, by offering restricted stock units, employers can offer prized employees equity value in the company. this helps keep them from moving for greater pay. likewise, an equity-based signing bonus in the form of restricted stock is a creative way to bring an executive on board without spending huge amounts of cash. “rsu stock can lower tax costs. negotiating the vesting of the stock correctly can also go far in helping retain the employee over time,” attorney adelson said. to learn more about restricted stock and restricted stock units, visit www.executiveemploymentattorney.com about

Article 1 - ovitz, hollywood giant of a few years ago, comes on hard times
what went wrong for mr. ovitz? according to rivals in talent management and to entertainment industry executives, mr. ovitz miscalculated the high rate of failure in the television business -- especially in today's shifting market, and spent huge amounts of money on deals and expenses without creating a sturdier foundation at the company. mr. ovitz has lost his powerful perch, at least for the moment, and over the years he has made numerous enemies who are almost eager to see him fail. no power broker in hollywood matches mr. ovitz for the number of powerful people -- whether it is michael d. eisner, the chairman of the walt disney company; david geffen, the entertainment industry billionaire; ron meyer, the president and chief operating officer of universal studios, or the partners at creative artists agency -- who actively dislike him. his financial straits are indeed embarrassing for mr. ovitz, a founder of the creative artists agency, less than a decade ago hollywood's most powerful talent agency. in recent years, he has suffered highly publicized blows -- including his dismissal after one year from the presidency of walt disney, even with a $100 million severance package. there have also been failed efforts to bring a professional football team back to los angeles and to become a broadway powerhouse by gaining control of the theatrical production company livent, but then asserting that the company was riddled with accounting fraud. the former executives of livent

Article 2 - disney said to weigh dividing top posts
but the separation ''is not a silver bullet,'' said patrick mcgurn, special counsel for institutional shareholder services, the influential proxy adviser that recommended that shareholders withhold votes from mr. eisner in the election and that the company split the posts. ''for investors, the list of complaints is longer than that.'' because mr. eisner is running unopposed, he is not in danger of losing his job. but if there is any question about how concerned disney investors are, more than 1,000 are expected to be here to attend the annual meeting. on tuesday, hundreds of shareholders lined up around the block at loews hotel to get inside a meeting called by the two former directors leading the campaign to oust mr. eisner --roy e. disney, the nephew of the company's founder, and stanley p. gold. ''what we do and say here is only a step in the process,'' mr. disney told the more than 800 people who filled the ballroom, some holding babies on their laps, all of them giving mr. disney a standing ovation. ''patience, as you are being taught, is a virtue.'' as little as a month ago, few analysts or institutional investors expected that mr. disney and mr. gold would muster such attention for their save disney campaign. indeed it was not until steven p. jobs, the chief executive of pixar animation studios, ended its partnership negotiations

Article 3 - out to shake up music, often with sharp words
as tunecore has grown, it has also served as a pulpit for mr. price to criticize the ways of the music business. through aggressive posts on the company’s blog with titles like “how they legally steal your money,” and occasional outbursts at industry conferences, he has established himself as a particularly vocal gadfly, denouncing opaque accounting systems and sometimes hurling insults at companies he dislikes. mr. price, a trim 45-year-old who speaks so rapidly he sometimes seems to be on fast-forward, says his actions are a form of advocacy in line with tunecore’s original mission of serving musicians. “the plan,” he said in an interview last week, “was to start a company that righted a wrong.” mr. price has inserted himself into some of the most contentious issues in the music business, like the legal obligations of streaming services and the complex mechanisms for paying royalties. but his excitable manner — and his tendency to portray business disputes as pitched battles between right and wrong — do not always endear him to his colleagues. “typically when you hear people talk about how artists need to get paid, usually some party is posturing for political positioning,” said michael robertson, a digital music pioneer who has also fought the industry with his companies mp3.com and mp3tunes. “jeff has done a fantastic job with tunecore. but i think his bombastic style drives people crazy and doesn’t always serve him well.” mr. price

Article 4 - as a private lawyer, miers left little for the public record
most of the cases ms. miers handled were settled out of court, leaving little for the public record. according to the congressional research service, ms. miers has been counsel of record in 22 cases that were litigated. in 1975, she was the court-appointed counsel for a man seeking to overturn his 1960 conviction for transporting counterfeit securities across state lines. she lost that appeal. in 1981, ms. miers advocated on behalf of a woman seeking social security disability benefits. the court turned her down. in 2000, she successfully represented gov. george w. bush when a group of texas voters sued to block the state's electoral college representatives from voting for both mr. bush, then a presidential contender, and his vice presidential choice, dick cheney. but the majority of ms. miers's time as a lawyer with the dallas law firm locke liddell & sapp was spent counseling clients in business matters. she has represented the walt disney company and sungard in contract disputes, microsoft in a consumer class-action case, and investors in a real estate transaction that soured. in 1998, ms. miers represented disney enterprises in a dispute with esprit finance, which had entered into a contract to promote a disney concert tour in mexico. the financing fell through, and esprit sued disney in texas state court; disney lost and appealed, arguing that texas did not have jurisdiction over

Article 5 - facing a battle, disney's chief is known to fight back, hard
hollywood executives said that mr. eisner was bracing for a takeover bid by comcast, given the cable company's ambitions. but he has had much to distract him lately -- including mr. disney's campaign to stir shareholder discontent and the move by pixar animation studios to find another distributor for its hit animated films. besides comcast's bid, mr. eisner was hit wednesday with the news that institutional shareholder services, a research group that advises big holders on proxy votes, was recommending that investors withhold their votes for mr. eisner's re-election to the disney board at the company's annual meeting next month. the group derided his close relationships with board members and argued for separating the roles of chairman and chief executive. disney responded with a statement saying that the group's conclusions regarding mr. eisner were unjustified. the critique could gird mr. eisner's critics on wall street. ''one thing that works against disney is they have very little defense mechanism here,'' said brad ruderman, an investment fund manager in beverly hills, calif. ''they don't have a succession plan. there's very, very little to fight this with respect to the large shareholders. they will vote for the highest bidder. what will disney do to fend this off?'' mr. eisner has overcome many threats in the past, sometimes consolidating his leadership by making gestures toward change. not long ago,

Article 6 - bid to upend disney’s deal for maker studios falls short
bid to upend disney’s deal for maker studios falls short los angeles — an oddball maneuver by relativity media to break up the pending nuptials of the youtube-focused maker studios and the walt disney company ended on monday almost as fast as it started. relativity, a privately held midsize company with interests in film, music, television and sports, made it known late sunday night that it had submitted an offer of roughly $1 billion for maker, mostly in stock. disney, the world’s largest entertainment conglomerate, had announced a deal last month to acquire maker, a supplier of online video, for up to $950 million, mostly in cash. disney executives did little more than roll their eyes on monday, noting that the deal was sealed, and maker ultimately released a statement saying as much. “the agreement has been approved by maker studios’ board of directors and the majority of its shareholders and is expected to close in the next few weeks.” so relativity gets nothing – except for a publicity pop and new speculation in hollywood that it may again be considering an initial public offering. “we made a compelling offer and believe maker studios, its employees and its roster of talent would have greatly benefited from relativity’s platform,” relativity said in a statement in response to the maker statement. also on monday, a california judge rejected a legal effort by danny zappin, a maker founder, and three other individuals to block the sale of maker to

Article 7 - for $600 a week, screen-side seats to lawsuit involving disney
the shareholder lawsuit over the $140 million severance package that the walt disney company paid to its former president, michael s. ovitz, is sure to be one of the most watched trials in recent hollywood history. for those who cannot afford to spend a month in georgetown, del., where the trial is set to begin next monday, chancellor william b. chandler iii of delaware chancery court has agreed that the proceedings can shown live over the internet at www.courtroomconnect.com. but access for business users comes at a price -- $600 a week for the audio and video as well as online access to documents and slides presented in court. louis goldberg, president of courtroom connect, said that reporters, lawyers and other interested parties would be able to watch live audio and video streaming of the testimony. the witness list includes michael d. eisner, the disney chief executive; george j. mitchell, the chairman; the dissident former directors stanley p. gold and roy e. disney, the nephew of the founder; and the former director and actor sydney poitier, who starred in ""to sir, with love."" advertisement continue reading the main story mr. ovitz is expected to be among the first witnesses, and the trial is sure to dredge up old information that is embarrassing to mr. eisner. some communications between mr. eisner and the board as well as documents related to mr

Article 8 - correction; music executive is still in control of tvt records
beyond the inaccuracies arising from the article's mistaken premises, there were also several other factual errors, which are corrected today in an editors' note on page a2. as the article reported, mr. gottlieb has been involved in more than 40 lawsuits since 1991. but he appears as the plaintiff in only one-third of the cases listing his name or his companies in online federal and state court databases. and of those, one was his successful case against island def jam. five were related to the music industry's copyright lawsuits against the internet file-swapping services napster and mp3.com. and at least five were cross-claims in lawsuits where mr. gottlieb or his companies were defendants, including the prudential matter. ''in the record industry, that doesn't sound to me like being litigious,'' said john c. coffee jr., a law professor at columbia and an expert in corporate law. ''the key question with respect to litigiousness is the purpose of the lawsuits. if you're suing to collect a debt that is owed to you, or to enforce a contract, you're not being litigious.'' for his part, mr. gottlieb said in a written statement yesterday: ''tvt's success would be impossible without maintaining cordial professional relationships all around. thankfully, during 18 years in the business tvt's significant litigations have been few and far between, and -- as in the $132

Title: ovitz defends his brief record at disney
Content: georgetown, del., oct. 28 - michael s. ovitz, the former president of the walt disney company testifying in a shareholder lawsuit here, spent thursday challenging accusations of conflicts of interest and failures during his brief tenure, lecturing on how hollywood worked. ""in our world people do things that are very unorthodox and that this court has not seen before,"" mr. ovitz said. but mr. ovitz's defense in chancery court did little to deter steven g. schulman, the lawyer for disney shareholders, who are suing over the board's handling of mr. ovitz's hiring in 1995 and the $140 million severance deal he got 14 months later. mr. schulman questioned whether mr. ovitz fully apprised disney executives of his continuing financial relationship with the creative artists agency, the talent agency he co-founded and later left for disney. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. schulman said mr. ovitz earned $27.9 million in 1996 from his ongoing relationship with creative artists, which was reorganized in 1995 when he joined disney.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Recent articles have shed light on various issues in the entertainment industry. 

Ovitz, a Hollywood giant, is facing hard times due to miscalculating the high rate of failure in television and overspending without creating a sturdier foundation at his company. He has lost powerful allies, including Michael Eisner, David Geffen, and Ron Meyer.

Disney's CEO, Michael Eisner, is under scrutiny as the company considers separating the roles of chairman and chief executive. Institutional shareholder services recommended that investors withhold their votes for Eisner's re-election due to close relationships with board members.

Tunecore's Jeff Price has been vocal about criticizing the music business, denouncing opaque accounting systems and hurling insults at companies he dislikes. However, his excitable manner may not always endear him to colleagues.

Karen Miers, a private lawyer, left little for the public record during her time as counsel of record in 22 cases. She successfully represented George W. Bush in a lawsuit but lost other appeals.

Disney's chief executive is known to fight back against threats, including a potential takeover bid by Comcast. However, the company lacks a defense mechanism and may struggle to fend off large shareholders.

A bid to upend Disney's deal for Maker Studios fell short after Relativity Media submitted an offer of roughly $1 billion for the company. The deal was sealed, and Maker ultimately released a statement confirming its approval.

The shareholder lawsuit over Michael Ovitz's severance package is set

(in citing neuroscience, the supreme court may have been guilty of naïve dualism: did it really need brain evidence to conclude that adolescents are immature?)…naïve dualism is misguided. “was the cause psychological or biological?” is the wrong question when assigning responsibility for an action. all psychological states are also biological ones. a better question is “how strong was the relation between the cause (whatever it happened to be) and the effect?” if, hypothetically, only 1 percent of people with a brain malfunction (or a history of being abused) commit violence, ordinary considerations about blame would still seem

Article 1 - official quits in japan after article on mob ties
tokyo — japan’s justice minister resigned on tuesday after an uproar over his past ties to members of organized crime, putting further pressure on prime minister yoshihiko noda to call national elections. the minister, keishu tanaka, appointed three weeks ago in a cabinet reshuffle, resigned for health reasons, the government’s top spokesman, osamu fujimura, said at a news conference on tuesday. but the resignation came after days of haranguing from opposition lawmakers over a magazine report that said he had associated with a japanese organized-crime syndicate. mr. tanaka acknowledged that he had helped with the wedding of an organized-crime member three decades ago and that he had attended a party hosted by a mobster boss. but he initially refused to resign, saying he had been unaware of their mob connections at the time. photo mr. tanaka had also been accused of accepting political donations from a foreign resident in japan, in violation of japanese law. amid the mounting accusations, he checked into a tokyo hospital on friday, complaining of chest pains, according to local media reports. he was discharged on monday. advertisement continue reading the main story connections between japan’s notorious gangsters and parts of japan’s political and business elite were not uncommon in the past, though a recent crackdown on organized crime has made such links far riskier.

(image courtesy of carl takei) carl takei for the los angeles times carl higbie, a prominent supporter of donald trump , said recently that the mass internment of japanese-americans during world war ii was a “precedent” for the president-elect's plans to create a registry for immigrants from muslim countries. he said the plan would be legal, that it would “hold constitutional muster.” that claim betrays a misreading of history. it rests on a wartime supreme court decision that was based on falsehoods and suppressed evidence, a decision that is regarded as a stain on american jurisprudence. in february 1942, shortly after the japanese attack on the united states at pearl harbor, president franklin d. roosevelt issued executive order 9066. about 120,000 japanese-americans — two-thirds of them native-born u.s. citizens — had to register and report to assembly centers. they had just days to divest themselves of all they owned — their homes, farms and businesses. with just what they could carry, they were shipped off to federally run “internment

Article 3 - remembering hiroshima, and how it changed the world
after 70 years, the memory may be fading. survivors are in their 80s, and many young japanese can no longer give the dates when american atomic bombs incinerated hiroshima and nagasaki. but at every anniversary the debates resurface, as impassioned and complex as ever. there is no disputing the awesome brutality of the two bombs that killed more than 200,000 in the two cities in august 1945, most of them civilians and many in unspeakable agony. nor is there any question that the bombs opened an era in which the very survival of the human race became hostage to geopolitical disputes. the questions that remain, and can never be resolved, are whether the bombings were necessary or moral. hiroshima and nagasaki have become shrines to peace and a pacifism proclaiming that nuclear weapons are an absolute evil. tens of thousands of people joined japanese prime minister shinzo abe and the united states ambassador to japan, caroline kennedy, in hiroshima on thursday to mark the anniversary of the moment when a bomb nicknamed little boy exploded over the city. photo the commemorations, with their annual calls for nuclear disarmament, can seem placid and unambiguous. but the narrative and the politics under that surface are turbulent still. the pacific war, japan’s culpability and the bombings animate mr. abe’s politics. he has alarmed pacifist japanese with his drive to lift some postwar restrictions on japan’s

Article 4 - ‘in praise of forgetting,’ by david rieff
instead, he warns that all too often, collective memory “has led to war rather than peace . . . and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness.” for rieff, national remembrances are almost always political, sometimes imposed by victorious armies, at other times drummed up by manipulative politicians seeking to fabricate an epic past to legitimize their present-day intentions. he provides a depressing abundance of examples where toxic memories fuel atavistic hatred: among iraqis; israelis and palestinians; radical islamists across the globe; and hindu chauvinists rallied by the indian prime minister, narendra modi. this is no abstract dread for rieff, a distinguished journalist known for eviscerating american and european failures in bosnia and later for thoughtfully questioning the value of international humanitarian organizations. having been an eyewitness to yugoslavia’s collapse, he understands the grotesque realities of ethnic strife and power politics with stark clarity. he disgustedly recalls visiting a serb nationalist politician in belgrade who, as the war raged in bosnia, venerated the serbian guerrillas of world war ii, while one of his aides portentously handed rieff a piece of paper reading “1453” — the year when the ottoman empire conquered orthodox constantinople. worse, rieff worries that memory could not just spark violence, but prolong it. in order to end

Article 6 - retired japanese fighter pilot sees an old danger on the horizon
it is a warning that mr. harada fears his countrymen may soon no longer be able to hear. there are only a dwindling number of japanese left who fought in the war, which in asia began when imperial japan invaded northeastern china in 1931, and claimed tens of millions of lives over the following 14 years. in an interview after his speech, mr. harada described himself as “the last zero fighter,” or at least the last pilot still alive who flew during that aircraft’s glory days early in the war with the united states. he recounted how in dogfights, he flew close enough to his opponents to see the terror on their faces as he sent them crashing to their deaths. photo “i fought the war from the cockpit of a zero, and can still remember the faces of those i killed,” said mr. harada, who said he was able to meet and befriend some of his foes who survived the war. “they were fathers and sons, too. i didn’t hate them or even know them.” “that is how war robs you of your humanity,” he added, “by putting you in a situation where you must either kill perfect strangers or be killed by them.” mr. harada said that as he and other aging veterans pass from the scene, japan will lose more than just their war stories. he said it was his generation’s bitter experiences, and resulting aversion to war, that have kept japan firmly on a pacifist

what made things worse for japanese doctors who tried to ease the suffering of atom-bomb victims is that information about the bomb and its effects was censored by the american administration occupying japan until the early 1950s. even as readers here were shocked in 1946 by john hersey’s description of the hiroshima bomb in the new yorker, the ensuing book was banned in japan. films and photographs of the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki, as well as medical data, were confiscated by american authorities. the strength of southard’s book is that her account is remarkably free of abstractions. she is a theater director, albeit one with an m.f.a. in creative writing, and her interest in the story began in 1986, when she was hired as a translator for one of her subjects who was on a speaking tour in the united states. instead of statistics, she concentrates, like hersey, on the fates of individuals. we read about wada koichi, an 18-year-old student worker for the municipal streetcar company, as well as a 16-year-old schoolgirl named nagano etsuko, another teenage girl named do-oh mineko, a 13-year-old boy named yoshida katsuji, and several others. they were so badly disfigured by the blast that it not only took them years to recover some kind of health, but they were also hesitant to reveal themselves in public. children would cry

Title: last to surrender-no honor, just terror, now he is dead
Content: last to surrender-no honor, just terror, now he is dead (before it's news) by major van harl usaf ret last to surrender-no honor just terror now he is dead ammoland gun news wisconsin --(ammoland.com)- the history channel ran a documentary about ww ii, japanese army 2nd lieutenant hiroo onoda. he was the japanese solider who spent 30 years hiding in the hills of the philippine island, of lubang. he was a 23-year-old officer who had been trained in guerrilla warfare. his first combat assignment was in december of 1944 to lubang island. this was not some combat seasoned japanese army officer who had spent years fighting the war. this was by his own admission a young man who had problems with authority figures and following the rules. however if the orders were to his liking, he was fanatical about blindly following rules. when the second world war ended, because no one sat onoda down and explained the fighting had officially stopped, onoda took it upon himself to continue the struggle. he started out with three other japanese soldiers. one ran away and surrendered after almost five years of living in the jungle. the other two were killed in firefights with filipinos. in some of the more politely written information i found, onoda lived on coconuts & bananas and he killed an occasional filipino cow. what he really did was develop a thirty-year reign of terror on the inhabitants of lubang island. he raided the local villages, stealing what he could carry off and burning what he could not. he kept this up even after he was the last of the four japanese, left on the island. it is believed he killed between 30 and 50 local filipinos and wounded up to 100. one filipino tells how his brother was shot while gathering coconuts up in a tree. after the man fell to the ground onoda hacked him to death. he finally gave it up in 1974 after his old army commander came to the jungle and read an order for onoda to surrender. this way, onoda did not have to take the personal responsibility for his actions. someone else made him give up. he stated “i have never regretted anything i have done,” apparently to include the killing of up to 50 innocent civilian filipinos. of course onoda was part of the army of japan that brutally invaded and occupied the philippines. now having president ferdinand marcos of the philippines pardon onoda right a way, for the sake of relations with japan (read money), went a long way to excuse the atrocities of onoda. onoda lived on a cattle ranch in brazil. he believes japan is a puppet-state and their current constitution was forced onto that nation at gunpoint. hiroo onoda you know what, it probably was and there are good reasons for that? approximately one third of the us

Article 1 - school choice lawsuit roundup
school choice lawsuit roundup (before it's news) jason bedrick school choice advocates have been winning in the halls of state legislatures and in the court of public opinion, so opponents have taken to the courts of law. since the u.s. supreme court ruled in zelman v. simmons-harris (2002) that school vouchers are consistent with the first amendment’s establishment clause, opponents of choice have been scrambling to find novel reasons to challenge school choice programs. here’s a brief summary of school choice lawsuits around the nation: 1) in louisiana, the u.s. department of justice has sued to halt the state’s school voucher program, arguing that it hurts the desegregation effort. the doj’s already weak case was further undermined by a new study released today showing that school choice actually improves integration. since 90 percent of the voucher recipients are black, the doj’s lawsuit would have the effect of keeping low-income blacks from attending the schools of their choice. earlier this year, louisiana’s state supreme court ruled that the voucher program was unconstitutionally funded, but otherwise left the program intact. the governor and state legislators adjusted the funding mechanism in response. 2) two days ago, a group of activists in oklahoma sued the state over its special needs voucher program, arguing that it violates the state constitution’s ban on using public funds at religious schools. last year, the state supreme court tossed out a challenge to the program by public school districts,

Article 2 - “poverty is the problem” with our public schools, not teachers’ unions (interview)
“poverty is the problem” with our public schools, not teachers’ unions (interview) (before it's news) education expert diane ravitch and new york schoolteacher brian jones discuss the real problems with–and real solutions for–our public school system. amy goodman, juan gonzalez alternet juan gonzalez: as children across the nation head back to school, we turn now to a number of recent developments in education news. here in new york, nearly 780 employees of the city’s education department will lose their jobs by october in the largest layoff at a single agency since michael bloomberg became mayor in 2002. i reported in today’s daily news that those layoffs are going to be hitting particularly hard the poorest school districts in the city. the layoffs stem from budget cuts to schools, which have occurred in each of the last four years. the cuts have cost more than 2,000 full-time public school teachers their assignments and now threaten the job security of more than 400 school aides and 82 parent coordinators. at last month’s “save our schools” rally in washington, d.c., education author jonathan kozol criticized the drive toward fewer teachers and larger classes. jonathan kozol: class size is soaring in the poorest schools. i walk into classes with 35, 40, 42 children packed into a single room. originality? forget it. creativity? forget it. critical

Article 3 - despite house action, debate over ‘no child left behind’ goes nowhere
despite house action, debate over ‘no child left behind’ goes nowhere (before it's news) after years of inaction on rewriting the nation’s centerpiece legislation governing public schools, the republican-controlled house of representatives on friday passed “the student success act” by a mostly partisan vote of 221-207 – despite a veto threat from the white house. contrary to the legislation’s grandiose title, very little in the bill directly addresses the needs of students at all – other than some provisions related to homeless students and schools affected by the presence of the federal government. and nowhere does it propose what “success” for the nation’s students should look like and how our country can know when we’re realizing success for more of our youngest citizens. the bill is being peddled by republicans as “a better approach to k-12 education,” but many of the provisions continue the current emphasis on using high-stakes testing to evaluate teachers and to grade schools. as has been the tendency in education policy, the emphasis on raising test scores is generously seasoned with the language of “effectiveness,” while none of the policy directly addresses what effective teachers and schools actually do and how that can be supported, sustained and spread. the bill’s emphasis on assessment is never balanced with attention to curriculum and instruction, as if the stern hand of accountability will magically take care of all the other aspects of schooling that are necessary for real success. a teacher’s ability “to teach” is assumed to be wholly and

(by the way, how many americans are aware that the heritage foundation which is leading the parent bandwagon in opposition to the cc standards is at the same time leading the tax-funded school choice bandwagon? do they know that the heritage foundation drafted the north american free trade agreement (nafta) which has robbed americans of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, and which calls for tax-funded school choice for workforce training?) the anti-common core diversion has succeeded in keeping americans from focusing on the real issue - the trojan horse - loss of elected representation through publicly-funded school choice and charters with unelected councils (soviet form of government/regionalism). note: some charter schools are teaching religion. isn’t that unconstitutional? do americans really want to pay their education taxes to have a charter school teach religious beliefs? and not even have an elected official to whom they

school district in north carolina accused of discrimination % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) a north carolina school district has been accused of discriminating against latino students, and formal complaint has been filed with the u.s. department of education. the complaint, filed by the southern poverty law center (splc), followed a letter sent to durham public schools from the center. the letter stated that latino students do not “feel welcome” in dps, which is around 20 percent latino. when the center received a “vague” and seemingly uncaring response from dps it countered by contacting federal officials. though based in montgomery, alabama, the splc filed suit on behalf of durham school district’s more than 6,000 students and families with limited english proficiency. splc said that in one instance, a teacher at durham’s northern high school slammed a latino student against the wall and told the student, “go back to your own country.” the center also said another teacher fired a racial slur at a latino student. the district is also being scolded for having only three spanish-language interpreters. pilar rocha, director of durham’s largest immigrant organization, el centro hispano, said she is not surprised that the district is under investigation for discrimination, considering the number of complaints she’s heard from the parents of the schools’ students. published in educacion read more at hispanically speaking

why and how democratic candidates should talk about education in 2012 (before it's news) so the “general election has begun” proclaims the hill, and the exhortations from the punditry are for candidates to either, shore up their base or move to the center. one interesting bit of advice, coming from more than one source, is for the candidates to “talk about education.” recent research results from the college board strongly suggest that advice may not be a bad idea. but if democratic candidates want to take that advice to heart, they need to develop more effective education talking points than what’s currently being conveyed. education is “top tier” in 2012 election according to the college board survey, “education is a top issue for voters in this year’s elections.” interesting data nuggets available in the pdf (link above) include: • 67 percent of the responders say education will be extremely important to them personally in this year’s elections for president and congress. • education ranks behind jobs and the economy (82 percent extremely important) and is on par with government spending (69 percent), health care (67 percent), and the federal budget deficit (64 percent). • three out of four voters say having a post-secondary degree or credential is important to achieving success in the workplace. • those most likely to be “education voters” in the 2012 elections are african americans (91 percent), hispanics (81 percent), democrats (79 percent), and

before his inauguration, lawyers hired by mr. trump argued that the clause “does not forbid fair-market-value transactions with foreign officials,” like paying for hotel rooms. they also said mr. trump would donate profits from foreign governments’ patronage to the united states treasury. but the lawsuit, filed by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a liberal government corruption watchdog, contends that the clause bars such transactions, too, and that donating profits does not solve the problem. it wants the judge to stop mr. trump’s businesses from accepting such payments. it is not clear that judge abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause’s meaning. first, she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge. the group argued that it had standing to sue because keeping track of foreign payments to mr. trump’s businesses imposed a “significant diversion and depletion of its time, resources and effort.” it cited a 1982 housing discrimination case as precedent for the idea that an advocacy organization can sue over conduct that drains its resources. but several scholars on monday noted that congress had enacted a statute that made it easier to challenge housing discrimination, but not emoluments clause violations. josh blackman, a conservative law professor at south texas college of law houston, argued in a lengthy blog entry that a “self-inflicted” injury – like choosing to track certain conduct – is generally not sufficient to establish court standing. ouch. trump’s d.c. hotel is losing money. the

''there's been more federal regulations, more regulatory notices, than previous administrations,'' said trent duffy, a white house spokesman, though he attributed much of that to the new rules dealing with domestic security. scott mcclellan, the chief white house spokesman, said of the changes, ''the president's common-sense policies reflect the values of america, whether it is cracking down on corporate wrongdoing or eliminating burdensome regulations to create jobs.'' some leaders of advocacy groups argue that the public preoccupation with war and terrorism has allowed the administration to push through changes that otherwise would have provoked an outcry. carl pope, the executive director of the sierra club, says he does not think the administration could have succeeded in rewriting so many environmental rules, for example, if the public's attention had not been focused on national security issues. ''the effect of the administration's concentration on war and terror has been to prevent the public from focusing on these issues,'' mr. pope said. ''now, when i hold focus groups with the general public and tell them what has been done, they exclaim, 'how could this have happened without me knowing about it?''' the administration has often been stymied in its efforts to pass major domestic initiatives in congress. even when both houses have been under republican control, senate democrats, using parliamentary rules, have been able to block legislation eagerly sought by the white house and business groups, including bills on energy, bankruptcy and medical malpractice. so

Article 8 - grunts on help desks seek respect
companies that do not take the clashes between the two groups seriously could end up paying a steep price, said calvin sun, founder of technology horizons, a consulting firm in paoli, pa., that trains technical-support workers. level 1 technicians might be tempted to take out their frustrations on customers, he said, and their already sagging morale could sink even farther. these front-line workers, who make about $8 to $12 an hour, typically have little training and work long days. in addition to dealing with irate customers, many are under the gun by supervisors who monitor their calls and keep track of how much time they take to resolve problems. as a result, according to steve cain, benchmarking director for the help desk practice at the gartner group inc. in stamford, conn., their turnover rate is close to 70 percent a year, one of the highest for any job category. what really galls some of them are signs of incompetence from their supposed masters. gianmarco rossi, a level 1 employee for a contractor in orlando, fla., recalled being unable to solve a customer's cable-modem problem, so he tried to forward the call. but the level 2 technician refused to take it and instead proposed an endless stream of solutions, none of which worked.

Article 1 - mid-level solar flare emitted by the sun
mid-level solar flare emitted by the sun (before it's news) nasa the sun emitted a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 1:32 pm edt on may 3, 2013. solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however — when intense enough — they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel. this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, and the radio blackout for this flare has already subsided. this flare is classified as an m5.7-class flare. m-class flares are the weakest flares that can still cause some space weather effects near earth. increased numbers of flares are quite common at the moment, as the sun’s normal 11-year activity cycle is ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in late 2013. — on the net: redorbit.com offers science, space, technology, health news, videos, images and reference information. for the latest science news, space news, technology news, health news visit redorbit.com frequently. learn something new every day.\” source: http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1112838180/mid-level-solar-flare-emitted-sun-050413/

Article 1 - a boy’s life, guided by the voice of cosmic wonder
no matter. for me, with the receipt of that letter, a circle had been closed. now it has opened again, and i have lost a distant grandfather of sorts. to the world at large arthur c. clarke was probably best known as the co-creator with stanley kubrick of the classic 1968 movie “2001: a space odyssey,” a visual tone poem featuring a malevolent computer named hal and a pair of astronauts in search of a mysterious monolith that seems to be the key to the origin and evolution of humanity. but clarke* was much more than a science fiction writer. a genuine rocket scientist, he predicted in 1945 in the journal wireless world that satellites in geosynchronous orbits would be used as “extra-terrestrial relays” for broadcasting to the earth below. the concept he had been pushing for the last few decades, of an elevator to space, might yet become a reality. as he said last fall on the 50th anniversary of sputnik, people stopped laughing at it a long time ago. to space fans and perpetual adolescents everywhere he was simply the deceptively dry voice of cosmic wonder. few writers have seemed to inhabit the cosmos, its grandeur, mystery and, yes, its ultimate coldness, with such aplomb, from the balletic spaceships and the mysterious fetus of “2001” to the jesuit astronaut in the mischievous short story “the star.” the astronaut

Article 2 - earthlike planets may be merely an illusion
in 2010, astronomers were stirred by the discovery of gliese 581g, a distant earthlike planet that orbited its star just closely enough to allow for surface water, and possibly life. but the planet’s existence was almost immediately called into question, with some researchers unable to locate it. now, a team at penn state is saying that gliese 581g and a presumed neighbor planet, gliese 581d, were simply illusions caused by the star they supposedly orbited. by measuring hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of that star (gliese 581), the researchers found that signals originally thought to be coming from planets were actually false positives caused by intense stellar magnetic activity, like sunspots. such activity can sometimes stimulate the emission of hydrogen. but all is not lost, said the study’s lead author, paul robertson, an astronomer at penn state. correcting for the magnetic activity also increased the signals for other planets long thought to orbit gliese 581. “we found evidence for stellar noise in the data that has been published previously, and when we corrected for that, we got this really nice dichotomy,” he said. “the real planets and their signals get much stronger, but these planets d and g, their signals disappeared.” though their findings, which were published in the journal science, may represent the end of the road for gliese 581g, it could yield a useful new method for identifying planets. “i’m hoping that this will provide a

Article 3 - new hall for meteorites old beyond imagining
in choosing a focal point for an exhibition, museum curators usually have a range of options. not so when dealing with a 34-ton gorilla of a rock. it is ahnighito, the largest meteorite on display at any museum, brought from greenland by the arctic explorer robert e. peary more than a century ago. wherever you put such a gigantic iron meteorite, it will attract all eyes, so it might just as well be given center stage, where it stood before. there was also a practical reason. to support such a weight, the floor at that place had already been reinforced with support posts extending into the museum basement and all the way to manhattan bedrock. (the museum also had little choice in its other recent renovation. who could imagine hanging the great blue whale replica from anywhere but the center ceiling of the hall of ocean life?) entering the meteorite hall, one is drawn to the platform where ahnighito (pronounced ah-nah-heet-o) rests. there, one's introduction to the lore and facts and importance of meteorites begins. they are pieces of planets, asteroids, comets and other materials from space. most of them come from the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter. ahnighito (the name means the tent in inuit) is itself a hefty fragment of a 200-ton meteorite that broke apart as it fell ages ago on cape york, greenland. two smaller pieces, known

Article 4 - clear skies, stars in view
earlier this month, after it finally stopped raining, dr. ben r. oppenheimer and his colleagues could be found back in haleakala, hawaii, training a high-resolution united states air force telescope equipped with an experimental coronagraph on the star omega herculis, also known as cujam. they recorded an image of the star and a dim companion star only a thousandth as bright. the astronomers regarded this feat as a promising first step forward in their project to use the coronagraph to block the light from stars and search for planets that would otherwise be lost in the glare.

Article 5 - observatory
the smaller canals are visible in the earliest marine cetacean fossils, indicating that they evolved quickly to enable the animals to tolerate the constant agile swimming movements required of an underwater existence. what's more, the researchers suggest, the development of smaller canals may have represented a point of no return in cetacean evolution, as they would not have provided enough of a sense of balance to allow much if any movement on land. a meteoric rewrite the classic meteor crater, like the one near winslow, ariz., is circular. but if a large meteor came in at a low enough angle, it would be expected to form a cluster of elongated craters as it hit and split into fragments big enough to create craters on their own. such low-angle entries are rare, and only one cluster of ''ricochet'' craters has been found, in the argentine pampas. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. check that -- no ricochet craters have been found. new research by a team of scientists from britain, the united states and other countries has shown that what had been declared in

''they seem to live for years,'' dr. kuhn said.

Article 7 - herbert gursky, 76, astrophysicist who studied source of x-rays, dies
herbert gursky, a leading space researcher for the navy who, in the 1960s, guided investigations that discovered the sources of x-rays arriving from outside the solar system, died dec. 1 in fairfax, va. he was 76. the cause was stomach cancer, his family said. until recently, dr. gursky, an astrophysicist, worked at the systems directorate of the naval research laboratory in washington overseeing experiments in solar physics and the preparation of satellites, telescopes and other sophisticated instruments launched to make observations in space. he had been acting associate director of research there. in the early 1960s, dr. gursky was a member of a pioneering scientific team at american science and engineering inc., a private research company in cambridge, mass. the team, investigating x-rays and their sources in space, developed an x-ray detector, which they launched and then monitored. the device discovered a distant star in the constellation scorpio emitting more x-rays than visible light. at the time, the sun was the only confirmed source of x-rays in the upper atmosphere. advertisement continue reading the main story in the following decades, x-rays and their stellar sources became important tools in navigation and in the timing of clocks and instruments carried on spacecraft. dr. gursky and others subsequently helped to locate scorpio through an optical telescope and ultimately to determine its makeup as two stars in rapid orbit around each other.

Article 8 - nasa launches an orbiting mystery-solver
not only are gamma rays invisible, however, but they do not penetrate the atmosphere, and thus astronomers have had to go to space to discover and study them. among the surprises found by previous satellites was that the heavens were dotted with powerful bursts lasting only a few seconds and never reappearing. chasing down these gamma ray bursts, which have been linked in some cases to the implosions of very massive stars into black holes, has become a major field of space astronomy. a survey of the sky in the 1990s by the compton gamma ray observatory, now defunct, found 271 more-permanent sources of celestial gamma radiation. some of them turned out to be quasars and pulsars, but more than two-thirds of them have never been identified. the new observatory, the largest and most sensitive yet, has two components. the first, known as the large area telescope, consists of 16 stacks with interleaved layers of silicon and tungsten that will record the direction, energy and time of arrival of each gamma ray that hits it.

Title: solar watch: a tale of 4 coronal mass ejections
Content: new findings on flares: nasa’s solar dynamics observatory (sdo), launched in february 2010, made the finding: about 1 in 7 flares experience an “aftershock.” about ninety minutes after the flare dies down, it springs to life again, producing an extra surge of extreme ultraviolet radiation. “we call it the ‘late phase flare,’” says woods. “the energy in the late phase can exceed the energy of the primary flare by as much as a factor of four.” what causes the late phase? solar flares happen when the magnetic fields of sunspots erupt—a process called “magnetic reconnection.” the late phase is thought to result when some of the sunspot’s magnetic loops re-form. a diagram prepared by team member rachel hock of the university of colorado shows how it works. the extra energy from the late phase can have a big effect on earth. extreme ultraviolet wavelengths are particularly good at heating and ionizing earth’s upper atmosphere. when our planet’s atmosphere is heated by extreme uv radiation, it puffs up, accelerating the decay of low-orbiting satellites. furthermore, the ionizing action of extreme uv can bend radio signals and disrupt the normal operation of gps. -

economy appears back on track – analyst blog (before it's news) the market likely isn’t terribly excited about this morning’s jobs report, but the report’s internals confirm the positive momentum that we have been seeing lately in a number of other economic readings. the market’s focus today clearly will be on the november non-farm payroll report, but let me briefly touch upon the favorable run of developments across the pond first. the combination of a not-so-bad u.s. jobs report and favorable developments in europe should help the market build on recent gains. with respect to europe, it is becoming clear from the pronouncements of german and french leaders that they realize the time for major decisions has come. in a major speech today, german chancellor angela merkel called for changes to the treaty documents to ensure greater fiscal integration among the 17 euro-zone countries. euro-zone leaders appear to realize now that the current situation of rising bond yields, particularly in italy, is not sustainable any longer. expectations are building that the german and french leaders will be presenting major policy proposals in the december 9 summit meeting. the emerging likely scenario at this stage appears to be that the german and french leaders will attempt to get the rest of euro-zone leaders to agree to long-term changes to the union’s framework. and the commitments for those long-term changes will give the european central bank (ecb) the cover to start playing a meaningful role in propping up the bond markets of italy and other distressed

washington (ap) — service companies continued to expand at a healthy pace last month and stepped up hiring, providing more evidence that the american economy was growing and adding jobs. the institute for supply management said wednesday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity dropped to 56 in march, from its 12-month high of 57.3 in february. any reading above 50 indicates expansion. economists said the slight decline was not troubling because the reading was still at a healthy level that points to growth. and a measure of employment rose to near a six-year high reached in january. i.s.m., a trade group of purchasing managers, surveys roughly 90 percent of american companies in all sectors outside of manufacturing. that includes retail, construction, financial services, health care and hotels. advertisement continue reading the main story separately, the payroll processor adp said the economy added 209,000 private sector jobs in march. the job gains in january and february were also revised up. the adp survey does not include government jobs.

Article 3 - trump shouldn’t focus on job growth. the new numbers show why.
advertisement economic trends trump shouldn’t focus on job growth. the new numbers show why. when the first employment report of the trump presidency was released a month ago, the administration was quick to point to the strong growth in the number of jobs in the united states in february: 235,000, in that initial estimate. it was a mistake to emphasize it, and the newest numbers, released friday, show why. it’s not just that the economy gained a mere 98,000 jobs in march, or that the labor department revised earlier months’ gains down by a combined 38,000 (though that apparent volatility alone is an argument for why government officials should be cautious in promoting any given month’s numbers). more broadly, the united states economy has arrived at a place where job gains, one of hundreds of data points released as part of the monthly report, are not really the best indicator of how things are going. when the economy is at risk of falling into a recession or struggling to grow out of one, the change in the jobs numbers really is the best single number to understand the state of the economy. while it has a lot of month-to-month statistical variance, it is a fairly reliable indicator — especially if you average a few months together — of whether the economy is growing, contracting or stagnant. but there are no signs now that the united states is in recession or close to one. and once the economy is close to full employment, gains in jobs take on lesser importance.

Article 4 - payrolls show strong growth but jobless rate rises
“this is very encouraging for the sustainability of the recovery,” said james f. o’sullivan, chief economist at mf global . another brighter sign was among the long-term unemployed. the number of people out of work for more than six months eased to 5.8 million, its lowest level since october 2009. still, 13.7 million people remained without work and were still looking. earlier in the week, a number of reports indicated that the economy had stumbled in the days since the labor department compiled its survey. the biggest worry was a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance , and a survey of companies showed a slowdown in new orders and hiring. bernard baumohl, chief global economist with the economic outlook group, has spent most of the last year as a strong optimist, but sounds increasingly cautious. “there are just too many economic indicators that point to an economy that has been slowing,” said mr. baumohl, noting last week’s report that output slumped to 1.8 percent in the first quarter of the year. “it almost looks like a bull that’s charging through a crowd, utterly impervious to what’s in front of it. “regretfully, i think the pace of hiring will slow down in may and june,” he added. “i think in this case the job market is a lagging indicator, and i think it will probably fall off as well, as more signs point to a weakening economy.”

Article 5 - march hiring data shows a spring thaw
washington — companies stepped up hiring in march for a second month, offering fresh evidence that the american economy was regaining momentum after a weather-driven lull over the winter. private employers added 191,000 workers to payrolls last month and 39,000 more were added in february than had been previously believed, the payroll processor adp said on wednesday. the signs of hiring added to a steady stream of fairly upbeat data suggesting that the economy has started to accelerate as the grip of an unusually severe winter has loosened, inspiring hope that the economy’s performance in 2014 will be its best since the recession ended almost five years ago. “whatever impact the weather was having is starting to dissipate, and we are starting to see the economy gain traction,” said sam bullard, a senior economist at wells fargo securities. advertisement continue reading the main story the figures were made public ahead of the government’s more comprehensive report on employment in march, which is set to be released on friday. that report is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls grew by 200,000, the largest gain in four months, according to a reuters poll of economists.

Article 6 - how to make jobs disappear
photo at precisely 8:30 a.m. on the first friday of the month, thousands of people (including me) stare at a dull government web site and hit refresh until they see the number: how many jobs were created or lost during the previous month. then, with amazing speed, reports and analysis of the number are disseminated by newspapers, bank economists, independent analysts, investment newsletters and countless tv pundits. within minutes, the national narrative is set. either the economy is doing far worse (like last month) or far better (as in january) than anyone realized. the jobs number, which only the most die-hard econonerds (including me) used to care about, is supposed to tell us how the economy is doing. now, though, it is doing something much more complicated. the report on past job performance has morphed into a driver of future job performance, essentially mucking up the thing it’s measuring. and that’s not good, because the initial jobs data are not as precise as many people seem to think. take the most recent report. after it was announced that only about 69,000 jobs were created during may — and that the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 8.2 percent — some observers who had expressed cautious optimism as recently as 8:29 a.m. were instantly transformed into grim cassandras. all at once, it seemed, everyone agreed that president obama’s re-election chances had taken a serious hit and the

Article 8 - earnings in united states are beginning to feel a pinch
after reducing spending and eliminating jobs during the recession, american companies reaped huge gains by keeping expenses down and putting off aggressively hiring new workers as growth slowly returned. strong profits have also propelled the stock market higher, reassuring investors whose other assets, like real estate, have declined in value over the same period. but while the standard & poor’s 500-stock index on friday reached its highest close since 2007 — after the federal reserve’s announcement of its latest stimulus effort — the cycle of steady earnings increases appears to have run its course. “a lot of the profit gain you had in the last few years was a bounce from the recession and a result of very aggressive cost-cutting,” said ethan harris, chief united states economist at bank of america merrill lynch. “those factors are going to be very hard to replicate.” photo the expected decline in profits has yet to set off big layoffs. but it is another factor that is inhibiting hiring and keeping unemployment above the politically important level of 8 percent, executives and economists say. last week, the federal reserve announced its boldest effort yet to kick-start growth and confront persistently high unemployment. the next day, the government reported that industrial production in august fell 1.2 percent, the biggest monthly contraction since march 2009. while executives welcomed the fed’s announcement, many express concern over just how much impact it will have. just over half of managers at north american companies now expect production levels to increase in

end table % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! this article is taken from five gallon ideas, which features over 100 uses for 5 gallon buckets with more being added all the time. we’ve been using these 10 gallon rubbermaid totes as end tables for a while, but it wasn’t worth mentioning on five gallon ideas until recently, when we added an important new detail. the thin plastic lids that ship with these bins make an unstable surface. it’s fine for plopping a purse or keys down on, but you wouldn’t trust it with a mug of hot coffee. which is the one thing we actually use an end table. now don’t go thinking we just stuck some random board on top. this is a very special finished board with a cushion underneath. and this cushion is the exact right shape to fit perfectly into our rubbermaid lid. this means that no amount of jouncing and jittering will buck the surface from the table. although the cushion is angled, the surface of the desk remains level. the desk rests on the lip of the rubbermaid lid rather than on the cushion. the cushion only serves to hold the desk in place and provide some extra grip between the two. the desk top we’re using for our bucket end table is called a “handstand lap desk“ – and that’s usually what we use it for. it’s not so much to

Article 2 - at last, a safe and cost-effective bulk liquid transportation solution
at last, a safe and cost-effective bulk liquid transportation solution (before it's news) transporters face challenging tasks in the bulk movement of liquids. at times you could be hauling hazardous material. based on the road map provided by the consignor, you realize that your crew must pass through residential areas. headache of transporting harmful product when you do not have hazardous material on board, another obstacle might arise. say, a client hires you to carry bulky equipment from the port to a yard in an industrial part of town. wriggling through city traffic could be a headache. tanker contents someone might wonder, what do the trucks you see on the highways carry? good question, but the answers are easy. most of the time, the tanks contain bulk liquids such as: alcoholic beverages oils solvents sulphuric acid hydrogen peroxide food products these go to industries that process food, refine oil or generate power. to ensure that manufacturers get their liquid raw materials on time and safely, bulk transporters use iso tanks. sneak peek into the container’s construction unlike other containers transported by road or rail, an iso tank has a unique design.makers of these tanks use stainless steel. they also put additional layers all round. the number of coatings varies depending on the cargo you intend to carry. the shape of the tank is cylindrical with a utility hole at the top and a valve at the bottom. the hole acts as the opening for loading a product while the valve dispenses it. sizes vary as does

Article 3 - new adventures in water bottle design…squeezable glass?
new adventures in water bottle design…squeezable glass? (before it's news) if you’re an avid backpacker, cyclist, runner, or just plain like carrying a plastic reservoir for your hydration needs around with you, chance are you’ve come into contact with that undesirable (and unavoidable) side effect of weird tastes and smells each sip of the way. regardless if your portable vessel has been plastic or metal, the tradeoff always comes down to what additional flavor you enjoy with your beverages…and last time i checked plastic nor metal is a desirable smell or taste when consuming. needless to say, there’s a reason why coffee is served in ceramic mugs and top-shelf cocktails are served in heavy-based glass tumblers. aiming to solve this glaring material science problem, the new ‘squeezable glass bottle‘ is an interesting move into throwing everything out the window that we know about drinking out of plastic. while the exterior of the bottles is still plastic, the interior is coated with a thin layer (20 nanometers thick to be exact) of silicon-dioxide…aka silica: while the interior isn’t technically glass as we know it, silica naturally wards off the pesky flavors, smells, and bacteria that we’ve come to accept as a natural side effect of wanting to carry liquids around with us. for those worried about the material breaking off over time, there’s no need to fret. silica is used more commonly than you would think in various food items including vitamin supplements and

Article 1 - scarcity, mother of invention
photo ithaca, n.y. in the wake of the closure of a bp oil field in prudhoe bay, alaska, oil prices shot up to $77 a barrel on wednesday, and the chorus of doomsayers concerned about the dire consequences of our fossil fuel dependency has reached a crescendo. if oil hits $100 a barrel, the impact on our economy and lifestyle could be catastrophic, the handwringers warn. but while such a specter seems novel and terrifying, it is in fact familiar and useful. throughout history, shortages of vital resources have driven innovation, and energy has often starred in these technological dramas. the desperate search for new sources of energy and new materials has frequently produced remarkable advances that no one could have imagined when the shortage first became evident. consider the transition from the use of bronze to iron in making tools and weapons, which occurred around the 12th century b.c. early in the second millennium b.c., iron was known as the stuff of meteorites. it was rare and highly prized: if you wanted to give a gift to a pharaoh or a king you didn’t give a gold dagger but an iron one. but when the eastern mediterranean fell short of tin from which to make bronze, a technological revolution occurred. artisans learned to extract metallic iron from iron-rich materials by heating with charcoal (a process called smelting), which caused the price of iron to fall by a factor of 80,000 over 1200

Article 2 - questions to ask before buying a shredder
when it comes to junk mail, some people destroy anything with their name and address on it. but according to the resource center, the most important things to destroy are offers from financial-services companies, like pre-approved credit cards, especially if they have barcodes for automated processing. thieves have been known to sign up for cards using these documents and then submit a new address, so victims don’t discover the problem until their credit ratings are ruined. also be sure to shred any “convenience checks” that arrive with credit card statements, ms. foley said. many people think they’re just marketing claptrap, but they are real checks tied to your account. and shred any other promotional offers someone could use, like invitations to add a card to your account or another phone line. what’s the right cut? experts recommend using, at minimum, a cross-cut shredder, which cuts a standard-size piece of paper into about 400 little rectangles. as mark mettler, senior vice president for merchandising at staples, put it, “picture a rolling pin full of teeth, and the teeth are meshing as the paper rolls through.” even with cross-cut, however, it’s possible that some numbers and words may remain visible, especially if the print is small. so people like lawyers or mental health professionals with home offices, who need to destroy highly sensitive information, may want to consider a micro-cut shredder, which cuts a standard page into about 3,000 pieces.

Article 3 - why trump won
(getty images) i live and work in the silicon valley/new york tech media bubble, as do most of my friends and many of my relatives. they're stunned tonight. there's talk of vomiting, of grabbing their passports. i just got back from four days in the deep red trump country of eastern tennessee to attend a wedding, and i've been visiting every year or two (or three) since i met my wife in 1996. i didn't grow up there, but i enjoy my visits there. our relatives there treat me well. i love them like you love relatives who you know you'll never talk politics with. and i think i sort of understand where they're coming from, even if i disagree. here are some observations that may help my friends who never left the bicoastal bubble — and all of you around the world who are looking on in shock — understand how americans just elected somebody who 61% of americans in a recent poll said was not qualified to be president. one relative worked in a photo processing lab for more than 20 years and used that job to singlehandedly support her family. she was laid off a few years away from retirement. the company was cutting costs thanks to competition from digital imaging technology that made film obsolete, and hers was one of the jobs to be cut. she got nothing extra. no pension, no retirement. we tell people like her that they're supposed to retrain, get educated, get

Article 4 - payrolls show strong growth but jobless rate rises
“this is very encouraging for the sustainability of the recovery,” said james f. o’sullivan, chief economist at mf global . another brighter sign was among the long-term unemployed. the number of people out of work for more than six months eased to 5.8 million, its lowest level since october 2009. still, 13.7 million people remained without work and were still looking. earlier in the week, a number of reports indicated that the economy had stumbled in the days since the labor department compiled its survey. the biggest worry was a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance , and a survey of companies showed a slowdown in new orders and hiring. bernard baumohl, chief global economist with the economic outlook group, has spent most of the last year as a strong optimist, but sounds increasingly cautious. “there are just too many economic indicators that point to an economy that has been slowing,” said mr. baumohl, noting last week’s report that output slumped to 1.8 percent in the first quarter of the year. “it almost looks like a bull that’s charging through a crowd, utterly impervious to what’s in front of it. “regretfully, i think the pace of hiring will slow down in may and june,” he added. “i think in this case the job market is a lagging indicator, and i think it will probably fall off as well, as more signs point to a weakening economy.”

Article 5 - from pie-in-the-sky dream to hottest truck in town
twenty months earlier, when mr. darsky decided to take his pizza to the streets in a food truck, he had no inkling that the seemingly modest plan would swell to such tremendous proportions. “it seemed like a good way to save money,” he remarked dryly, adding: “this has not proved to be the case. this thing blew up.” the same could be said for his culinary career, which began, seemingly on impulse, in 2008. “i needed a job,” he said over drinks last fall in the mission district here. “i had just failed the california bar exam because i didn’t really study. i decided at the end of law school that i didn’t want to be a lawyer. i’d always liked pizza and had heard about pizzaiolo,” a neapolitan-style pizzeria in nearby oakland. he continued: “on a whim, my wife and i went to yom kippur services in oakland, and afterwards, like good jews, we went for pizza. i said, ‘hey, do you need someone to make dough?’ ” mr. darsky spent seven months at pizzaiolo, developing a fascination with dough-making. in his free time, he said, “i read every book on the subject.” especially influential was a section of harold mcgee’s tome “on food and cooking” that explains gluten formation. from oakland, he migrated to pizzeria delfina

Article 6 - nobody said snap-together meant it was a snap
the salt water fuel cell monster truck ($26, owirobots.com) is a labor-intensive snap-together model truck with an innovative diy battery - a tiny fuel cell, the same technology that some automakers like honda hope will provide the green future of personal transportation. inside the box you'll find a tiny electric motor, stamp-sized sheets of magnesium for power and about a hundred snap-together parts. because each part is molded at once, it must be carefully trimmed, a tedious job that requires some extra tools (we used nail clippers). also not in the box: some salt, water, a screwdriver and, for me, reading glasses in order to help me working my way through the 26 pages of instructions. building the truck consumed an entire evening of debugging by our 16-year-old exchange student, after a frustrating bout with a jammed piston, which also used half of our battery materials (refills cost $7). but we had fun, and learned that five drops of salt water, when carefully dripped onto the magnesium, can make enough power to make the truck grind across the floor for about 15 minutes. we also figured out that a single aa battery works, too, with a little duct tape. this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. photo

Article 7 - democrats pressure trump to fulfill promise to impose steel tariffs
when the administration announced the investigation, “we felt, o.k., they’ve got the message. but they’ve just dragged their feet and delayed and delayed,” mr. schumer said. “the bottom line is the president has been a total paper tiger on this issue, and as a result, we feel the need to hold up nominees for the commerce department.” the delays in imposing the tariffs appear to have further worsened conditions for the american steel industry, which was already struggling financially with a global glut of cheap metal. to get ahead of the tariffs, foreign manufacturers appear to have shipped more steel and aluminum into the country. steel imports rose 20 percent in the five months since the investigation was announced in april, compared with the previous five months, the american iron and steel institute said on thursday. the import surges have helped fuel more layoffs and plant closings, according to scott paul, the president of the alliance for american manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers. according to mr. paul, that includes layoffs of 180 workers at the dura-bond industries plant in steelton, pa., and 150 workers at arcelormittal’s rolling mill in conshohocken, pa. the president signed executive orders in april calling for the department of commerce to open two separate investigations into whether imports of steel and aluminum were harming american national security. initiated under the rarely used section 232 of a 1962 trade law, the investigations gave the president broad authority

Article 8 - companies spending money to save money
a sharp cutback in capital spending, starting in the fall of 2000, brought on the recent recession. now that this spending is no longer falling, the drag on the economy is fading. but that apparent improvement is still not enough to support a vigorous lasting expansion. ''capital spending has basically hit bottom,'' said mark zandi, chief economist at economy.com. ''but i don't see any significant rebound -- not yet.'' the improvement in capital spending is spotty, and idiosyncratic. truckers, for example, are purchasing new tractor-trailers in greater numbers. they are doing so partly because of a slight increase in freight deliveries, thanks to the inventory replenishment and partly in anticipation of a new environmental regulation, effective oct. 1, governing engine emission. what will happen once inventories are replenished and oct. 1 passes is anyone's guess, says robert costello, chief economist at the american trucking association. that helps to explain why truck manufacturers have not stepped up their spending on new machinery, or hired more workers. instead, they are relying on overtime to handle what might turn out to be a temporary rise in orders. contributing to the increase in orders are truckers like john mantlo of fort worth who are beginning to replace the aging tractors that haul their trailers with new ones. ''we had 600,000 miles on a tractor we purchased in 2000,'' mr. mantlo said, explaining his recent purchase of a

Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Oil prices surged to $77 a barrel after BP's Prudhoe Bay oil field closure in Alaska. Experts warn that if prices hit $100 a barrel, it could be catastrophic for the economy and lifestyle.

In contrast, a cross-cut shredder can cut paper into 400 little rectangles, while a micro-cut shredder cuts paper into 3,000 pieces. Thieves target financial offers with barcodes, so shredding them is crucial to protect credit ratings.

Donald Trump won the presidential election despite being unqualified, according to 61% of Americans in a recent poll. His supporters come from diverse backgrounds, including those who lost their jobs due to digital imaging technology.

Payrolls show strong growth, but the jobless rate rose to 13.7 million people still looking for work. The economy is slowing down, with output slumping to 1.8% in the first quarter of the year.

A food truck entrepreneur built a successful business by following his passion for pizza-making. He spent seven months learning about dough-making and developed an innovative DIY battery.

The administration's delay in imposing steel tariffs has worsened conditions for the American steel industry, leading to layoffs and plant closures. Companies are spending money to save money, with truckers purchasing new tractors and relying on overtime to handle temporary rises in orders.

Overall, these articles highlight the complexities of the economy, the importance of protecting personal data, and the power

Article 1 - for father working three jobs, a startling diagnosis
the morning of march 31, 2009, is stamped on jose perez’s brain. he woke up with stabbing pains in his legs. his wife called an ambulance, and he was taken to staten island university hospital. a nurse ran a blood test. half an hour later, five doctors walked into his room. “they told me i had renal failure,” mr. perez, 40, a father of four, recalled recently. “when i told them i needed to get back to work, they said, basically, ‘you can go back to work and die, or you can start coming in for dialysis treatments.’ ” mr. perez laughed and said, “i decided to come in for dialysis.” the timing was terrible. two years before, mr. perez and his wife, mary luz marin, 43, had bought their first house, on a quiet street in the new brighton section of staten island. the couple’s first son, jose perez iv, was eight months old, and the house seemed to be the perfect place to raise a family. but a week after the family moved in, a severe storm backed up a sewer line, flooding the basement with sewage and causing over $40,000 worth of damage. the family’s insurance did not cover the cost because the house was not in a flood zone. soon after, mr. perez, an experienced plumber and handyman, discovered that the house’s foundation was slowly

the new old age paula span posted at nytimes.com/newoldage. it's right in my neighborhood, so i've probably driven past that gracious victorian house, painted a dusty rose, a zillion times. but because it looks like many other houses in montclair, n.j., i never realized that it was an assisted living facility. of the one million people in assisted living, about one-third live in residences with fewer than 16 residents, said karl polzer, senior policy director of the national council on assisted living. several of the nine current residents at the victorian house, called horizon manor south, were just finishing lunch in the sunny dining room when i came by for a visit. three women chatted over their canned peaches; two others ate in silence. because few of these small homes can afford to do much marketing, and because they blend into neighborhoods, they are often overlooked. but small-scale assisted living remains a reasonable option for people who need help with daily activities, particularly those with dementia. they often cost less, and you can't beat the staffing ratio. in this house, for example, three staff members are caring for nine residents each day, with two staff members each on the evening and overnight shifts. i could see some disadvantages, too. there isn't a lot of organized activity, and most of the current residents have some degree of dementia; an alert older person who wants to play scrabble or take field trips to the museum would

Article 3 - the gift apartment from mom and dad
these purchases raise a number of financial and estate planning questions, and lawyers and building managers advise parents to structure the arrangement carefully. “there are tax implications to think about, building rules to consider, and the question of access — as in do the parents have a right to stay there or drop in whenever they want?” said roberta axelrod, the director of residential sales and rentals at time equities, a real estate developer and management company. there are also more mundane issues to be hammered out, like who pays the maintenance, who pays for any work that needs to be done, and who gets any profits when the apartment is sold. ms. axelrod said she had seen families signing formal agreements and families making verbal agreements. “but more often than not,” she said, “people don’t talk about the future, and that leads to tension when they find out that everybody has a different idea about it. it’s important that the different parties all understand and agree in advance.” steve wagner, a real estate lawyer, said that because family circumstances vary and buildings have different practices, “each situation dictates what will make sense.” he advised putting agreements in writing, but added that “legal documents have to be drafted, because there are no standard forms that deal with this stuff.” photo in one of the simplest scenarios, the parents buy and keep an apartment in their name and agree to pay the monthly carrying costs, and the child lives there as a family member, not a rent

''when we changed something, we always thought, 'what would mrs. strauss have thought?' '' steve herman said. next door to us when we moved in were the tollins, three generations of them. there was the one son, mark, and mrs. tollin's parents from england, daisy and fred moss. they provided whatever celebrity there was on south bowling green in those days, since mrs. tollin's cousin was sterling moss, an international race-car driving star in midcentury. now scott and ellen friedman live there, and they are woodcrest legacies. she grew up on lilac lane near barby lane, named for harold sarshik's daughter barbara. scott lived on russet, which was ''the woods'' before houses went up there in the 1970's. ''ellen always liked it here, so when we eventually got married, we decided to look for a house in woodcrest,'' scott friedman said. ''but when we moved in, this house was a god-awful mess. there were candles all over the place, i guess, so we wouldn't see what was bad. but it had this big picture window and ellen was pregnant, so we said we would clean it up and make it ours.'' south bowling green drive was in what original residents called ''the first tract'' of woodcrest. eventually, the sarshiks built four tracts

Article 6 - home front; staying in a shelter, and in the workplace
she was sent back to the family homeless intake office in the bronx, where for nearly a month she was bounced through different overnight placements. exhaustion and frustration caused her to miss at least a week of work, she said. rebecca was able to save her job, however, because of two lucky breaks. for starters, she had a long track record as a reliable worker, and her supervisor was sympathetic, letting her spend time away from the job to tackle housing problems. second, and perhaps more important, she had a friend who went to extraordinary lengths to help out. ''during the week i was out,'' she recalled, ''my friend covered by doing double shift from 8 in the morning to 8 at night.'' in the end it was the thought of this colleague, who was missing time with her own children, that motivated rebecca to get back to work no matter what. ''i'd say i am going to be 15 minutes late or an hour late or whatever,'' rebecca said, ''but i'd tell her i am coming.'' recently, she learned that she will get a federal housing subsidy, and she is planning to leave the shelter this month. for others, the city's shelter system has been a much more nurturing place for work. jerome griffin, 46, for example, has worked the last seven months as a security guard at a center for the elderly. a former crack cocaine addict, he arrived in new york in late 2002 job

Article 7 - which way is home?
in some respects, sept. 11 was just the beginning. subsequent shock waves included the anthrax scare along with threats to the subway system, the brooklyn bridge, the statue of liberty and times square. although relatively few families eventually left -- no reliable figures exist as to exactly how many -- the decision-making process forced people to reassess their relationship with the city. as tenants of 600 gateway plaza, one of only two residential buildings physically damaged in the attack (the other was 114 liberty street), the galloways and fortinskys confronted these questions early on and under harrowing circumstances. their building became an f.b.i. crime scene, their neighborhood an international epicenter of mourning. they became refugees, separated from the small, ridiculously meaningful things -- a thomas the tank engine table, a beloved dog's ashes -- that make a few rooms a place of significance. though a year later, one family remains in new york and the other has left, both the galloways and the fortinskys struggled hard to find their way home. unbreakable tie like generations of new yorkers before them, the galloways were drawn to the city like dorothy to oz. jeff galloway had arrived in 1978 from california to attend columbia law school, which he had chosen specifically so he could live the exciting life of a new yorker. four years later, he became one of the first residents of the newly opened gateway plaza, a cluster of

""there were three on every block."" she had been living on 13th street, in a 1910 tenement renovated by the federal department of housing and urban development and then, as so many buildings were in the 1970's, abandoned by its landlord. drawn to the unpainted canvas of the area, ms. dedominicis was one of a group of squatters and community gardeners who brought the building -- and the neighborhood -- back into the 20th century.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles discuss various aspects of life, including financial struggles, family dynamics, and the challenges of living in New York City. 

A father, Jose Perez, was diagnosed with renal failure after working three jobs to support his family. He chose dialysis treatment over death. The family had recently moved into a house that suffered from foundation damage due to a sewer line backup.

In contrast, small-scale assisted living facilities like Horizon Manor South in Montclair, NJ, offer affordable options for people with dementia. These homes often have low staffing ratios and can be overlooked due to their small size.

The concept of gifting apartments to family members raises financial and estate planning questions. Parents must structure arrangements carefully, considering tax implications, building rules, and access rights.

The article ""Lives; We Are (Still) Family"" shares a personal story about a couple's struggles with marriage and homelessness. The wife, Alberta, had strokes in 1995, and the husband left home for several trial periods before returning.

Article 6 discusses the challenges of finding housing and staying employed while homeless. Rebecca was able to save her job due to two lucky breaks: her long track record as a reliable worker and a supportive friend who covered her shifts.

The article ""Which Way is Home?"" explores how the 9/11 attacks affected families in New York City. The Galloways and Fortinskys, tenants of damaged buildings, struggled to find their way home amidst international mourning and chaos.

Guantanamo force-feeding constitutes torture, as 130 detainees refuse food and are subjected to painful procedures, including tubes being forced through their noses and throats. The Obama administration dismissed this issue, showing disdain for the pain and suffering.

In a separate development, former US President George W. Bush was found guilty of war crimes by an international tribunal in Malaysia. Seven key members of his administration were also convicted for torture and cruel treatment.

Additionally, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher criticized the harsh treatment of two convicted border patrol agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, who are being held in solitary confinement under conditions more severe than those experienced by terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.

The US human rights record has been widely criticized, with a UN report denouncing the country's ongoing genocidal crimes, torture, and abuse of power. The report also highlighted the lack of rule of law principles in Washington.

Two bills before Congress threaten to transfer investigative oversight in terrorism cases from the Justice Department to other agencies, potentially undermining Attorney General Eric Holder's authority.

Paul D. Clement, Deputy Solicitor General, argued that detainees were held to gather intelligence and facilitate questioning, but this was limited by their lack of access to family members and lawyers (Article 2).

The CIA's use of torture and interrogation techniques has been questioned, with former counterterrorism director Jose Rodriguez discussing the ""stress position"" technique in a video (Article 6). 

Prosecutor Michelle Bensouda reported that there was a ""reasonable basis"" for investigating war crimes committed by US military forces in Afghanistan and secret detention facilities operated by the CIA (Article 7).

Article 5 - “bills would transfer oversight of terror cases”
“bills would transfer oversight of terror cases” by kevin johnson “as nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. in both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. and it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air – however slight – lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.” - justice william o. douglas washington — “in the justice department’s ornate great hall, a space traditionally reserved for its most important functions, attorney general eric holder stepped before staffers last week to mark the department’s accomplishments in the first two years of the obama administration and the challenges to be confronted in the term’s second half. attorney general eric holder says the u.s. will continue to rely on the federal court system to bring terror suspects to justice. perhaps most striking about the speech — which reaffirmed the department’s commitment to national security — were words that holder did not utter: guantanamo bay. just weeks after the administration capitulated on its promise to shut down the prison at guantanamo and referred the suspects there to trials by military commissions — not civilian courts — holder’s address was partly an attempt to turn the page on a painful political loss. even so, the guantanamo decision may mark just the first fight in a continuing battle to undermine his authority in terrorism prosecutions. at least two bills before congress threaten to transfer much of the investigative oversight in terrorism cases, which are currently holder’s responsibility

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! daphne eviatar | huffingtonpost.com it didn’t take long for the word “torture” to rear its ugly head in the september 11th terrorism case, as pre-trial hearings began today with a slew of procedural issues. though the question of whether the five accused men have to actually show up in court every day wouldn’t seem all that exciting or controversial, as soon as one of the defense lawyers started to say his client was traumatized by having been tortured at the hands of his u.s. interrogators, the judge shut him up. “we have to talk about torture,” said defense attorney captain michael schwartz, who represents walid bin attash, claiming it’s relevant to whether the accused should be “forcibly extracted” from their prison cells. “no we don’t. i’m telling you i don’t think it’s relevant to this issue,” said judge james l. pohl, presiding over the military commission case of the five 9/11 co-defendants. “i’m not going to keep revisiting the issue i told you is not relevant.” read more: judge bans the t-word in 9-11 hearing

(click here to view full image.) december 7, 2013 dr. bruce jessen’s handwritten notes describe some of the torture techniques that were used to “exploit” “war on terror” detainees in custody of the cia and department of defense. bush administration officials have long asserted that the torture techniques used on “war on terror” detainees were utilized as a last resort in an effort to gain actionable intelligence to thwart pending terrorist attacks against the united states and its interests abroad. but the handwritten notes obtained exclusively by truthout drafted two decades ago by dr. john bruce jessen, the psychologist who was under contract to the cia and credited as being one of the architects of the government’s top-secret torture program, tell a dramatically different story about the reasons detainees were brutalized and it was not just about obtaining intelligence. jason leopold interviews jessen’s former sere colleague, retired air force capt. michael kearns. rather, as jessen’s notes explain, torture was used to “exploit” detainees, that is, to break them down physically and mentally, in order to get them to “collaborate” with government authorities. jessen’s notes emphasize how a “detainer” uses the stresses of detention to produce the appearance of compliance in

Article 1 - a ruling on the rights of the detained
to the editor: re “justices, 5-4, back detainee appeals for guantánamo” (front page, june 13): the supreme court’s decision marked the third time the court has rebuked this administration’s lawless actions at guantánamo. it shows that the judiciary will not lie down while this or any administration further harms the health and sanity of the men who have been held there in harsh conditions with no due process for the last six and a half years. the decision will go a long way to eliminating any future temptation to engage in lawless abuses because no court is watching. the executive may no longer falsely claim credit for detaining and incapacitating terrorists when in many documented cases they have just swept up innocent men and hidden them from scrutiny. we have been working tirelessly representing the detainees since the day they arrived, and the supreme court has answered our call for justice. now it’s imperative that the lower courts move with full speed in adjudicating the prisoners’ cases so they do not spend one more day than necessary without a fair hearing. vincent warren executive director center for constitutional rights new york, june 13, 2008  to the editor: agreed: we must protect our nation. but how tragic if we throw away 200 years of constitutional wisdom, based on arguments of immediate efficacy. advertisement continue reading the main story we face a fundamental decision in our day: do we choose to trust the constitution,

Article 2 - guantánamo prisoners seek to see families and lawyers
paul d. clement, the deputy solicitor general who argued for the justice department, said the detainees were being held not only to take them off the battlefield but also as a resource of information about al qaeda. mr. clement said that they were held at guantánamo ''to facilitate intelligence gathering'' and that the authorities wanted the detainees available to answer questions that might arise as new information came in. he suggested that the value of such questioning would be limited if the detainees were able to have open communications with family members and lawyers. ''one of the fundamental aspects of holding someone as an enemy combatant is that you can hold them without access to counsel, without access to their family,'' mr. clement said. ''the authority to hold them at all is the authority to hold them under those conditions.'' the main issue in the case revolves around the unusual legal status of the guantánamo base. officials chose the base, in southeast cuba, because it was isolated from civilians and remote enough to allow the government to control the detainees. the authorities also said they thought the base would be out of reach of american courts. in july, judge colleen kollar-kotelly of the federal district court for the district of columbia confirmed that strategy when she ruled that the base was not formally part of the united states and that as a result the detainees did not have constitutional protections. under well-established principles, even noncitizens have some constitutional protections once they are

Article 3 - bush advisers weigh closing guantánamo prison sooner
dana perino, a white house spokeswoman, said today there is no deadline for closing down the facility. “everybody is working towards the goal to meet what the president has asked them to do, which is to do it as soon as possible,” she said. the abrupt cancellation of the meeting prompted a statement on thursday evening by gordon johndroe, a spokesman for the national security council, that was true but did not reflect the state of the debate about the detention camp. “the president has long expressed a desire to close the guantanamo bay detention facility and to do so in a responsible way,” mr. johndroe said. “a number of steps need to take place before that can happen such as setting up military commissions and the repatriation to their home countries of detainees who have been cleared for release. these and other steps have not been completed. no decisions on the future of guantanamo bay are imminent and there will not be a white house meeting tomorrow.” guantanamo was chosen for the detention camp in the first place because, while it is an american military installation, it is not on american soil, and thus not as unambiguously subject to american law as are prisons within the united states. transferring the prisoners from guantanamo would raise a host of legal, diplomatic and human rights questions, depending on whether they were sent to their home countries, other countries, or to military prisons in the united states. but the continued confinement of the detainees, some

or, as mr. hogan said on thursday, “inmates were literally running this prison.” “making matters even worse, a number of employees either stood by, or in many cases enabled these criminals and the vast corruption that quickly followed,” he said. “maryland taxpayers were unwittingly underwriting a vast criminal enterprise run by gang members and corrupt public servants.” it is a characterization that the f.b.i. and prosecutors publicly made in 2013, saying the jail was being run by members of the black guerrilla family, the gang that mr. white commanded. gang members had cemented control not just from payoffs or profit-sharing, but also by having sex with many of the female guards, manipulating the very people who were supposed to be watching over them. photo corrupt corrections officers, an f.b.i. affidavit said, “give their allegiance and loyalty to these inmates in an effort to make money and/or further their sexual relationships.” by one inmate’s estimate cited in the affidavit, about two-thirds of the guards smuggled contraband or were having sex with inmates. gang documents recovered by officials at a maryland prison even described how black guerrilla family recruits were instructed to “target a specific stereotype” of corrections officer who could be easily manipulated: “women with low self-esteem, insecurities and certain physical attributes.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must

Article 5 - the questions brennan can’t dodge
i was struck to find my name on page 4 of the white paper, which summarized my argument that “the conflict between the united states and al qaeda cannot lawfully extend to nations outside afghanistan in which the level of hostilities is less intense or prolonged than in afghanistan itself.” the lawyers dismissed my view, arguing that “there is little judicial or other authoritative precedent” on the issue, since the nation is fighting a “transnational, non-state actor” where the “principal theater of operations” is not in a country in conflict with america. these are more than legal quibbles. when hellfire missiles were first used in drone strikes to kill outside a combat zone — in yemen, in 2002 — six men died, including an american. a united nations special rapporteur declared the action unlawful, but c.i.a. drone attacks have increased substantially since then: the bureau of investigative journalism, a nonprofit news organization in london, estimates the number of persons killed in drone attacks at 3,000 to 4,500, including well over 200 children. today, the united states is involved in a true armed conflict only in afghanistan. yet drone attacks have been carried out in yemen, somalia and pakistan and may soon begin in libya, mali and nigeria. none of these countries have attacked america, so no right of self-defense can be invoked under the united nations charter, as the white paper asserts. newsletter sign up

Article 7 - u.s. forces may have committed war crimes in afghanistan, prosecutor says
ms. bensouda, in an annual report published monday, said there was a “reasonable basis” for her to open investigations into “war crimes of torture and related ill-treatment, by u.s. military forces deployed to afghanistan and in secret detention facilities operated by the central intelligence agency.” the focus, she said, would be mostly on any crimes that occurred in 2003 and 2004. david bosco, an indiana university professor who follows the court, said the language of the report suggested that ms. bensouda was ready to seek its permission to proceed to an investigation in “a matter of days or weeks.” mr. bosco said he was also struck by references in the report that signaled an interest to broaden her inquiry into prisoner abuse in secret detention facilities in other countries that belong to the court, including poland and romania. the report also said she had found evidence of “torture and related ill treatment by afghan government forces,” particularly by its intelligence agency and the police. war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the taliban and its affiliated networks would also be a target of investigation, the report said. photo the investigation could also set up a potential showdown with president-elect donald j. trump, who has said he supports torture as a tool of counterterrorism. the rules of the court set a very high bar for the prosecutor to begin a full investigation. that can often take years to meet, frustrating the court’s

what followed was a scuffle that left at least some of the military lawyers embittered and stoked old tensions at the pentagon between civilian leaders and uniformed military officers, who under defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld have often found themselves privately at odds. early thursday morning, white house allies distributed the letter that the lawyers had signed, as evidence that the group, known as jags, now supported the administration plan. that prompted loud protests from republican senators opposed to the plan. they dismissed the letter on grounds that the lawyers would have signed it only under pressure. the truth lies somewhere in between, said one of the senior lawyers and other current and former military officials familiar with their views. “i didn’t have any problem signing what i signed,’’ maj. gen. charles j. dunlap jr., deputy judge advocate general of the air force, said friday in an interview. “how people use it and what they use it for i can’t control.’’ general dunlap represented the air force at the meeting because the top lawyer was out of town. a spokesman for the pentagon, bryan whitman, said it was nonsense to suggest that the military lawyers had been coerced, a point that general dunlap agreed with. “do you really think that an officer with 30 years’ service could be coerced by the pentagon bureaucracy to sign something he didn’t want to sign?” general dunlap asked. advertisement continue reading the main story of the

Title: guant&aacute;namo rulings change little
Content: over the last two weeks, three federal judges have issued rulings on the legitimacy of the recent rough treatment being doled out to the detainees at guantánamo bay , cuba . under normal circumstances, two of the rulings would add up to a resounding victory for the detainees. but at guantánamo bay, where prisoners the government itself acknowledges are not security threats can see no end to their decade-plus imprisonment, nothing is “normal.” the rulings began on july 8, when judge gladys kessler opined that the force-feeding of detainees who have been on a hunger strike was “painful, humiliating and degrading” — which is to say, precisely, what the detainees and their lawyers have been claiming for months. she scoffed at the government’s contention that the detainees were receiving “timely, compassionate, quality health care.” three days later, royce c. lamberth , the chief judge for the federal district court in the district of columbia , ruled that prison guards had to stop touching the genitals of the detainees as part of new, tougher search protocols. since early this year, meetings and even phone calls between detainees and their lawyers have had to take place outside the prisoner’s own “camp.” this meant they had to be searched in this offensive manner both on the trip out to see their lawyers and on the trip back. because many detainees had religious objections to the genital searches, they were refusing to speak to their lawyers. (the third ruling, on july 16, by judge rosemary collyer of federal district court, disagreed with kessler. collyer wrote that force-feeding was humane and that the detainees “had no right to commit suicide.”) advertisement continue reading the main story did anything change as a result of the opinions by kessler and lamberth? no. despite her clear dismay at the treatment of the detainees, kessler concluded that she lacked the ability to do anything about it because, she said, the judiciary doesn’t have the authority to intervene over the conditions under which the detainees are being jailed. photo

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various human rights issues related to the US government's actions, particularly in the context of the War on Terror. 

Guantanamo force-feeding constitutes torture, as 130 detainees refuse food and are subjected to painful procedures, including tubes being forced through their noses and throats. The Obama administration dismissed this issue, showing disdain for the pain and suffering.

In a separate development, former US President George W. Bush was found guilty of war crimes by an international tribunal in Malaysia. Seven key members of his administration were also convicted for torture and cruel treatment.

Additionally, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher criticized the harsh treatment of two convicted border patrol agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, who are being held in solitary confinement under conditions more severe than those experienced by terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.

The US human rights record has been widely criticized, with a UN report denouncing the country's ongoing genocidal crimes, torture, and abuse of power. The report also highlighted the lack of rule of law principles in Washington.

Two bills before Congress threaten to transfer investigative oversight in terrorism cases from the Justice Department to other agencies, potentially undermining Attorney General Eric Holder's authority.

Finally, a judge banned the use of the word ""torture"" during a 9/11 terrorism case, citing its irrelevance to the issue at hand.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles discuss various topics related to the US government's actions, particularly regarding the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. 

A Supreme Court ruling (Article 1) marked the third time the court has rebuked the administration's lawless actions at Guantanamo Bay, emphasizing the importance of due process for detained men.

Paul D. Clement, Deputy Solicitor General, argued that detainees were held to gather intelligence and facilitate questioning, but this was limited by their lack of access to family members and lawyers (Article 2).

The White House has stated there is no deadline for closing Guantanamo Bay, with Dana Perino saying the President wants it closed in a responsible manner (Article 3). However, transferring prisoners raises numerous legal, diplomatic, and human rights questions.

Maryland's Governor ordered the immediate shuttering of Baltimore Jail due to corruption and gang control (Article 4).

The CIA's use of torture and interrogation techniques has been questioned, with former counterterrorism director Jose Rodriguez discussing the ""stress position"" technique in a video (Article 6). 

Prosecutor Michelle Bensouda reported that there was a ""reasonable basis"" for investigating war crimes committed by US military forces in Afghanistan and secret detention facilities operated by the CIA (Article 7).

Military lawyers were caught in the middle on tribunals, with some signing a letter supporting the administration's plan but others expressing concerns about coercion (Article 8).

A Workers Inquiry into the Bankruptcy of Detroit is being held to uncover the social and historical roots of the city's financial crisis and expose the political interests behind it. The plan for adjustment, worked out with creditors, aims to gut pensions and health benefits for over 20,000 retired workers and privatize public assets.

Gun control advocates are pushing for the government to reward firearms manufacturers that acquiesce to ""voluntary"" gun control measures, while punishing those that refuse. Metro-IAF wants to inject gun control politics into federal firearms acquisition procedures.

Walter Williams explains how liberalism's focus on targeted groups ultimately harms society, using Detroit as an example of how a city's decline can be attributed to political favoritism and tax policies against higher-income residents.

The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) has been organizing against police crimes for decades. After the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the alliance sees a spark for community control of the police.

The Chicago City Council has passed a fake police accountability bill, replacing the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) with a civilian office of police accountability (COPA). The mayor's proposal was met with criticism from community leaders.

President Obama is trying to turn another tragedy into a political opportunity, using the murder of 15-year-old Zaevion Dobson in Knoxville, Tennessee, to push for gun control measures.","Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is leaving office and will serve time in jail. He acknowledged his ""poor judgment"" and asked for support from the city.

In Ferguson, Missouri, a federal plan to overhaul police and courts has been approved. The reforms include changing policies on stun guns and shooting at moving vehicles, repealing questionable laws, and hiring an independent monitor.

New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani cited the criminal past of a man who was shot by police as evidence that he had authorized the disclosure of his record. However, some critics condemned Giuliani's comments.

In Irvington, New Jersey, a store owner was shot dead just hours after being robbed. The authorities have no suspects and are investigating the circumstances.

Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan District Attorney, has implemented an ""intelligence-driven prosecution"" approach to crime using data analysis. This approach has been emulated in other jurisdictions.

Philadelphia defended its policy on frisking, with limits, citing a need to balance public safety with civil liberties. The city's homicide rate remains high despite increased use of stop-and-frisk tactics.

In New York City, the monitoring program behind ""broken windows"" policing has ramped up as violent crime reaches historic lows. The debate over policing has shifted towards quality-of-life crimes.

Article 2 - the workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit
the workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit (before it's news) on saturday, the socialist equality party in the us is holding a workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit and the attack on the dia & pensions. the aim of the inquiry is to uncover the social and historical roots of the bankruptcy of detroit and expose the political and financial interests behind this attack on the working class. the purpose of the meeting is to provide workers and young people with the knowledge they need to fight back. the inquiry is being held as emergency manager kevyn orr, detroit’s financial dictator, prepares to release his “plan of adjustment.” worked out in collaboration with the city’s biggest creditors, the plan will call for the gutting of the pensions and health benefits of more than 20,000 retired city workers and the privatization of public assets, including the cultural treasures of the detroit institute of arts (dia). what is taking place in detroit is a social crime of immense proportions. an entire city is being plundered in order to further enrich the financial elite. what happens in detroit will, moreover, be used as a precedent for the rest of the united states and for working class populations around the world. the inquiry will seek to establish that the bankruptcy is the product not simply of abstract economic forces, but of a political conspiracy being carried out in behalf of definite class interests, involving michigan’s republican governor, state and local democrats, powerful financial and legal firms

Article 3 - gun control group would endanger military by politicizing firearm procurement process
as if misguided anti-gun policies that leave our fighting men and women defenseless stateside weren’t enough, some gun control advocates are intent on reviving a clinton-era gun control tactic that would pose a danger to our military in the field. in an opinion piece for the saturday edition of the new york times, several representatives of the metro industrial areas foundation, described as a group “aimed at building power for social change,” encouraged president obama to inject gun control politics into federal firearms acquisition procedure. more specifically, metro-iaf wants the president to exercise the federal government’s purchasing power to reward firearms manufacturers that acquiesce to “voluntary” gun control measures in its dealings with civilian gun owners, and punish those that refuse to curb the rights of american gun owners. according to the group, “for the government to keep buying guns from these companies — purchases meant to ensure public safety — without making demands for change is to squander its leverage.” the first organization metro-iaf would like to foist their gun control experiment on is the u.s. army. the group states, “the pentagon is in the process of selecting the provider of handguns for the united states army. it should require all bidders to provide detailed information about their gun safety technologies and distribution practices in the civilian market. no response, no contract.” another target specifically mentioned by metro-iaf is the fbi. however, it appears the group would like to extend this strategy to all of

Article 4 - where liberalism “succeeds,” explained by walter williams
(before it's news) the liberal political pathology that focuses on targeted groups is ultimately harmful to society. but no part of society is harmed more than the group liberalism pretends to be helping. its “favored” status turns into that of sacrificial lamb to be slaughtered on the altar of liberalism. walter williams uses the city of detroit to explain how this works: joann watson, detroit city council member, said, “our people in an overwhelming way supported the re-election of this president, and there ought to be a quid pro quo.” in other words, president obama should send the nearly bankrupted city of detroit millions in taxpayer bailout money. but there’s a painful lesson to be learned from decades of political hustling and counsel by intellectuals and urban experts. in 1960, detroit’s population was 1.6 million. blacks were 29 percent, and whites were 70 percent. today, detroit’s population has fallen precipitously to 707,000, of which blacks are 84 percent and whites 8 percent. much of the city’s decline began with the election of coleman young, detroit’s first black mayor and mayor for five terms, who engaged in political favoritism to blacks and tax policies against higher income mostly white people. young’s successors, dennis archer and kwame kilpatrick, followed his third world tyrant policies, but neither had his verbal vulgarity. kilpatrick (

black lives matter’s deray unironically calls mayor who led new york through 9/11 a “disgrace” (before it's news) if there’s anyone on the planet who we should be listening to less, it’s black lives matter’s lead mascot, deray mckesson. to catch you up on the kind of person that mckesson is, he’s sees racial bias in everything, thinks police are bad, looting is good, and will block you if you try to argue with him…or even if you don’t. so far he’s up to 19,000 people! this is the same guy who thinks cops should be independently investigated by sources outside of police departments, and i’m sure what he has in mind will be super fair. recently, his jimmies were rustled when former new york mayor, rudy giuliani, called black lives matter an “inherently racist” movement. many may agree with giuliani, as blm’s most vocal member have been consistently anti-white. giuliani, however, explains that a movement only concerned with one kind of skin color is itself a racist movement. deray couldn’t take that lying down, and went on msnbc to say something that only a dunce would say. “it is better for the american people and certainly the people of new york city that giuliani is no longer a public official. his statements remind us that he is both the

Article 7 - chicago city council passes fake police accountability bill
chicago city council passes fake police accountability bill (before it's news) fight back news service is circulating the following oct. 6 statement from the chicago alliance against racist & political repression (caarpr). shame on city hall as copa passes – movement for cpac grows as justice is denied the chicago city council has voted to pass the legislation proposed by mayor rahm emanuel for a civilian office of police accountability (copa). copa is a fake police accountability bill. it replaces the independent police review authority (ipra), but the only change is the name. ipra reviewed 400 cases of police shootings of civilians over seven years, and found only one of them to be unjustified. nothing more needs to be said to prove that it was designed to cover up police crimes. copa is the same as ipra because it leaves the power of appointment of those responsible for holding the police accountable in the hands of the mayor. “civilian oversight” means that the mayor would appoint civilians who support his program. emanuel is not a social reformer. he’s an accessory to the murder of 17-year-old laquan mcdonald. he covered up the video of the racist cop, jason van dyke, in order to get re-elected. he cannot hold the police accountable. as expected, the mayor’s proposal passed city council. chicago politicians think that if they hold out long enough, if they starve us for justice long enough, the community will

Article 8 - obama tries to turn another tragedy into political opportunity
obama tries to turn another tragedy into political opportunity (before it's news) on thursday night, 15-year-0ld zaevion dobson was murdered in knoxville, tennessee. the murder was both senseless and banal as most shooting deaths are. earlier in the evening another woman had been shot and wounded in an apparent gang-related attack. her son and a friend drove to the neighborhood where they believed the attacker(s) lived and carried out some random shootings. dobson was sitting on front porch of his home with a group of friends when the shooters rolled up; dobson stood between the shooters and his friends when the shooters opened fire. he was killed but his friends were able to escape. two men have been arrested, one of them, a convicted felon, has been charged with the murder. the story has two points. first, it underscores the different nature of gun deaths in predominantly black communities and white communities. the washington post ran a story headlined the shocking difference in how blacks and whites are killed by guns the day after martin was murdered. he wasn’t mentioned in the story but he would have been an apt metaphor for the point the story made: the gun control debate often plays out in monolithic fashion in this country. the traditional understanding is that there’s one overarching problem — gun violence — that can be addressed by a more or less uniform set of solutions: better background checks, improved technology, etc. this approach makes a lot of sense.

Article 1 - detroit’s mayor will leave office and go to jail
“moving forward will require all of us to put aside the anger and bitterness of the past few months,” said mr. cockrel, 42, “and heal as a community.” mr. cockrel, whose father, a civil rights activist, died in 1989 before he could achieve his own mayoral aspirations and whose stepmother is a current council member, said chief among his responsibilities would be “restoring the credibility of not only the mayor but also of the city of detroit.” in an evening address from his office, an upbeat mr. kilpatrick took a parting swipe at ms. granholm. he also acknowledged what he called his “poor judgment,” asked the city to throw its support behind mr. cockrel and gave a litany of his achievements. “i want to emphasize tonight that i take full responsibility for my own actions,” he said. “i wish with all my heart that we could turn back the hands of time and tell that young man to make better choices. but i can’t. our challenge now is to put the anguish and turmoil of recent months behind us and join in a common cause to love our city, to love one another and move forward together.” police chief ella bully-cummings, a mayoral appointee, announced her retirement immediately after mr. kilpatrick’s plea, and a host of other city officials and staff members are expected to leave their jobs. it all adds up to a tremendous amount of tumult for a poverty-stricken

Article 2 - ferguson approves a federal plan to overhaul police and courts
“i know that this has been a long journey for all of us, but i am so looking forward to the opportunity for the city to turn this page,” cassandra butler, a ferguson resident, told the council. but after the vote, some members warned of jumping ahead. “this is just one step,” councilman dwayne t. james said. “we still have a lot of work to do.” after the vote, michael brown sr., whose son’s killing by a police officer here in august 2014 set off national unrest, shook hands with mayor james knowles iii and said thanks. “it’s beautiful,” mr. brown said in an interview. “it’s a good feeling. it let me know that, at the end of the day, you still have to make choices, and hopefully they’re the good choices.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the reforms include changing policies on stun guns and on shooting at moving vehicles, repealing questionable laws and carrying out new guidelines for stops and searches by local law enforcement. the city must also hire an independent monitor to ensure that the changes are enacted

Article 3 - giuliani cites criminal past of slain man
and at home in new york city, mr. giuliani's remarks drew immediate condemnations from some of his traditional critics, like the manhattan borough president, c. virginia fields, and the rev. al sharpton. mr. giuliani's comments on ''fox news sunday'' were his most extensive to date about the shooting. the mayor said that he had authorized commissioner howard safir on thursday to disclose mr. dorismond's criminal record, which consisted of arrests in 1987, 1993 and 1996, on charges of robbery, assault, attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon. ''if you read the man's background -- arrested for robbery, arrested for attempted robbery, arrested for assaulting someone in a driving dispute, arrested for assaulting someone in a marijuana dispute, with calls to his home for other disputes -- it is a pretty bad record,'' mr. giuliani said yesterday in a news conference after appearing at the st. patrick's day parade in buffalo. mr. giuliani said it was not that relevant that mr. dorismond's only convictions in the public record were for two disorderly conduct charges, given that ''usually it is a plea down from a more serious charge.'' the mayor also defended the police department and the officers involved in the incident, largely adopting the version of events offered by the police and a lawyer for detective anthony vasquez, the 29-year-old officer who fired the fatal shot.

the authorities said the children were told to stay away from the windows while the police searched the area for the assailant. the police said there had been no arrests and they had no suspects by late wednesday night. even in irvington, where crime is so prevalent that state troopers have at times been called in to patrol alongside local officers, the shooting, its circumstances and its location jarred many residents. “it’s deteriorating a lot around here,” chris colon, 37, said as he watched investigators remove yellow police tape from the scene. “they used to say it’s not safe to walk around here at night. now people are getting killed at 2 o’clock in the afternoon.” the mayor of irvington, wayne smith, said that the city’s murder rate had fallen in recent months and that the case would be a priority for investigators here. “you’re disheartened whenever an act of violence like this occurs, especially when it involves a loss of life,” mr. smith said in a telephone interview wednesday night. “this one warrants special investigation.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times

Article 5 - cyrus vance jr.’s ‘moneyball’ approach to crime
but vance’s most significant initiative, one that has been emulated in jurisdictions from brooklyn to san francisco, has been to transform, through the use of data, the way district attorneys fight crime. “the question i had when i came in was, do we sit on our hands waiting for crime to tick up, or can we do something to drive crime lower?” vance told me one afternoon in his eighth-floor office at the criminal courts building in lower manhattan. “i wanted to develop what i call intelligence-driven prosecution.” preparing to run in 2009, vance studied “community-based prosecution” programs in washington and consulted with experts in milwaukee and san francisco. the concept of expanding prosecution strategies to address neighborhood concerns emerged in the early 1990s as prosecutors and police departments grappled with an epidemic of violence, drug abuse and “quality of life” issues. inspired by “broken windows” policing strategies advocated by william j. bratton, who at the time was head of the city’s transit cops and is now the new york city police commissioner, d.a.s began to prosecute offenses once considered small potatoes. the iconic example in new york was the campaign against the “squeegee men” cleaning car windshields when drivers were trapped in traffic. the community focus was effective as far as it went, but there had been a revolution in the use of data over the last 20 years in areas as disparate as retailing, baseball

Article 6 - philadelphia defends policy on frisking, with limits
yet finding the right balance has not been easy. city officials have watched in frustration as homicides have continued to climb. as of late tuesday, 189 people had been killed in the city this year, compared with 169 at the same time in 2011. in most cases, police commissioner charles h. ramsey said, both the victims and the perpetrators have been black or hispanic men. “i think we have to face some realities,” said commissioner ramsey, who is black. “we certainly do not want to be stopping people without the reasonable suspicion that we need to conduct a stop. but just because someone is complaining and they want to play the race card doesn’t mean it’s an inappropriate stop.” the total number of stops, he said, is not the issue. “the question is: are you stopping the right people for the right reason?” philadelphia, like new york, increased the use of the stop-and-frisk tactic, arguing that it would help remove guns from the streets and serve as a deterrent. in his 2007 mayoral campaign, mr. nutter promised to use the strategy to help combat a “crime emergency” in some neighborhoods. that year, police officers made 136,711 pedestrian stops. two years after mr. nutter was elected, in 2009, the number nearly doubled to 253,276 — higher proportionally, in a city of 1.5 million, than the 685,724 stops made

Article 7 - court observers learn stories behind new york’s jaywalkers and subway scufflers
the monitoring program has not coincidentally ramped up at a moment when violent crime in new york has reached historic lows. despite a recent uptick in homicides and shootings, the city’s crime rate remains remarkably far below its apex in the early 1990s and, in this atmosphere of relative security, the policy debate about policing has shifted away from felonies to less severe, quality-of-life crimes. in april, police commissioner william j. bratton issued a report, “broken windows and quality-of-life policing in new york city,” which defended cracking down on minor violations and argued that crime had decreased greatly in direct proportion to the issuances of summonses and misdemeanor arrests. one of his report’s key findings was that more than half of those brought up on misdemeanor charges in the city were potential recidivists with a prior record of more serious felony arrests. opposing mr. bratton that same month, melissa mark-viverito, the city council speaker, announced a proposal to decriminalize a host of small offenses, like public urination and being in a park after dark. and just three weeks ago, the brooklyn district attorney’s office held an amnesty day at a church in clinton hill, at which hundreds of people with outstanding warrants for petty violations were allowed — by simply showing up — to wipe them off the books. soon, mayor bill de blasio will join the conversation. in the coming weeks, he is expected to release his own plan about

Article 8 - chicago makes another effort to disrupt gangs
''it's a good thing, but at the same time it doesn't solve the root of the problem,'' said sister rayo cuaya-castillo of holy trinity croatian church, a half-block from 18th and throop. sister cuaya-castillo said that after the arrests, gang members returned to the corner and there was shooting that night and the next. ultimately, she said, gangs might ''move to another neighborhood'' but ''they will continue to do the same thing.'' under the old anti-loitering ordinance, ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court last year, the police arrested more than 42,000 people. that measure made it a crime for anyone standing with a suspected gang member to ''remain in any one place with no apparent purpose'' after a police order to disperse. ''it matters not,'' wrote justice john paul stevens in the 6-to-3 opinion that struck down the ordinance, ''whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near wrigley field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of sammy sosa leaving the ballpark.'' newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an

Title: detroit sweats while it waits for electricity
Content: ''the party has to happen in your homes tonight,'' the mayor said at an afternoon news conference outside police headquarters in the eerily quiet and empty downtown. ''continue your family time. love thy neighbor -- in your own home, your own neighborhood.'' thrilled that the number of arrests was at a typical level through the first 24 hours of the nation's worst blackout, detroit officials said the weekend would serve as a referendum on mayor kilpatrick's leadership and on his efforts to rehabilitate detroit's reputation, from that of a city decimated by violence and poverty to that of a cultural hub with a revitalized economy. ''either the people of this city believe in this city's future and are going to rally around this mayor or they're not,'' said michael duggan, the county prosecutor, who stood with mr. kilpatrick and mr. oliver at the news conference. although city officials said there had been virtually no violence or looting thursday night or friday, mr. duggan issued a stern warning to residents of a city still scarred from the riots of the 1960's. noting that civil disobedience felonies carry a 10-year prison term, mr. duggan added, ''before you pick up a brick and throw it, before you tip over a car, before you take a tv, you better ask yourself, is this worth 10 years of my life?'' elsewhere in the midwest, gov. bob taft of ohio declared a state of emergency in cuyahoga county, which includes cleveland, where an order to boil the city's water was in effect through sunday, though power had been restored by midafternoon to nearly all the 1.5 million area residents who had lost it and to the city's four water pumping stations. in akron, power was restored in all but a four-block area by 11 a.m., and the mayor sent water and engineers to help cleveland. neighboring cuyahoga falls, population 50,000, never lost power. ''it was almost like when you land in las vegas and see all the lights,'' the mayor, don robart, said of driving home to cuyahoga falls from akron, in a telephone call to national public radio. ''it was nice to come home to.'' in melvindale, mich., a detroit suburb, 2,000 people were shut out of their homes until 1:35 p.m., after an explosion at an oil refinery on thursday night caused by a buildup of pressure inside a boiler. it appeared unrelated to the blackout but compounded the misery. advertisement continue reading the main story across the region the blackout caused all sorts of disruptions and inconvenience and prompted a variety of improvised remedies. at st. joseph mercy hospital in ann arbor, mich., robert moore, a courier, got stuck in traffic while trying to pick up platelets for a cancer patient. he

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Recent articles highlight various issues in the United States. In Detroit, a ""bankruptcy"" has been implemented under Public Act 436, allowing an unelected official to establish local law by decree, contravening the Michigan Constitution. The city's recent bankruptcy eligibility was achieved despite Governor Snyder defying a court order.

A Workers Inquiry into the Bankruptcy of Detroit is being held to uncover the social and historical roots of the city's financial crisis and expose the political interests behind it. The plan for adjustment, worked out with creditors, aims to gut pensions and health benefits for over 20,000 retired workers and privatize public assets.

Gun control advocates are pushing for the government to reward firearms manufacturers that acquiesce to ""voluntary"" gun control measures, while punishing those that refuse. Metro-IAF wants to inject gun control politics into federal firearms acquisition procedures.

Walter Williams explains how liberalism's focus on targeted groups ultimately harms society, using Detroit as an example of how a city's decline can be attributed to political favoritism and tax policies against higher-income residents.

The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) has been organizing against police crimes for decades. After the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the alliance sees a spark for community control of the police.

There are no significant contradictions or claims that are not supported by the article. The only minor discrepancy is the mention of Kevin Garnett scoring 30 points in one game, whereas the article states he scored 31 points. However, this difference does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","Here's a concise summary of the articles:

The New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets have already developed a lackluster rivalry, with the Knicks winning their first two games against the Nets. Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks to an 89-86 win over the Boston Celtics, snapping their 11-game losing streak at TD Garden.

In contrast, the Eastern Conference NBA draft final report card revealed that many teams made smart decisions and no major trades went down. The Fab Melo pick was also criticized for being uneventful.

Knicks fans have already forgotten about Jeremy Lin, with only 1% of surveyed fans knowing what ""Linsanity"" means. Meanwhile, Kevin Garnett still haunts the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have struggled to win games since his departure in 2007.

The NBA playoffs featured some impressive dunks, including Kevin Johnson's posterizing dunk on Hakeem Olajuwon and Kobe Bryant's highlight-reel slam.

The Boston Celtics' chances of winning this season are uncertain due to the NBA lockout. The team has struggled without their ""Big Three"" since 2007, and their recent performance has been disappointing.

Finally, the Cleveland Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics 103-91, with Paul Pierce scoring a season-high 40 points on 13-of-16 shooting from the field and 6-of-7 from downtown.","The New York Knicks have been struggling, with inconsistent performances and a 25-39 record. In a recent game against the Boston Celtics, coach Stan Van Gundy attributed their loss to not playing smart enough and failing to sustain what worked offensively. The Celtics took control of the game, led by Kevin Garnett's 30 points and Rajon Rondo's 25 points and 8 assists.

In another game, the Knicks came alive and rallied past the Cleveland Cavaliers, with Allan Houston scoring a game-high 28 points. The team showed signs of life, but still have a long way to go to reach their playoff potential.

Coach Mike D'Antoni has won only 35 of 99 games with the Knicks, raising questions about his long-term blueprint for restructuring and whether his offense is universal or tailored for specific players. Despite this, he remains committed to winning now.

The Knicks ended an encouraging month on a sour note, losing to the Brooklyn Nets. David Lee had 24 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 assists, but the team struggled with seven turnovers in the fourth quarter.

In a recent game against the Boston Celtics, Carmelo Anthony scored 31 points, including consecutive layups that gave the Knicks an 80-70 lead. He vowed to keep quiet around Tony Brothers, who ejected him from a game earlier in the week due to successive technicals for arguing.

The Nets got revenge on the Celtics two nights later, beating them 111-101 at home. Brook Lopez had 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Jarrett Jack scored 13 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - knicks-nets rivalry already over
new york — it’s only been about two months into the brooklyn nets era, but their rivalry with the knicks has already disappeared. or, as knicks fan katie mansfield described it, “it’s faded away down one of those dark, eerie streets you’re too afraid to go down when you’re deep in brooklyn.” the nets pulled off a tough overtime win over the knicks in their first game together, but the knicks won the next two outings over brooklyn. carmelo anthony scored 45 and 31 points in each of those wins. “if you’re the nets, it has to be disheartening to already know that carmelo will be embarrassing you for many years to come,” said knicks fan tristan patel. “it’s becoming very much like the ‘chipper jones-mets’ relationship… yeah, that brutal.” “my big brother used to do dangerous wrestling moves on me when i was little and forced me to suck the teat of the cows in our family barn,” said nets owner mikhail prokhorov. “now it feels like that nightmare is happening all over again with the knicks.” there seems to be a severe lack of rivalry even between knick and net fans. “that’s probably because there are no nets fans,” argues patel. “the knicks being better than the nets right isn’t even enjoyable because there are no net fans to humiliate. even when you think

(before it's news) new york knicks forward carmelo anthony secured one of the most satisfying victories of his career against the boston celtics, leading his team to an 89-86 road win at the td garden. the knicks’ 89-86 triumph thursday night snapped their 11-game losing streak at boston and also was a measure of revenge for a defeat against the celtics at madison square garden on jan. 7, when anthony jawed both on and off the court with veteran kevin garnett and earned himself a one-game suspension. the teams’ latest meeting was a shenanigan-free, defensive-minded contest that was not decided until late in the fourth quarter, when the celtics shot themselves in the foot with turnovers on two of their last three possessions. anthony led the way for the knicks with 28 points, his 27th straight game with at least 20 points dating back to nov. 16. the star forward, who was booed throughout the night by the celtics’ fans, also hauled down nine rebounds. in the teams’ previous game, anthony was so rattled by garnett’s trash-talking that he waited outside the celtics’ bus after the contest in a bid to continue his war of words with

new york — with the new york knicks’ hot start to the season, knicks fans are asking, “jeremy who?” knicks fans were recently asked how the excitement of this season’s beginning compares to the ‘linsanity’ of last season. it’s clear that jeremy lin is an out-of-reach memory in the minds of knicks fans. one hundred percent of knicks fans surveyed didn’t know what ‘linsanity’ meant, while twenty-one percent thought the interviewer just had a stroke. “who gives a shit about last season? we’ve been kicking ass this season!” said one excited fan. “jeremy lin?” responded another fan. “doesn’t ring a bell. he couldn’t be more entertaining than rasheed wallace though i bet! have you see him lug his way down the court? you never know if he’s gonna make it!” lin started his first nba game for the knicks in february of last season. he became a new york hero and nationwide phenomenon out of nowhere, recording one of the greatest starts to a career in nba history. but after failing to arrive at agreeable terms with knicks management this past off-season, lin signed with the houston rockets. his season has started very shaky, performing nowhere near his level of play last season. for many knicks fans, the disappointing end to last season seemed to have had a damaging effect to its charm. season-ticket holder eric bridgeman admits

garnett still haunts the wolves (before it's news) with another halloween come and gone, the garnett era continues to haunt the minnesota timberwolves. sure, the haunting coincides with the haunting of the mchale era, but the garnett era haunting still looms. after failing to supply kg with viable support pieces for 12 years, garnett was traded to the boston celtics and immediately won an nba championship. his bolt to the northeast put him in the company of david ortiz and doug mientkiewicz, who jetted from our norse state and won a championship with the red sox, and randy moss, who made his way to the patriots via oakland and came one incredible helmet catch away from a perfect 19-0 season. minnesota sports seems to have a thing for supplying the recent boston supremacy. it’s the garnett era, however, that still lingers throughout the state. after winning 32 games in kg’s final season, the wolves have yet to win more than 24 in any season since his 2007 departure. in fact, the wolves have won a total of 78 games in the four years since the garnett era. in a 9-year stretch prior to the 2005-06 season, the wolves averaged over 90 wins every two years. who knows if we’ll even reach that mark over the course of the five years since kg

nba basketball is great for many reasons, but at the top of the list is dunking. throughout all major sports, there’s nothing out there quite like dunking and a player just getting absolutely posterized. for some people, it’s the only reason to watch the game. but what’s more impressive than a good, old-fashioned dunk? well, obviously a slam in the nba playoffs that is so powerful it reverberates throughout the universe reminding the aliens from space jam never to f— with us again. there are always new rivalries brewing each year in the post-season, and one of the best ways to shut your opponent up is by throwing it down on them. from new names on the scene to michael jordan, there have been some utterly ridiculous dunks in nba playoff history. with that, let’s take a look at some of the very best of all time in the playoffs. 10. kevin johnson teams: phoenix suns vs. houston rockets game: 1994 western conference semifinals, game 4 before this game, you may not have heard too much about kevin johnson, but you knew his name afterward. johnson put his name on the nba playoff map after this unreal dunk on the man himself, hakeem olajuwon. he absolutely attacked the rim, sending the stadium and announcers into a frenzy. for that, he kicks off this list. 9. kobe bryant teams

Article 7 - nba lockout complete, so are the celtics’ chances
nba lockout complete, so are the celtics’ chances (before it's news) at this point, it seems as though the nba season is going to be a complete air ball. while nba fans from every market are disappointed, confused, and seriously contemplating joining the occupy movement, i think that boston celtic’s fans have a reason to be particularly disappointed. this is the end of the celtic’s as we’ve come to know them. while it’s hard for many to remember, before 2007 and the formulation of the big three, the celtics had squandered miserable season after miserable season away under the watchful eye of the garden’s championship banners. paul pierce offered some relief (god bless him for sticking around), but mostly we tuned in to watch antoine walker jack up countless threes. in 2007, danny ainge teamed up with paul pierce, ray allen, and kevin garnett to change all that. rajon rondo also joined the mix. a championship banner suddenly landed in the rafters, and expectations have been high ever since. i’ve said all along that this group is too good to have only won a single championship together, as they missed out on their second by blowing a 13-point lead to the lakers in the 4th quarter of the 2009-2010 nba finals. this year, i’ll argue, could have been the year. trust

Article 8 - catfish fry: pierce, c’s drop cavs
catfish fry: pierce, c’s drop cavs (before it's news) it was a typical night for the cavaliers wednesday in boston’s td garden. playing without the injuried anderson varejao and displaying its usual slipshod effort on both sides of the ball, cleveland dropped to 5-22 on the season with a 103-91 loss to the celtics. it was the fifth straight defeat for the cavaliers, who fell to 1-10 in the month of december. the game plan for cleveland on this night seemingly featured a determination to not guard paul pierce. apparently no one on the cavaliers either a.) studied film of the celtics or b.) watched an nba game after 1998. either way, the catfish was given one wide-open look after another, and he responded with a season-high 40 points on 13-of-16 from the field and 6-of-7 from downtown. pierce led the way to a scorching offensive night from the celtics, who got off at a 59.7 percent clip against cleveland’s lackluster-as-usual defense. source:

Article 1 - there's little to say in knicks' defense
''the thing about this team is most of us have been around each other for two, three or four years, and so we shouldn't be so inconsistent,'' said allan houston, who scored 23 points but gave up the bulk of mitch richmond's 32 points. ''we're playing like we just got together. we don't know what's going on out there. ''teams just don't shoot 60 percent. i think mitch hit a lot of tough shots, but it's not just him. if i look back at the tape and i see that he just made tough shots, fine. but i don't think myself or we made him take tough shots.'' in overtime, it was rod strickland who made the most devastating shots of all. in overtime, sprewell, who had scrambled to keep his team alive for four quarters, collapsed in the critical moments. the knicks had a 108-106 lead when sprewell zipped an ill-advised pass to the top of the key and watched as juwan howard turned it into a fast-break layup despite being fouled by charlie ward with 2 minutes 22 seconds left. sprewell had a chance to tie the game, but missed one of two free throws with 1:27 remaining. a possession later, strickland launched an arcing 17-footer over the outstretched hand of patrick ewing that fell softly into the net for a

Article 2 - the celtics take control with champions’ cool
the magic regained possession with 3.5 seconds left, and a desperation heave by jameer nelson fell short at the buzzer. “i thought we fought hard, but we didn’t play smart enough and we didn’t sustain what worked offensively,” magic coach stan van gundy said. the celtics, who led for most of the game, fell behind when carter hit a 20-foot jumper with 3 minutes 35 seconds left. kevin garnett answered, and rajon rondo, who continued his playoff excellence with 25 points and 8 assists, converted a layup. dwight howard, who had 30 points and 8 rebounds, played solidly after a poor game 1 and helped slice into boston’s 11-point fourth-quarter lead — to no avail. “we’re not taking good enough shots, and that’s the bottom line,” van gundy said. the celtics answered orlando’s runs with veteran poise and took a 70-60 lead when garnett reeled off 6 points and rondo added 2 more. photo “they brought the fight to us in a lot of ways, and i thought we withstood the hits,” celtics coach doc rivers said. if these celtics closely reflect their championship team of two years ago, pierce mirrored the scoring and the flair for the dramatic. he went on scoring sprees, accounting for boston’s first 9

Article 3 - knicks come alive and rally past cavaliers
somewhere in between lie the reasons for a 25-39 record. and what would be a cry for celebration in chicago still remains an indictment in new york. but the knicks are showing signs of the team they might have been. ''if we don't get the playoff spot, we still want to finish playing as if we're playing for a playoff spot,'' allan houston said, moments after making all five of his 3-point attempts and finishing with a game-high 28 points. jackson outplayed the younger and quicker andre miller, cleveland's floor leader. if miller came in with a right hip pointer, he left with a severely bruised ego. aside from being unable to thwart jackson, miller was in foul trouble all evening and finished only 3 of 10 from the field with 10 points and 11 assists. he let his frustration get the best of him, picking up a technical in the final minutes. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. with 1 minute 30 seconds left, cleveland coach john lucas was ejected by referee tim donaghy after receiving

Article 4 - wins count; d’antoni isn’t counting
in phoenix, the wins flowed easily. d’antoni compiled 232 in his last four seasons with the suns. but with the knicks, d’antoni has won only 35 of 99 games, bringing into question the organization’s long-term blueprint for restructuring and whether his offensive system is universal or tailored for specific players. “i’m fine with everything,” said d’antoni, who is firmly planted in the knicks’ future, a security blanket that few on his roster can claim. “it’s just i want to win right now, and we’re not winning, and that’s it.” photo the knicks are showing incremental signs of life. they matched paces against quality teams like the denver nuggets on friday and the magic on sunday. but both games ended with the familiarity of defeat. orlando entered the fourth quarter with an 83-72 lead before nate robinson began flashing in and out of the lane for a series of short jumpers. he scored 9 of the knicks’ first 10 baskets and 22 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. the sequence was dazzling but inconsequential. in the span, the magic expanded its lead. while robinson scored, the magic spread the ball and the court. vince carter intercepted jared jeffries’s pass, for example, turning it into a layup, while rashard lewis made his fifth 3-pointer and dwight howard out

Article 5 - victory for anthony and for knicks
in the fourth quarter, anthony went right by garnett on the baseline and scored on a layup that gave the knicks an 80-70 lead, their biggest of the game. he produced his most impressive plays in the final minutes by passing to teammates. photo the celtics (20-22), who entered the game on a four-game losing streak, were determined not to let anthony score. he was content to pass out of double teams, which led to open shots for teammates. j. r. smith was a star in the final minutes. he swished a 3-pointer — his only one of the game — with 1 minute 11 seconds left to give the knicks an 89-84 lead. before that shot, smith was 2 for 15. “well, i was seeing the double team all night,” anthony said. “it was easy. when you see the double team, swing, swing, and it’s just a matter of guys making shots and j. r. made that big 3 for us.” tyson chandler said anthony handled the game and the circumstances well. “he responded exactly the way he was supposed to,” chandler said. “the best way to feel like you get some giveback is by getting a victory.” jason kidd, who was once the main target of the boston crowd in 2002, said anthony handled himself well. in fact, kidd said the knicks

Article 6 - nets end knicks&#8217; month on a sour note
david lee had 24 points, 15 rebounds and 8 assists for the knicks (12-20), who ended an encouraging month on a sour note. they joined charlotte and chicago as the only teams to lose to the nets this season. “we can’t worry about their record,” said jared jeffries, who battled foul trouble all night. “they’re all n.b.a. players. and it’s not like we’re the lakers and we’re 22-5. we need to win games like this.” the nets led by as many as 18 points in the second half. the knicks, despite seven turnovers in the fourth quarter, stayed close enough to pull out the win. danilo gallinari made consecutive 3-pointers to cut the deficit to 11 points with 5 minutes 5 seconds left. the rally sputtered when chris duhon missed a 3-pointer and lee had a layup blocked by lopez. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. a night after routing the pistons on the road, the knicks played like a fatig

Title: adding the fire to a simmering feud
Content: of course, even without the anthony-garnett issue to consider, a celtics-knicks contest is never just another game, especially in a season in which the knicks are resurgent and threatening to end boston’s primacy in the atlantic division. photo but beyond that, who knows? the celtics’ crowd can be a tough one, but no tougher than some others in the n.b.a. and not any more likely to jump on an opposing player. what is part of the record, though, is that one of anthony’s teammates, jason kidd, received very tough treatment in boston during the 2002 postseason. then the point guard and leader of a vibrant new jersey nets team, kidd heard chants of “wife beater” from celtics fans, who were intent on delivering a nasty reminder that kidd, nearly a year and a half earlier, had been arrested on a charge of spousal abuse involving his wife, joumana, to whom he is no longer married. joumana kidd was in attendance in boston as the shouts came from the stands. so was their son, t. j., who was then 3. it was a tough scene, an ugly one, and when kidd and the nets prevailed in game 4 in boston to even the series at two games apiece, he defiantly celebrated on the court, staring into the crowd and holding up two fingers on each hand to remind the fans the series was tied. afterward, he admitted to having shouted profanities, too. when asked about that incident this week, kidd said: “no matter what they scream or what is done, you have to go out and play. if you have rabbit ears, it may get to you, but if you don’t, it’s just another game on the road.” referring to anthony and what might await him in boston on thursday, kidd added: “he’s one of the top players in the world. he’s been heckled on the road before, in college and now in the n.b.a. it’s nothing new.” advertisement continue reading the main story chuck mckenney, a co-founder of redsarmy.com, a celtics fan web site, predicted that boston fans would boo anthony during introductions on thursday night, when he went to the free-throw line, when he had the ball and when he did not. photo “we don’t have a lot of respect for melo,” mckenney said in a telephone interview. “we kind of feel like he’s always been a second-tier superstar, overpaid, not really capable of carrying a team to a championship. “but just because we want to dismiss him doesn’t mean we’re not going to come out with a lot of vitriol and just let him have it.” on the other hand, anthony might be a bigger target than ever for celt

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The New York Knicks have been struggling, with inconsistent performances and a 25-39 record. In a recent game against the Boston Celtics, coach Stan Van Gundy attributed their loss to not playing smart enough and failing to sustain what worked offensively. The Celtics took control of the game, led by Kevin Garnett's 30 points and Rajon Rondo's 25 points and 8 assists.

In another game, the Knicks came alive and rallied past the Cleveland Cavaliers, with Allan Houston scoring a game-high 28 points. The team showed signs of life, but still have a long way to go to reach their playoff potential.

Coach Mike D'Antoni has won only 35 of 99 games with the Knicks, raising questions about his long-term blueprint for restructuring and whether his offense is universal or tailored for specific players. Despite this, he remains committed to winning now.

The Knicks ended an encouraging month on a sour note, losing to the Brooklyn Nets. David Lee had 24 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 assists, but the team struggled with seven turnovers in the fourth quarter.

In a recent game against the Boston Celtics, Carmelo Anthony scored 31 points, including consecutive layups that gave the Knicks an 80-70 lead. He vowed to keep quiet around Tony Brothers, who ejected him from a game earlier in the week due to successive technicals for arguing.

The Nets got revenge on the Celtics two nights later, beating them 111-101 at

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here's a concise summary of the articles:

The New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets have already developed a lackluster rivalry, with the Knicks winning their first two games against the Nets. Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks to an 89-86 win over the Boston Celtics, snapping their 11-game losing streak at TD Garden.

In contrast, the Eastern Conference NBA draft final report card revealed that many teams made smart decisions and no major trades went down. The Fab Melo pick was also criticized for being uneventful.

Knicks fans have already forgotten about Jeremy Lin, with only 1% of surveyed fans knowing what ""Linsanity"" means. Meanwhile, Kevin Garnett still haunts the Minnesota Timberwolves, who have struggled to win games since his departure in 2007.

The NBA playoffs featured some impressive dunks, including Kevin Johnson's posterizing dunk on Hakeem Olajuwon and Kobe Bryant's highlight-reel slam.

The Boston Celtics' chances of winning this season are uncertain due to the NBA lockout. The team has struggled without their ""Big Three"" since 2007, and their recent performance has been disappointing.

Finally, the Cleveland Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics 103-91, with Paul Pierce scoring a season-high 40 points on 13-of-16 shooting from the field and 6-of-7 from downtown.

(before it's news) new york democrat attorney general eric schneiderman is the hack-est of hacks. a leftist ideologue to the point of derangement – and complete dereliction of his actual duty. rather than looking after the legal needs of the residents of the empire state, schneiderman has spent much of his time tilting at climate change windmills – embodied mostly by a years-long persecution of oil company exxonmobil. schneiderman has engaged in all of this nonsense as his part in a larger leftist campaign: “(t)wo rockefeller family foundations have been involved in an advocacy campaign that accuses exxonmobil of covering up what it knew about climate change….rockefeller foundations have funded journalism enterprises that have produced stories that overlap with the advocacy agenda….and this cavalcade of fake news served as the precursor to the new york state attorney general eric schneiderman-led years-long very real legal persecution of exxonmobil. which is simply the next phase of the rockefeller foundation’s calculated assault against exxonmobil. for having the audacity to engage in legal commerce – providing our nation a vital resource.” want some irony? this whole anti-exxon assault is allegedly predicated upon exxon “covering up what it knew about climate change.” so how hilarious is it – that

a name game with the old masters image a 15th-century wooden putto that was recently attributed to donatello. credit todd heisler/the new york times london — one of the problems for a billionaire wanting to put together a trophy collection of old master art is that the supply of documented works by the most illustrious sculptors and painters has all but dried up. as a result, millions can be made if a work hitherto attributed to a minor or unknown artist can be upgraded to a famous name. just such an “attributional upgrade” was rewarded on jan. 4, when the new york dealer and renaissance scholar andrew butterfield found a buyer for a 15th-century gilded wooden putto that he described in its accompanying catalog as a “newly identified statue by donatello.” speaking on condition of anonymity, three people with knowledge of the sale said the buyer was jon landau, the longtime manager of bruce springsteen and a prominent collector of italian renaissance art. the transaction, involving a part exchange of works that mr. landau had bought from mr. butterfield, was worth $8 million to $11 million, those people said. the possible reattribution was first reported last fall in the new york times. mr. butterfield declined to comment on the price or the buyer’s identity. when contacted by email, mr. landau replied, “i simply have no comment.” the path to such reattribution

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to ban breastfeeding over 16 ounces, and has ordered city-owned hospitals to lock up baby formula. He also plans to limit sugary drinks to 16 fluid ounces.

In San Francisco, Acting Mayor London Breed honored Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy and reported progress in supporting homeless and immigrant communities.

Democrat Bill de Blasio's campaign for NYC mayor was inspired by Marxists, including Nicaragua's Sandinista movement.

Reform Party candidate Carl Person plans to spend taxpayer money on residents and voters instead of special interests, with a 1-year job training program for high school seniors.

The Washington Post reported that five Democrats are backing independent candidate David Catania in the DC mayoral election.

Following the execution of two NYPD officers, traffic tickets and summonses have dropped by 94% as officers feel betrayed by the mayor and fear for their safety. The city is holding an emergency summit to address the rift between cops and the administration.

Former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley announced his campaign for President, framing the election in dire economic terms and arguing that income inequality is a major issue.","In 2017, billionaire John Catsimatidis considered running against Mayor Bill de Blasio. He stated that if he decided to run, he would be a Republican and a liberal, focusing on public safety and helping people from the inner city.

De Blasio reacted to the Garner case, citing ""black lives matter"" without explicitly denouncing the grand jury's decision. He acknowledged protests but urged New Yorkers to avoid violence.

In Quinn Country, de Blasio campaigned at Christine Quinn's neighborhood subway stop, meeting residents and taking pictures with children. He also spent time rallying his base, including a rally at the Stonewall Inn.

De Blasio's rise as Public Advocate was remarkable, appealing to struggling New Yorkers who see a city of wealth rising out of their reach. He won the Democratic nomination without a runoff and is polling ahead of Republican candidate Joseph Lhota.

In a presidential forum, de Blasio has not endorsed Hillary Clinton, citing her need to fill in policy blanks. He plans to sponsor a presidential forum with Representative David Loebsack and has expressed interest in attracting candidates like Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley.

A poll found that de Blasio holds a huge lead in the mayoral race, with about two-thirds of voters still undecided. His challengers, including Ms. Malliotakis and Mr. Dietl, will debate him on October 10.

Donald Trump's influence in New York is limited, despite his deep roots in the city. His real estate holdings are modest, and he does not belong to trade groups like the Real Estate Board of New York or the Association for a Better New York.

The Housing Authority has faced issues with lead paint failure, prompting calls for federal oversight and the firing of Chairwoman Shola Olatoye.

unlike peers in city and state government who also spoke on wednesday, mr. de blasio did not explicitly denounce the grand jury’s decision in the garner case. and he did not demand a federal investigation of the case, saying only that “there are more chapters ahead.” but he cited the rallying cry of protesters across the country — “black lives matter” — in a manner that signaled his tacit support. “they said it because it has to be said,” he said. “it’s a phrase that should never have to be said. it should be self-evident, but our history sadly requires us to say it.” mr. de blasio’s rhetorical strength is an ability to project empathy, and as he spoke for 20 minutes on wednesday, flanked by clergy leaders and elected officials, he seemed to be trying to preside over the day’s events, rather than to steer them. he acknowledged there would be protests, and urged new yorkers to avoid violence. he praised william j. bratton, his police commissioner, as an agent of change, but — aware that some liberals are skeptical of mr. bratton’s approach — also said that mr. bratton would not abide brutality or racism on the force. mr. de blasio began preparing his speech over the weekend, dictating general ideas and specific phrases to senior staff members, aides said. he chose to focus on his son because it was consistent with the personal approach

Article 3 - de blasio goes stumping in quinn country
photo an increasingly confident bill de blasio on friday ventured into the home territory of one of his main rivals, campaigning at christine c. quinn’s neighborhood subway stop. mr. de blasio, a democratic candidate for mayor, was mobbed by chelsea residents who wanted to shake his hand and take pictures of him with their children. “now i can say i’ve met the mayor,” one boy said. a man gushed about how he had just been telling some women on the bus that mr. de blasio, the public advocate, was going to win the election. “i took out my crystal ball, and i see that you will become mayor,” he said, laughing. ms. quinn, the city council speaker, and william c. thompson jr., the city comptroller and another democratic candidate, spent friday concentrating on rallying their bases — ms. quinn with a boisterous rally at the stonewall inn, and mr. thompson with a series of appearances in the bronx. at the same time, mr. de blasio seemed to be trying to expand his base, and with an unrelenting focus on ms. quinn. advertisement continue reading the main story his appearance at ms. quinn’s local subway stop, at west 23rd street and eighth avenue, came hours after capital new york published on its web site a video showing mr. de blasio putting his arm around a man wearing a red t-shirt that

Article 4 - bill de blasio for mayor
the rise of bill de blasio, new york city’s public advocate, has been remarkable. in a clamorous primary campaign against better known, more seasoned candidates, he won the democratic nomination without a runoff, by appealing directly and doggedly to struggling new yorkers who see a city of lofty wealth rising out of their reach. with the election only 10 days away, mr. de blasio is polling so far ahead of the republican, joseph lhota, that commentators have already anointed him leader of a national rebirth of left-wing populism. hold on. we’re electing a mayor here, someone to keep streets plowed and safe, budgets balanced, schools working well and constituents of five boroughs satisfied. someone to sustain and build on the 12-year legacy of michael bloomberg, while realizing his own vision for new york. it’s a huge job, never mind the revolution. luckily, mr. de blasio is up for it. during the democratic primary scramble, the largest and most rancorous in decades, we gave our endorsement to christine quinn, citing her record as the city council speaker. but it was mr. de blasio who proved far better at connecting with voters — and at being a persuasive advocate for his ideas. the ideas are good ones: mr. de blasio is right on public safety, and on the need to rein in the police department’s unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk tactics and restore its frayed ties

Article 5 - de blasio returning to the national political stage
for some democrats, the forum may highlight a sore point: mr. de blasio has continued to withhold an endorsement of his former boss and a fellow democrat, hillary rodham clinton. the mayor said on cnbc this week that mrs. clinton still needs “to fill in the blanks” on some policy plans before he can support her presidential bid. even some of the mayor’s close supporters have wondered why he is delaying an endorsement. but staying neutral could help mr. de blasio attract more candidates to the planned presidential forum in indianola, iowa, which he plans to sponsor with representative david loebsack, an iowa democrat. so far, senator bernie sanders, an independent from vermont, and martin o’malley, a democratic candidate from maryland, have expressed interest in participating. a representative for mrs. clinton did not respond to an inquiry on wednesday. city hall officials say that with a presidential election looming, mr. de blasio cares deeply about focusing the political dialogue on policies that he believes can help combat inequality, like eliminating tax loopholes for the income of some investment managers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred

so far, the mayor has not outlined a robust second-term agenda beyond continuing and expanding initiatives from his first four years, and he has allowed his staff and volunteers to mind his campaign. mr. de blasio has instead made himself more visible through mayoral work in communities, including accelerating the pace of town-hall meetings around the city. the first of two debates, on oct. 10, will feature the mayor, ms. malliotakis and mr. dietl. for both challengers, the debate could provide a crucial chance to jump-start their campaigns. the poll of 731 city voters, which had a margin of error of nearly five percentage points, found that about two-thirds of those surveyed still did not know enough about either to form an opinion. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. ms. malliotakis, who has struggled variously to explain and distance herself from a republican president deeply unpopular in new york, polled better than mr. de blasio in only one place: the more conservative borough of staten island.

donald trump in new york: deep roots, but little influence image donald j. trump’s organization manages the wollman ice skating rink in central park. credit edward caruso for the new york times it is impossible to miss when you fly into new york city and spot the golf course in the shadow of the whitestone bridge. it is hard to avoid when you stroll along fifth avenue, or venture past the skating rink or carousel in central park. and it is there in bright lights, no less, when you pass the sleek hotel near the entrance to the holland tunnel: the name of donald j. trump. mr. trump has embraced his roots as a new yorker as being crucial to his presidential bid, and in so doing, the republican candidate has given the impression as he crossed the country that he is a force to reckon with in the city of his birth. but while trump remains a visible brand name around the city’s five boroughs, it is much harder to discern his imprint as a classic power broker, someone who is feared and can make things happen with a phone call or a quiet aside with the right person at the right time. his real estate holdings in new york are modest; he did not make the top 10 in lists of major condominium developers and power players in real estate in the city, as judged by several publications. he does not belong to trade groups like the real estate board of new york or the association for a better new york.

Title: de blasio campaigns less as quinn steps up her pace
Content: for most of the summer, bill de blasio maintained a robust public appearance schedule as he ran across new york city in an attempt to meet voters. on an average day, mr. de blasio could be found greeting commuters at subway stations in the morning, visiting with people at senior centers during lunch and holding news conferences later in the day to introduce initiatives or proposals he would follow as mayor. but as the summer winds down and the democratic primary on sept. 10 draws near, mr. de blasio has sharply reduced his scheduled public appearances, just as his rivals, most notably christine c. quinn, the city council speaker, make a last-ditch effort to close the growing margin in the polls that he enjoys. mr. de blasio, who averaged 35 to 40 public events per week since mid-july, has made only 9 public appearances since monday, with no campaign appearances on friday. his campaign denied any change in practice. “bill de blasio has been out talking to voters and taking questions from the media every single day for months, and that will continue through election day and beyond,” said dan levitan, a spokesman for the de blasio campaign. by contrast, ms. quinn held 41 scheduled public appearances between monday and friday, more than in any other week in the past two months, according to an analysis of her campaign and council calendars. william c. thompson jr., who is vying with mr. de blasio and ms. quinn for one of the two spots in a possible runoff, held 22 events during the same window. ms. quinn held a five-borough tour on monday in honor of women’s equality day and brought out her father, lawrence p. quinn, to campaign with her at senior centers throughout the week. she even made it to the bay terrace community alliance’s annual candidate forum on tuesday, after being chided earlier this month for her lack of appearances at community mayoral forums compared with the other major democratic candidates. “if you want to be mayor, you need to make your case to the people you want to represent,” said mike morey, spokesman for the quinn campaign. “from now until election day, christine quinn intends to continuing doing just that, making the case if you want a progressive mayor who can deliver, she’s your gal.”

the space agency has sent orbiters to five planets — mercury, venus, mars, jupiter and saturn — but it will most likely be another decade or two before a spacecraft enters orbit around uranus or neptune. (a study on future planetary missions put a uranus orbiter on the wish list.) nasa does have a spacecraft, new horizons, that will zoom past pluto in 2015, but, alas, pluto is no longer counted as a planet. mercury has been seen close up, albeit briefly, in half a dozen flybys by nasa probes: three by the mariner 10 in the 1970s and three by the messenger in the last three years. but now that the messenger has pulled into an orbit of mercury, planetary scientists will be able to get their first long look at the smallest of the eight planets. the day side of mercury can broil at 800 degrees fahrenheit; the night side drops to minus 300 degrees. particularly intriguing, scientists say, are the shadows in craters near mercury’s poles. there, the sun never shines, and in the frigidity, some scientists expect that the messenger will find frozen water. photo the messenger arrived at its final destination after a 6.5-year loop the loop through the inner solar system. a 15-minute engine burn slowed the spacecraft sufficiently for it to be captured by mercury’s gravity. by design, the messenger loops around the planet on a highly elliptical

astronomical events have been making headlines lately. on april 8, the orbits of mars, earth, and the sun fell into a straight line in a rare cosmic alignment called an opposition. precisely one week later, we will see the first of four extremely unusual total lunar eclipses. is there any significance to these extraordinary celestial events? could it be that god is using the sun, moon, and stars to communicate with us and to announce things to come? the answer is yes! the bible is clear that the sun, moon, and stars are connected to israel and biblical prophecy. throughout history god has used the science of astronomy (never astrology!) in connection with historical events to write prophetic messages in the heavens. one significant way god reveals coming events is through a phenomenon that scientists call ""blood moons."" these are total lunar eclipses in which the moon appears to be blood red. the coming message from god is so urgent that he is going to sovereignly arrange the sun and the moon to perfectly align themselves to create not just one blood moon, but a tetrad-a series of four consecutive blood moons! nasa has projected that the next tetrad will begin on april 15, 2014 and end on september 28, 2015. it will occur in the following sequence: 1. passover-april 15, 2014 2. feast of tabernacles-october 8, 2014 3. passover-april

Article 8 - gorgeous glimpses of calamity
in 1961, yuri a. gagarin, the first man to orbit the earth, issued his initial impressions from an altitude of more than 100 miles. the sky was deep black, he said, and the earth’s horizon crowned with “a beautiful blue halo.” between bright white clouds, he enthused, he could make out “snow, forest, mountains.” it was an edenic picture. in the subsequent depths of the cold war, with nuclear weapons racing off the assembly lines of the soviet union and the united states, succeeding cosmonauts and astronauts contributed their own observations. like mr. gagarin, they found their world mesmerizingly beautiful. they also reported a singularly intriguing fact: no borders or political boundaries could be seen from space. in fact, few signs of humanity were visible, at least on the sunlit side. sure, los angeles was visibly smoggy. and irrigated cropland could sometimes be discerned, like pointillism on nile delta sand. but these were exceptions. under a startlingly thin layer of atmosphere, vast expanses of desert ceded to forests that gave way to the oceans that make up 70 percent of earth’s surface. the planet seemed largely untouched. only at night, when jewel-like cities rotated into view, did clear signs of civilization emerge. there was something profoundly reassuring about this. even as the icbms slept, it was heartening to know that despite

Article 1 - rafael cruz blames carly fiorina for son ted cruz’s “failure to become president”
dallas, tx – speaking recently at the texas gop’s convention, carly fiorina announced, “i am endorsing – for senate, in 2018, ted cruz.” the texas native-turned-californian tech executive, who cruz tapped as his unofficial running mate after she was vanquished from the presidential race and before he followed suit, was joined by rafael cruz, the texas senator’s preacher father, in not endorsing trump at the freedom, faith & fellowship rally at the state party’s biennial convention in dallas. however, when cruz senior took the mic, he turned his crosshairs towards fiorina and unexpectedly started blasting away. “it is said that the true measure of a man is not in him being a victor, but rather in his ability to withstand defeat and come back even stronger. i can say that i am proud of my son ted no matter what, and you better believe he is coming back guns blazing,” rafael cruz started off, followed by applause and whistles of approval. “however,” he continued, “i can’t say that i am proud of every single choice he has made in the past weeks and months. he has made mistakes, we all have, but the biggest one by far is opting to allow this woman, a failed executive of a once great company, a backdoor shot at her own, selfish goals. he has thus caused his own demise and has deprived himself of what is likely a once

Article 2 - my endorsement for president
my endorsement for president (before it's news) this is one of the most difficult posts i have ever had to write. i had naively hoped that this election cycle, i would be treated to a substantive contest between a spate of highly accomplished two-term conservative governors, and senators of great rhetorical skill acting as the ideological conscience of the bunch. as the primary wore on through the summer of 2015, it became clear that the gop electorate was not interested in governors of accomplishment, but i still had hope for a final contest between two of my favorite senators: ted cruz and marco rubio. i hoped to hear a rousing and fair debate between the two leading into super tuesday, where i would be able to make a decision based on who would be the better president, and who would make the better general election opponent against hillary clinton. sadly, 35% of our party has decided to abdicate their responsibility as adults to take their civic voting duty seriously, and so the poisonous threat of trump has completely altered my own personal voting calculus. no one can be a good president unless they can win a presidential election. that means that the ability to beat hillary clinton is a necessary pre-requisite to the job. it also unfortunately means that the ability to beat donald trump is a necessary pre-requisite to the job. i’ve been on the record for months saying that ted cruz would be a better president than marco rubio. i still

Article 3 - senator cruz’s message makes a lot of sense
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! (my new american thinker post) like many others, senator cruz is in iowa to “test the waters,” as they like to say. frankly, i don’t care much about the politics of 2016. it’s too early anyway. i am listening to what these candidates are saying. senator cruz’ message is upbeat, pro-american, pro-freedom and one that hispanics should be taking note of: “in his 26-minute speech at the family leadership summit, the 42-year-old senator presented himself as a zesty outsider. he called on grassroots activists to help him and a small band of like-minded lawmakers pressure congress to defund obamacare, drawing ovations for that , for his call to abolish the irs, and for his refusal to accept a path to citizenship in any immigration overhaul.” ( dallas morning news ) senator cruz is talking to hispanics like americans not an ethnic group. i really like that. identity politics makes me sick! he delivers a message of opportunity and growth, or precisely the two things that the hispanic community needs more of. on the other hand, democrats speak to hispanics like victims. they also oversell what government can and will do. on education, senator cruz is calling for more choice and options. democrats are just calling for more of the same, or “no reforms” and forcing teachers to contribute to the

Article 4 - ted cruz pledges to secure u.s. border with land mines
lynchburg, va. – republican senator ted cruz announced his bid for the white house today in a speech delivered during a student convocation at liberty university, the largest christian university in the world, located in lynchburg, virginia. senator cruz spoke before a packed auditorium, saying he wants to “reignite the promise of america.” following the first of many standing ovations, mr. cruz, who is a vocal opponent of obama’s immigration policies, told the evangelical audience that if he is elected president he will “rebuild american immigration policy from the ground up.” to start, the senator said he will immediately halt obama’s proposed plan to grant amnesty to the roughly 20 million undocumented aliens currently residing in the united states. back in 2012 senator cruz said he would support deploying american troops along the u.s.-mexican border, but today he laid out a new plan for border security, one that he says will “significantly reduce the cost to american taxpayers.” the first phase of the senator’s immigration strategy, following the liquidation of the amnesty program, is to mine the 1,989 mile long border between the u.s. and mexico. “we’ve got over eleven million land mines sitting in storage, paid for by taxpayers like yourselves,” cruz told the audience, adding, “it’s time we put them to use.” in 1997 the united states signed the convention on the prohibition and use, stockpiling, production, and

Article 8 - rubio and cruz trade conservative principles for compromising politics
rubio and cruz trade conservative principles for compromising politics (before it's news) during the republican primaries, senators marco rubio (r-fl) and ted cruz (r-tx) were the last two so-called “conservatives” to fall to donald trump. for many, they represented the hope of having a true conservative in the white house. but now, in the aftermath of election 2016, it appears these two are just the latest examples of washington-establishment politicians willing to compromise their principles for politics. no wonder they’re both enshrined in the gutless on principles (gop) hall of shame. first, there’s rubio. although support for one of the original members of the gang of eight was tepid at first, rubio appeared to have learned his lesson after wrongly supporting amnesty for illegal aliens. even after he suspended his presidential campaign and began preparations for his senatorial re-election campaign–a job he claimed he no longer wanted because he “hated” it–cruz convinced conservatives that rubio had rediscovered his conservative heart. unfortunately, his just-announced decision to support rex tillerson for secretary of state–after indicating that he wouldn’t–proves that rubio’s new conservative demeanor was just an election year act. (emphasis mine) mr. tillerson is likely to have a potentially unprecedented level of influence over the direction of our foreign policy. i remain concerned that in the years to come, our country will not give

Article 2 - jeb bush, 20 years after conversion, is guided by his catholic faith
“as a public leader, one’s faith should guide you,” mr. bush said in italy in 2009, explaining his attitude about the relationship between religion and politics at a conference associated with communion and liberation, a conservative catholic lay movement. “in the united states, many people think you need to keep your faith, put it in a security box, if you’re an elected official — put it in a safety deposit box until you finish your service as a public servant and then you can go get it back,” he added. “i never felt that was appropriate.” like his brother george w. bush, who established the white house office on faith-based initiatives, jeb bush was a champion of religion-based social services. as governor, he established what he said was the nation’s first faith-based prison, encouraging religious activity — of any faith tradition — in an effort to reduce criminal behavior. and he has said his religious beliefs helped inform his concern about child welfare and other issues. “you hear people say, ‘i don’t want to impose my faith,’ ” mr. bush told the newspaper the florida catholic days after leaving office in 2007. “well, it’s not an imposition of faith. it’s who you are.” the son and brother of protestant presidents, mr. bush, if elected, would be the nation’s second catholic president. sometimes, he carries a rosary in his pocket and fingers its beads at moments of crisis. he is a member

Article 4 - philip yancey dumbfounded evangelicals support trump, 'who stands against everything that christianity believes'
(photo: twitter/jerry falwell jr) best-selling christian author philip yancey stated that he cannot understand how so many evangelical christians can support republican nominee donald trump. in an interview with the europe-based publication evangelical focus published last friday, yancey said he was ""staggered"" by the support evangelical voters are giving trump. ""i am staggered that so many conservative or evangelical christians would see a man who is a bully, who made his money by casinos, who has had several wives and several affairs … that they would somehow paint him as a hero, as someone that we could stand behind,"" explained yancey. ""i can understand why maybe you choose these policies that you support, but to choose a person who stands against everything that christianity believes as the hero, the representative, one that we get behind enthusiastically is not something that i understand at all.""

internet privacy – do we really want it? % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! as the battle for internet privacy rolls on in washington, privacy advocates are condemning the vote to repeal internet privacy protections approved by the federal communications commission in the final days of the obama administration. the rules would have required internet service providers to get your permission before collecting and sharing your data and to notify customers about the types of information they collected and shared. internet service providers have a lot of data about on your web browsing history, app usage and geo-location. we give them that data for convenience. we allow them to have it so we can quicker find what we want when we shop, so we can be informed about great deals we might appreciate when shopping. we check in on social media, leave reviews of restaurants, car services, hair salons, and hotels. we look to the internet for recommendations about where to shop, what car to get, for best deals on plane tickets, vacation spots, boutique stores, fashion advice, and school research. we put an enormous amount of information about ourselves out there for people to see. facebook has become a definitive record of people’s lives. from birthdays to wedding anniversaries to pregnancies, religion, health issues, and family tragedies – it’s all out there for the world to see. i rely on facebook to remind me of birthdays and anniversaries. we schedule

Article 2 - problems with reality tv
problems with reality tv (before it's news) some of the problems with reality tv range from ethics to the actual people on the show. when reality tv first hit the big time with mtv’s real world, things were calm since no one knew what to expect. now with the deluge of reality tv shows on television right now, it was only a matter of time before bad writing, contestant exploitation, and blatant rip-offs were to inhabit the industry, and there are a lot of shows falling into the abovementioned categories. scripts are used in reality shows. it’s just a matter-of-fact now. situations are manufactured and specific lines are given to the reality show participants so that drama can unfold. most reality tv shows have specific themes and challenges that are meant to pit the contestants or participants together so they fight, argue, and cause mayhem. many people watch reality tv to satisfy the desire to laugh at those people who have problems. viewers mock, criticize, ridicule, and judge those who can’t get along with others, like to make fools of themselves, and do stupid things just to make a buck. one major problem with reality tv is the perpetuation of problems with america. the themes are enhanced when watching reality tv. racisim, homophobia, gender hatred, etc. are all obvious with some reality tv shows and subtle in others. the fact that the producers let this happen reinforces the bad elements of people which were once hidden from public view. give us anything

Article 3 - tv shows that need to go
with the wga strike over, tv can now return to its former glory! (no it won’t – expect most programs to either stay off the air indefinitely or return in a truncated form around april.) keep on trucking, keep on sucking: pointless, mind-numbing reality shows are still the only sure thing on television today, barring the billions of big-production game shows that have contestants involved in amazing feats of strength and brain power, from being smarter than a 5th grader to lying about really loving your wife – all in the name of entertainment! sigh… ok, seriously – we really need to pull the plug on most of this garbage. does quality control even exist anymore, or did everybody just stop caring? our standards are shot, people! the following shows are not just terrible – they’re f*cking greek tragedies. american gladiators now look, i have fond memories of titan, malibu, boner xiv, foosball and maxwell house just like any human born with a personality, but let’s not pussyfoot around the fact that this “revision” of an 80’s cult favorite is nothing more than an overproduced turd. sure, the eliminator is technically better this time around, but who cares when one-thousand wonky cameras are on every f*cking angle, making me nauseous, while the armageddon-inspired soundtrack is supposed to “move me” or something. i could give a flying medicine

Article 4 - tv roulette: claymore, e1
tv roulette: claymore, e1 (before it's news) as some of you may know, i’m currently running a patreon to support my blogging here, and one of the reward levels involves me introducing a tv roulette feature here. here’s how it works for those who backed me at that tier: once a month, you get to pick the show, and i’ll either watch the first episode (if i haven’t seen it before) or an episode of your choosing (if i have) and write about it in my best flamboyant, ranty, squee-filled style. reality tv by negotiation only, because it erodes my soul; otherwise, anything goes. if i like the show, i’ll keep it up for the next month; if i don’t, you can pick something else next time around. right now, i’ve got two tv roulette backers – the first of whom, margie, picked claymore for me to watch. so: let the inaugural tv roulette blog begin! claymore: episode 1 first impressions: this is probably not a show i should be watching with a toddler peering excitedly over my shoulder. and yet. also, why the swordmaster wearing sensible heels? practical combat footwear is practical. no, but seriously: god, i love anime (except when i don’t, but that’s another story). it’s a medium that has exactly zero fucks to give about explaining shit in the first episode, you know?

Article 5 - ‘everything is allowed. fighting, alcohol, murder, rape, smoking, anything.’
‘everything is allowed. fighting, alcohol, murder, rape, smoking, anything.’ % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! these are the rules to new tv reality show, an ultimate 9-month siberian survival test stranded in remote taiga with bears and wolves in minus 40c winter. the online project screened 24/7 around the world will see 30 male and female contestants seek to stay alive in wilderness populated with bears and wolves. organisers boast ‘everything is allowed’ including ‘rape’ and ‘murder’, but would-be participants are nevertheless warned: ‘you must understand that the police will come and take you away. we are on the territory of russia, and obey the laws of the russian federation.’ contestants will be permitted knives, but no guns. they will be given survival training from russia’s elite former gru spetznaz operatives, but after that they will be on their own coping with temperatures ranging from 35c in high summer to minus 40c or lower in the depths of the siberian winter. the contest called ‘game2: winter’ is the brainchild of novosibirsk entrepreneur yevgeny pyatkovsky, who said: ‘we will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped. ‘we will have nothing to do with this. this will be spelt out

Article 6 - we are the real movement to destroy fake news
we are the real movement to destroy fake news % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) we are the real movement to destroy fake news by jon rappoport the new mandate is: throw off the tattered tasseled layers of horseshit. the bottom line: we are the real movement. we’re the people who have the job of exposing big-time mainstream news as the frauds they are. along the way, we’ve encountered some strange ghouls and goblins. just to sketch in a few recent editions: scott pelley (cbs) is careful to watch himself. his tendency is to shove the message down the viewer’s throat like a pro surgeon making an incision without bothering to administer an anesthetic. pelley’s been working to correct that. he’s a high-iq android who’s training himself to be human. it’s not going well. diane (formerly of abc) “don’t cry for me, america” sawyer wandered into sloppiness. she poured syrup on her words, as if she’d had a few cocktails before breakfast. she affected a pose of “caring too much” and “refusing to apologize for it”—“i’m suffering for humanity and i won’t cover it up.” sniff, sniff. before being put out to dry for lying about being shot at in iraq, brian williams (nbc) was head and shoulders above his

Article 7 - three little words
three little words (before it's news) a few days ago, i was reading chris skinner’s then-latest post on the financial services club’s blog, headlined never mind the channels, here’s the b&**&^ks. and agreeing, of course. we are connected not channelled, as i wrote in the kernel for this blog seven years ago. and yet, as chris says, there are still many who try and recreate the segments and channels and isolations of the past, as if nothing has changed. yet so much has changed, and changed irrevocably. i thought i’d try and summarise the changes in a small number of word dichotomies, just to see how they would play out. depending on the comments i receive, i can always extend the list and, where required, expand on the explanations. so here are the first three: and not or channel-like choices are about mutual exclusion. you can choose bbc or itv. an mp3 file or a cd. a digital download or a dvd. a “pirate” copy or a “legal” copy. mobile or fixed. wireless or cellular. a or b. one or the other. sometimes the choices are binary, sometimes there are a series of choices. but one way or the other, the product and hierarchy mindset tends to think about mutual exclusion. customers don’t think that way. why would they? mutual exclusion constrains their ability to derive value

Article 1 - a nose job just scratches the surface
grown-ups have been known to harbor such fantasies as well. abc bought the rights to produce a version of the british hit ''wife swap,'' in which families exchange mothers for two weeks. a low-income mother with many children, for example, switches households with a high-powered career woman. the next big thing in reality programming seems to be shows that empower ordinary people not to be the best they can be, but to become someone else entirely. examples abound of clever chameleons who slip the bonds of class and profession, most recently in ''catch me as you can,'' in which leonardo dicaprio recreated a role played by tony curtis in ''the great impostor,'' switching from doctor to airline pilot to lawyer. most changelings require outside tutelage, however, and so the subjects of ''faking it'' are assigned their own henry higginses to help them make the transition. on a recent ''faking it,'' on bbc america, kasper, a london dancer and ballet instructor, is coached by two bald and heavily tattooed professional wrestlers in the fine points of their art. after one long day practicing backward throws, kasper sits slumped on the floor, his pale chest dotted with small brown bruises, and says quietly to the camera, ''i don't think the aggression is coming very naturally to me.'' newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter

Article 2 - new jersey beckons housewives’ next series
the series began during the economic boom, in 2006, with “the real housewives of orange county.” the recipe for the show drew from other hits focusing on nouveau-riche characters: “desperate housewives,” fox’s teenage drama “the oc” and mtv’s reality series “laguna beach.” the series has been a moneymaker for bravo: in 2008 the shows pulled in about $22 million in advertising for the network, according to the research company tns media intelligence. “given the last 10 years and how much wealth was created, and how many people became upper-middle-class, a lot of us are looking for signs on how to behave: what’s acceptable behavior; if you have wealth, how should you behave,” said michael hirschorn, a partner in ish entertainment, which produces television shows, and former executive vice president for original programming at vh1. “the ‘real housewives’ series are really smart about class and taste, and people, especially women, are fascinated by that.” after three seasons in orange county, bravo introduced “the real housewives of new york city” in 2008, followed by “the real housewives of atlanta.” atlanta focused on black women, largely athletes’ wives; many of the new york women held jobs and traded stinging commentary. new jersey has its own accent: two of the five women are sisters, and a third is their sister-in-law.

Article 3 - tv's languishing laughometer
jeez, would it kill us to laugh more? have we, the audience for television comedy, become an inveterately tough crowd, perpetually annoyed grumps who take one skeptical look at focus-grouped new sitcoms that employ empirically adorable comedians and award-winning writers from ''letterman'' and ''the simpsons,'' and still won't for the world crack one paltry half-smile? let's hope not. and even if the sitcom is dead (and when will we know?), comedy on television doesn't have to die with it. or such is the strident hypothesis of not just comedy geeks who long for lenny bruce or ''your show of shows,'' but of troublemaking channels like mtv and comedy central: that audiences can still be induced to laugh, as they have been since the beginning of time, even if nowadays it takes more than afghan-strewn couches and precocious children and laugh tracks to do it. hmm. as can-do and reasonable as the hypothesis sounds (and as clearly as ''chappelle's show''-- how we miss you -- proves it can be done), i'm not sure it's right. alternative comedies -- a manic, almost desperate medley of reality, stand-up and sketch -- have had fast-and-furious premieres this summer. they're curious, they're inventive and they're not boring, but try as they might, they just don't yield simple, genuine laughs. hoping to have

Article 4 - being careful out there? hardly
the genesis after 12 years of toiling at universal television, where he worked on shows like “mcmillan & wife,” mr. bochco wanted out from the grind and the internal politics. a friend urged him to go to mtm enterprises, a powerhouse in half-hour comedies that wanted to expand into hourlong dramas. at mtm, its co-founder grant tinker told him to create shows he wanted to do. photo steven bochco (co-creator and executive producer) we didn’t know what we were doing. i mean, we certainly never set out to make a show that was going to be groundbreaking in any way. mike kozoll and i basically set out just to do something that we hadn’t done before, because we were kind of bored with the genre. in fact, when fred silverman [then the chief executive of nbc] asked us to do a pilot, we pitched him other things, and he said, “no. i want a cop show.” warren littlefield (nbc executive at the time) i was the new kid on the comedy development team, and “hill street” was developed out of the comedy department. fred basically said in a development meeting, “hey, why don’t we do a one-hour ‘barney miller’?” bochco he had just seen “fort apache, the bronx,” and he said, “i’m attracted to that, because that’s a show about

Article 5 - are you hot? not if you're a sitcom writer
''nobody listened,'' she remembered. ''they were buzzing. it could have been the best sitcom ever, and we were doomed.'' this year, ms. lipp is pitching to cable. ''a grim reaper looms over the business right now,'' said bill martin, a veteran of ''third rock from the sun'' and ''in living color'' and currently executive producer of ''grounded for life,'' a family comedy on wb. the number of new comedies on the networks has sunk steadily in recent years, from 62 in 1997 to 35 this season, according to the center for the study of popular television at syracuse university. networks are furiously signing up shows like ''are you hot? the search for america's sexiest people.'' and some comedy writers are turning into straight men and doing the unthinkable: signing up for reality. ''we've kind of dumbed down, not by intention -- the system demands it,'' said bill diamond, an executive producer with ''murphy brown'' in the mid-1990's. first came the popularity of hourlong dramas. then came network belt-tightening, which dried up development deals, cutting into writing staffs and salaries. and now the tidal wave of reality television has come. mr. diamond, who has worked in development since 1997, said the huge ratings for reality shows demonstrated the viewing public's boredom with ''cookie cutter'' and ''setup punch line'' laugh-track-type comedies that have

Article 6 - australian whose line is it anyway? suffers from dated jokes and too much ocker
o n sunday night australia premiered its very own version of whose line is it anyway? – perhaps in response to the blood debt incurred by the us with its vicious murder of our own comedy export, thank god you’re here. let’s call it even. too many have suffered. the us can’t claim complete ownership of the improvisational sketch show, though; they merely liberated it from their one-time oppressors: the english. all iterations bearing the wliia acronym follow the same template: a host submits four fast-thinking improvisers to a series of games in which the guests are expected to joke, sing, rap, impersonate and, most importantly, mug in pursuit of laughs – and nothing else. it’s “the show where everything is made up and the points don’t matter” and it can be liberating to watch comedians work tirelessly to simply fire up viewers’ pleasure centres with short bursts of primal, instinctive comedy. whose line is it anyway? what to expect from the australian iteration read more when they can pull it off, that is. the uk version – itself a spin-off from a radio show – debuted in 1988, and its first season starred stephen fry, peter cook and the fried sparrow himself, jonathan pryce. esteemed pedigree aside, the players took part in the same goofy theatresports as their aussie counterparts do today: film dub, where the actors are at the whim of those doing the speaking off stage; party quir

Title: losing touch with reality
Content: ''the littlest groom,'' fox's new show in which the audience is invited to gawk as a 4-foot-5 man searches for a bride, may mark an exploitative new low in television programming. it may also be the tip-off that reality television has ''jumped the shark,'' tv-aficionado lingo for the point at which programming makes a final leap into witlessness and heads irredeemably into reruns. it is hard to become too nostalgic for the golden days of reality tv, since the genre has always been a slightly sour cocktail of exploitation, voyeurism and humiliation. but looking back, it now seems as if there was a kind of innocence to the first ''survivor'' group to do darwinian battle on a deserted south china sea island, or the first ''fear factor'' contestants to munch live bugs on national television. reality television, however, demands novelty. so the networks, eyes fixed firmly on the nielsen ratings, became eager carny barkers, beckoning audiences to increasingly lurid variations on the theme. the deserted island became ''temptation island,'' where attractive singles tried to break up ''committed couples.'' on ''fear factor,'' bug eating gave way, in a recent episode, to men diving into dumpsters and pulling out pig uteruses and cow stomachs for their girlfriends to eat. american networks are not alone in this race to the bottom. last year, british television broadcast ''celebrity detox camp,'' which featured famous people getting enemas. ''jumping the shark,'' as the web site www.jumptheshark.com explains, refers to a ''happy days'' episode in which fonzie was on water skis and tried to jump over a shark, a stunt widely viewed as the beginning of the end for the series. reality tv is still well represented in the nielsens, but given its current state, it's hard to imagine that will last for long. of course, just as reality television succeeded the craze inspired by ''who wants to be a millionaire,'' there is undoubtedly a new genre waiting in the wings. we're sure whatever it is will make for compelling viewing.

Meanwhile, Elstat Chief Andreas Georgiou faces felony charges over allegedly manipulating Greece's 2009 deficit to push the country into the IMF bailout mechanism. The investigation also targets other officials for ""artificially"" revising the debt from 12% to 15.4%.

The Greek bailout has been seen as a means to preserve the ""United States of Europe"" dream, with many arguing that it's primarily about preventing foreign bank bankruptcies rather than bailing out Greece itself.

In other news, Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson resigned after falsely claiming on his resume to have earned a degree in computer science. JPMorgan Chase's Chief Investment Officer, Ina Drew, is reportedly stepping down following the financial giant's $2-billion trading loss.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has signaled its readiness to buy massive quantities of Italian and Spanish debt to put a firewall around the European debt crisis. However, concerns remain about the ECB's true intentions and whether it will follow through with big bond purchases.

Greek voters rejected the latest bailout package by ""the troika"" of major financial institutions, leading some to speculate that this could lead to the disclosure of a secret European space program. The current policy of the European Central Bank is seen as the reverse of mainstream fiscal policy, where governments spend money to stimulate the economy during periods of recession or low economic growth.

In Spain, peaceful protests turned violent after police shot and beat protesters and journalists. The Greek government has been forced to step down, with Prime Minister George Papandreou announcing a new government will be formed.","Greece is facing a severe economic crisis, with the country's debt reaching €130 billion. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to provide a bailout package, but negotiations have been stalled due to disagreements over debt relief and austerity measures.

The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, has rejected the IMF's demands for deep cuts in public spending and pension reductions. In response, the IMF has lowered its rating on Greece's debt from B- to CCC, indicating a high risk of default.

The European Union (EU) is also under pressure to intervene, with the EU's finance ministers meeting to discuss a potential bailout package. The EU has agreed to provide €13.5 billion in aid to Greece, but the terms of the package are still being negotiated.

Greece's economic crisis has sparked concerns about contagion, with other European countries facing similar challenges. The country's rating agencies have downgraded its debt, making it harder for Greece to access international markets.

The Greek government is under pressure to implement austerity measures, including pension cuts and tax increases. However, the opposition party Syriza has rejected the bailout package, calling for a more radical approach to addressing the crisis.

In a bid to address the crisis, the Greek government has launched an investigation into wealthy individuals who have evaded taxes. The government is also seeking to recover €30 billion in uncollected taxes.

The situation remains volatile, with Greece facing a deadline of June 17 to come up with €1.2 billion in cash to pay public-sector workers' salaries. The IMF has agreed to provide the funds, but only if Greece agrees to implement austerity measures and reduce its debt by 20%.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

elstat chief to face felony charges over inflated greek deficit in 2009 % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) greek economic prosecutors are seeking felony charges against the former president of the greek statistics authority andreas georgiou over upwards manipulation of the greek deficit in 2009 and thus with the aim to push the country into the imf bailout mechanism. apart from georgiou felony charges are also to be raised against the head of directorate for national accounts, and the head of special department of statistics research. the three are facing felony charges on the ground that they “artificially” revised the debt from 12% to 15.4% in 2009, so that stricter measures of fiscal adjustments should be imposed. georgiou and co. are to face also misdemeanor offenses for ‘repeatdely dereliction of duty’ and ‘making false statements’. at the same time, the prosecutors seek to identify the instigators of the deficit ‘cooking’ as well as the possible involvement of other people. because of the importance of the case, the case is to be investigated by the judge responsible for corruption cases. the scandal of deficti revision broke in september 2011, when ex elstat board member zoi georganta, professor for econometrics at the university of macedonia, spoke to several greek media and claimed that greece’s budget deficit underwent a upward

(before it's news) underlying much of what we see and don’t see regarding the modern-day tragedy that is greece, is all about preserving the dream of a pan european nation state, a united states of europe if you will. only secondarily is it about the solvency of the greek nation and about bailing out the foreign bank holders of greek sovereign debt. let me explain my perspective. words: 627 so said arnold bock (www.financialarticlesummariestoday.com) in an email to lorimer wilson, editor of www.munknee.com (your key to making money!), which can be found below in its entirety.

Article 5 - fed watch: the unpleasantness continues
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! tim duy: the unpleasantness continues, by tim duy: lots of moving pieces tonight as financial centers around the world prepare for the impact of the s&p downgrade of us debt and the ongoing eurozone debt crisis. the list: ecb finally ready to come to the table. the ecb is signaling they are prepared to buy up massive quantities of italian and spanish debt, hoping to put a firewall around the european debt crisis. of course, this isn’t the first firewall european leaders have set, to no avail. perhaps this time will be different. paul krugman argues, i think correctly, that at least for italy the issue is seemingly a liquidity crisis, not an insolvency crisis. the ecb could effectively act as a lender of last resort in such a case, and bring about stability with only minor fiscal adjustment. my concern is that if this was just a liquidity crisis, then why did the ecb posture that significant fiscal adjustments were necessary? just to look tough? as to whether or not the ecb is actually prepared to follow through with big bond purchases, i refer you to yves smith: my readers of european press tell me that the signals this weekend was that the ecb wants to nibble only and is trying to prevent panic sales. if this reading is correct, this is a variant on the paulson “bazooka” strategy of july 2008 with f

Article 7 - greek no to austerity may lead to disclosure of secret european space program
greek no to austerity may lead to disclosure of secret european space program (before it's news) sunday’s vote in greece was a simple question about whether or not voters would accept the latest bailout package by “the troika” of major financial institutions: the international monetary fund, the european central bank and the european commission. by voting ‘no’, the greek people said that they rejected the troika’s core demand that staying within the european union’s fiscal system meant adhering to its strict limits on government spending in relation to national debt levels. maintaining these strict fiscal limits, the general public was told, enables inflation to stay low and preserves the value of the currency, which for europe is the euro. in reality, minimizing government public spending to preserve the euro’s value, enables more funds to be siphoned off by the european central bank and other national central banks into a highly classified black budget for a multinational secret space program where european nations play a prominent role. the current policy of the european central bank is the reverse of mainstream fiscal policy. in periods of recession or low economic growth, the idea is that governments spend money to stimulate the economy. governments usually do this by issuing treasury bonds that private entities, central banks or other governments buy. these government treasury bonds become a debt to be repaid at a future time. greek governments have been doing this for decades to maintain welfare policies, and overall government debt has reached an unsustainable level of nearly 180% of the gross domestic

Article 1 - i.m.f. agrees with athens that greece needs debt relief
while the i.m.f. would be only one of the parties negotiating on behalf of creditors, the eurozone lenders have made it clear that they value the organization’s expertise and counsel — even though they are not obliged to follow its recommendations. the greek finance minister, yanis varoufakis, said on thursday that he would step down immediately if greeks voted yes. mr. varoufakis, who even before the leftist government was elected had argued that much of greece’s mountain of debt needed to be forgiven, has been a key player in the months of talks that have led to the current impasse. video the i.m.f. appeared to have little remaining patience with the greek government, which this week became the first developed nation to effectively default on a loan from the fund. but patience has also run out among the other eurozone countries, whose taxpayers have lent greece more than €130 billion. on thursday, the head of the eurozone’s group of finance ministers, jeroen dijsselbloem, suggested greeks would need to vote yes on sunday for any future bailout talks to make headway. “the greek government is rejecting everything with the suggestion that if you vote no you will get a better or less tough, or more friendly, package,” mr. dijsselbloem said. “that suggestion is simply wrong.” if greeks were to vote yes, though, it would signal their desire to accept

Article 2 - greece’s stumble follows a headlong rush into the euro
a stern-faced theodor waigel, germany’s finance minister at the time, weighed in. latin characters only, he insisted. besides, as mr. papantoniou recalls the argument by mr. waigel, poor small greece was in no position to make demands. “he said to me, ‘what makes you think you will ever be in the euro?’” mr. papantoniou, a socialist who shepherded greece’s entry into the euro, had the last word. “i fought hard, and placed a bet with him then and there — and i won.” now, as greece’s european union partners prepare to bail out the debt-ridden country — the first time the 16-nation euro zone has been forced to rescue one of its members — many critics, inside and outside of the country, are wishing that mr. papantoniou had lost his bet. concerns are growing that contagion could spread to other countries on europe’s southern tier and even infect the continent’s banking system. by some accounts, europe’s current plight can be traced to 1981, when greece, still emerging from the aftermath of a military dictatorship, rushed to join the european community — 14 years ahead of the much richer austria, finland and sweden and even five years before spain and portugal. at the time, president francois mitterrand of france opposed the bloc’s southward expansion, fearing that countries like greece

Article 3 - temporary cabinet named in greece as agency lowers nation&#8217;s debt rating
photo athens — political and economic tremors rolled out of greece and across europe again on thursday as the caretaker prime minister, panagiotis pikrammenos, appointed a temporary cabinet to manage the country’s affairs until june 17, when the second general election in a little more than a month is held. an increasingly urgent question is whether europe can afford to wait until that election, which is expected to determine the future of the troubled country in the euro zone and the broader stability of the bloc. events may force european officials’ hand much earlier. on thursday, the rating agency fitch lowered its rating on greek debt from b- to a lowly ccc, saying in a statement that the downgrade “reflects the heightened risk that greece may not be able to sustain its membership of economic and monetary union” after the strong showing of anti-austerity parties in the may 6 elections. indeed, the leader of one of those parties, the coalition of the radical left, or syriza, which placed second in the elections and is now leading in opinion polls, repeated his opposition to the bailout deal, known as the memorandum, in an interview with state television on wednesday night. advertisement continue reading the main story “there is no memorandum,” the syriza leader, alexis tsipras, 37, told the state channel net. “the memorandum is finished politically because it has not produced results,” he said, referring to a

Article 4 - leftist leader in greece rules out coalition with major parties
although mr. tsipras has gone furthest in rejecting the bailout terms, both mr. venizelos and mr. samaras have called for modifications, especially to the time frame in which greece is expected to meet deficit-reduction targets. photo still, if greece fails to enforce the benchmark cuts and structural changes set in a second loan agreement reached in february, its lenders will withhold the next installment of aid it expects in may. without that, it cannot pay a bond that comes due on may 17 or meet expenses past july. “greece must know that there is no alternative to agreed reforms if it wants to stay in the euro zone,” jörg asmussen, a member of the executive board of the european central bank, said tuesday. but as sunday’s elections made clear, greek voters have grown weary of such statements, which many believe are empty threats, and flocked to syriza, which received nearly 17 percent of the vote by trying to carve out a space that is opposed to the loan agreement but in favor of greece’s staying with the euro . syriza came in second to new democracy’s 19 percent and ahead of the socialists’ 13 percent, both parties’ worst showing since their founding in 1974. mr. tsipras has said that he will seek to form a leftist-led government based on five points: the abolition of the debt deal with foreign creditors and all related laws that have

Article 5 - greece seeks taxes from wealthy with cash havens in london
at the request of the athens government, the british financial authorities recently handed over a detailed list of about 400 greek individuals who have bought and sold london properties since 2009. the list, closely guarded, has not been publicly disclosed. but greek officials are examining it to determine whether the people named — who they say include prominent businessmen, bankers, shipping tycoons and professional athletes — have deceived the tax authorities by understating their wealth. “these people have money and they are known — but it is not clear yet if they have violated any laws,” said haris theoharis, an official in the greek finance ministry. tax investigators have been examining the list to see whether there is any overlap between those who bought london properties and those already identified as being tax cheats. the greek government, under pressure from its international lenders to raise 13.5 billion euros ($17.4 billion) through tax increases and spending cuts, is intent on making the well-heeled share the burden. studies have shown that the country may be forgoing as much as 30 billion euros a year in uncollected taxes, with a significant portion of that amount having been shipped out of the country as the affluent seek shelter from greece’s financial storm. this week, the government of prime minister antonis samaras opened an investigation into the bank accounts of more than 30 greek politicians to determine whether they should be charged with tax evasion and the illegal accumulation of wealth. the

Article 6 - fears of greek default rise as weekend talks on debt payment break down
late sunday evening, however, negotiators called an end to two days of discussions, as greek officials angrily claimed that the technocrats with whom they were holding discussions had no authority to negotiate any sort of deal. photo “they wanted us to hit our targets by slashing pensions and increasing taxes,” said one senior member of the greek negotiating team who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. “but they had no mandate to negotiate.” two senior members of the greek government, nikos pappas, a close confidant of prime minister alexis tsipras, and yannis dragasakis, the deputy prime minister, traveled to brussels for the talks. they met with senior-level european officials, none of whom had the same rank in their respective government posts. “despite the presence of the greek delegation in brussels, there was no response from the institutions for discussions to be held at the necessary level and with the required authorization that would allow a solution to issues that remain open,” mr. dragasakis said in a statement. the pressure on greece to reach an agreement is escalating. by the end of this month, it must come up with €1.2 billion in cash to make pension and salary payments to public-sector workers, according to senior finance officials in athens. with the central government’s coffers extremely bare, mr. tsipras’s government will be forced to raid state pension and municipal funds to make good on these

Article 7 - s.&p. downgrades portugal and greece again
mr. mcguire said that investors had been dumping short-dated portuguese debt this week to protect themselves from default, making it harder for lisbon to raise money by issuing short-dated bills and hence make it to june without a bailout. if fitch and moody’s investors service both downgrade portugal by one more notch, it will cost investors 5 percent more to use its debt as collateral in exchange for loans from the european central bank. meanwhile, investors are waiting for the results of a health check on irish banks, scheduled for release by the irish central bank on thursday, and an announcement from the european central bank about a new facility to support struggling banks that will be focused initially on irish lenders. in june, the results of stress tests on european banks, and steps to recapitalize them, will be announced. photo mr. mcguire said that countries like ireland, greece and portugal would either have to default or “pray that a surge in economic growth comes along to save them.” the euro was broadly steady, at $1.4088, from levels late monday. s.& p. said portugal was likely to have to turn to the european stability mechanism, which is being set up by european countries, for aid. unlike greece, portugal might be able to avoid restructuring its debt, but the agency said that the government’s unsecured debt, or debt issued without the security of an underlying asset, would

Article 8 - european finance ministers and i.m.f. reach deal on greek bailout terms
“greece has already come a very, very long way and tonight the eurogroup has rightly recognized that,” said olli rehn, the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, referring to the group of finance ministers who met here. but officials, including wolfgang schäuble, the german finance minister, said the payout would be made only once one part of the agreement — a debt buyback — had been completed. during the talks, which lasted about 12 hours, the i.m.f. pressed ministers to agree that greece’s debt should be cut by about 20 percent of g.d.p. through methods that include the debt buyback program at discounted prices, lowering interest rates, lengthening the deadlines for debt repayments, and returning profits to greece made on bonds bought by the european central bank. photo in exchange, the i.m.f. compromised by loosening its debt target to about 124 percent of greece’s gross domestic product by the end of the decade. the fund had been insisting on a target of 120 percent by 2020. christine lagarde, managing director of the i.m.f., emphasized at a news conference that agreement had also been reached to ensure greek debt was “substantially lower” than 110 percent of g.d.p. by 2022. “what remains to be done is a lot of nitty-gritty work, of course — national parliaments are going to have to consult with their respective

Title: greek prosecutor calls papandreou, papaconstantinou on 2009-revised deficit
Content: greek prosecutor calls papandreou, papaconstantinou on 2009-revised deficit (before it's news) a bombshell with a weight of at least one mega-tone was dropped in the picturesque city of athens on friday afternoon. thus while greek government officials have been dealing with the troika on the left and the private greek bond holders on the right. economic prosecutor grigoris peponis requested in a letter to prosecutor of supreme court that former prime minister george papandreou, former finance minister george papaconstantinou and other members of the economic team of the previous government would be checked on ‘any possible criminal liabilities” concerning the budget deficit of 2009 that was upwards revised by the greek statistics authority (elstat). peponis requested that the file would be submitted to the greek parliament. ﻿﻿﻿the economic prosecutor mentions the names of 18 people who have testified on the case and underlines that ”in the majority of testimonies, it has been explicitly referred to artificial swelling and arbitrary determination of the public deficit in 2009 at one hand, and possible responsibilities of the then prime minister, members of the then government and the then ministers of finance.” the move caused concerns at the supreme court because the president of the elstat had not be invited to testify by the prosecutor. the move caused surprise in the coalition government partner pasok because the last think papandreou-supporters would need now is an investigation against their party leader – even if he is thinking of resigning form the party leadership. the move caused no reaction in the public opinion becasue no greek is willing to believe that any greek politician would ever testify for anything or be held responsible. for further reading on revised budget deficit 2oo9 , new scandal with elstat? read more at keep talking greece source:

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the summary, and all claims made by the article are supported by the facts mentioned in the reliable news summary. The only minor discrepancy is that the reliable news summary mentions Tesla's battery factory plans, which are not explicitly stated in the original article but can be inferred from the context. Overall, the reliable news summary provides a clear and accurate representation of the article's content.","Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The automotive industry is shifting towards electrification. Toyota's green hybrids dominate the global market, saving more fuel and CO2 than all EVs combined (Article 1). The Chevrolet Volt builds upon GM's earlier electrification efforts, using technologies from the EV1, two-mode hybrid SUVs, and fuel cell vehicles (Article 2).

BMW is a leader in corporate social responsibility, ranking as the second most sustainable global vehicle manufacturer by Newsweek. They're pursuing ""electro-mobility"" and expanding into electric vehicles to reduce environmental impact (Article 3). However, the electrification of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles poses challenges for fleet owners, who may not see clear benefits or be willing to pay higher upfront costs (Article 4).

The automotive rechargeable battery market is growing rapidly, with a forecasted growth rate of 10.5% CAGR from 2015-2019 (Article 5). Environmentally friendly cars, such as hybrids, are becoming increasingly popular, reducing gasoline consumption and emissions (Article 6).

A survey of global car executives found that electric cars will not be affordable for 5 years, citing high battery costs and rare earth element shortages (Article 7). In contrast, the Obama administration's stimulus assessments have been criticized for being overly optimistic, ignoring challenges and economic realities in areas like renewable energy (Article 8).

Overall, the automotive industry is transitioning towards electrification, but challenges remain, including high upfront costs and environmental concerns.","Toyota is considering mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) with a range of over 300 km, contrary to its previous strategy of reserving EVs for short-distance commuting. The company aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020, according to reports by Nikkei.

This move would be a reversal of Toyota's current focus on plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs). The company has set up a team dedicated to developing electric cars with a range of over 300 km, which will be based on an existing vehicle platform such as the Prius or Corolla.

Other automakers, including Nissan and Volkswagen, have already promoted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future. Tesla is also planning to build its own battery factory, known as the Gigafactory, to produce enough lithium-ion batteries for about 500,000 cars annually by 2020.

California's zero-emission vehicle mandate will require automakers to derive 10% of their sales from highly efficient cars and some with no tailpipe emissions. The state has passed new regulations that will force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year.

2011 chevy volt builds on earlier gm electrification efforts % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the chevrolet volts now being delivered to enthusiastic retail customers would not have been possible without the lessons learned from previous general motors electrification efforts. many of the technologies resulting from the development of the ground-breaking ev1 in the 1990s, the two-mode hybrid suvs and pickup trucks and the fuel cell chevrolet equinox used for the project driveway program are part of the volt. “the band is back together – only this time there are fans,” said former ev1 chief engineer jon bereisa. regardless of whether a vehicle uses a hydrogen-powered fuel cell, a battery charged from the grid or just recovered kinetic energy from a hybrid drive system, the electric propulsion systems feature many common components and sub-systems. traction motors and generators, power electronics and battery management systems work in much the same way for each. improving one type can benefit all. each alternative drive vehicle also relies on systems like electric power assisted steering, electronic brake control and electric climate control. while earlier vehicles were not built in mass-production numbers, many of the engineers that created them also contributed to the volt development, including chief engineer andrew farah. “by adapting sub-systems such as the ev1-descended motors developed for the front-wheel drive hybrid system and electronically controlled brakes from the fuel cell equinox, the engineers

the bmw i3: advancing automotive sustainabilityhttp://members.beforeitsnews.com/contribute/ headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the following post is a part of triplepundit’s coverage of the 2011 opportunity green conference in los angeles, california. to read all the posts in the series, click here. by kara scharwath when i think about the companies that are leading in the corporate social responsibility space, i have to admit that the automobile industry doesn’t generally make it onto my short list. despite the success of the nissan leaf and the chevy volt, i still have some reservations about just how much greener electric cars really are. in my mind, the materials and energy intensive nature of automobile manufacturing seems like an impossible hurdle to overcome. however, a presentation given by bmw’s manuel sattig at opportunity green 2011 has me rethinking my assumptions. it turns out that among auto manufacturers, bmw is one of the most sustainable in the world. it was ranked as the second most sustainable global vehicle manufacturer by newsweek this year, and is the only car company that has been ranked on the dow jones sustainability index every year since the index’s inception. now bmw is using it’s expansion into the electric vehicle business as an opportunity to question and rethink their entire business. according to sattig, bmw is pursing “electro-mobility,” a concept that goes beyond

Article 4 - who benefits from powertrain electrification?
who benefits from powertrain electrification? (before it's news) the electrification of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles is obviously going to only get more and more common. manufacturers are doing it in order to gain better compliance with the corporate average fuel economy requirements of the government while fleets are purchasing the vehicles for a variety of reasons, including public relations and fuel savings. are there really any benefits for the fleet owner? manufacturers, especially of light-duty and passenger vehicles, are going to be required to meet pretty aggressive cafe standards in the next few years. to comply, they are turning to alternatives with various forms of electrification (hybrid, grid-powered, etc). yet currently, hybrid and plug-ins are only about 1% of the total passenger vehicle sales market in the u.s. light- and medium-duty roi for fleet owners, the choices are not as clear-cut. while oems are being given obvious incentive to make hybrids and battery electrics, those who would purchase them are not quite as sure. for the most part, at least with light- and medium-duty hybrids and electrics, fleets can expect the higher cost to be partially offset by the tax breaks being given at state and federal levels. most of the time, however, this does not fully cover the extra up-front cost of the electrification technology and in the case of battery electrics (including most plug-in hybrids), it may not account for a shorter service life due to battery longevity and replacement costs.

Article 6 - environmentally friendly cars
environmentally friendly cars (before it's news) many of us fondly remember fred flinstone and his foot-powered automobile. unfortunately, the self-powered car never materialized in our real world. instead, we have millions of cars on the road today that all use a lot of gas and produce fumes that are harmful to our environment. environmentally friendly cars are a big step in the right direction. while many still require the use of gasoline the consumption is severely reduced, and to many people that care deeply for the environment that is wonderful news. one of the most popular types of environmentally friendly cars is the hybrid. the hybrid car uses gasoline in order to function, but it does not use gasoline to the same degree that regular cars and trucks do. instead, hybrid cars use gasoline in addition to a battery and motor to power the automobile. the battery helps to make a smaller amount of gas last longer. this means that hybrids often have a much higher mile per gallon (mpg) rating than regular cars. a lot of the top car suppliers have begun selling hybrid cars in order to help people consume less gasoline, especially as gas prices continue to grow. one of the most popular hybrids available is the toyota prius. this model offers a convenient hatchback design and its success and reliability has helped to place hybrids as a viable automobile option even to many of the most severe critics. honda also sells a popular hybrid option, that being their civic hybrid. as hybrids develop further many companies are starting

Article 7 - electric cars not affordable for 5 years, says survey of global car execs
electric cars not affordable for 5 years, says survey of global car execs (before it's news) http://www.lockergnome.com/greaterworld/2011/01/06/electric-cars-not-affordable-for-5-years-says-survey-of-global-car-execs/ that is a sad but probably true statement. the cost of batteries has not declined as slowly as once thought, the rare earths needed for the various electronics in the car, not to mention the powerful magnets needed for the highest efficiency in the motors used, all are contributing to a situation where electricity should be looked upon as something we use to replace coal power for our homes and businesses, and allow cng or hydrogen production to power internal combustion engines for a time. hydrogen has no carbon footprint, and natural gas has much less than gasoline, not to mention that both have no sulfur content, which means acid rain will be of the nitrous acid variety, instead of the much more corrosive and dangerous sulfurous acid kind. the good news, from the stand point of those same interviewed executives, is that electrics will be the fastest growing segment of the market. (of course, this is strictly a pro forma statement, because mathematically it must be!) the article that commented on the survey, from the bbc, also states the rather obvious point that the car manufacturers will be making, and losing money on, electric cars for the near future, because for one thing, they will help the

Article 8 - fact check: stimulus assessments overly optimistic
by frederic j. frommer associated press washington — the obama administration claimed this week that $100 billion invested in innovative technologies under the economic stimulus law is “transforming the american economy” by putting the nation on track for technological breakthroughs in health care, energy and transportation. but an examination of details in the 50-page report unveiled tuesday by vice president joe biden reveals something a bit different: a collection of rosy projections that ignore many of the challenges, pitfalls and economic realities in all those areas. a look at how the administration’s claims compare to the facts: ___ editor’s note — an occasional look at government assertions and how well they adhere to the facts. ___ increasing renewable energy the claim: thanks to the stimulus, the u.s. is on track to “doubling u.s. renewable energy generation capacity and u.s. renewable manufacturing capacity by 2012.” the facts: while the recovery act has helped increase renewable energy, the fact that it is a one-time jolt makes it difficult to project that the growth will continue for the next couple of years. george sterzinger, executive director of the renewable energy policy project, a washington think tank that promotes renewable energy, said the recovery act’s cash grant program for renewable energy projects “jump-started a lot of stuff. but there’s nothing beyond that.” sterzinger added that it would be a mistake to link the growth in renewable energy generation to the growth in american-made renewable energy equipment

Article 4 - personal business; cleaner cars are here, if you can find them
diesel power, the most familiar alternative for improving fuel economy, is a popular choice for buyers of big pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles like the ford f-series, the dodge ram and the chevrolet suburban. analysts expect sales of about 500,000 diesel-powered trucks and s.u.v.'s this year, about the same as last year. but for americans, finding a diesel vehicle can be difficult. the chief source now is volkswagen; diesel versions of its new beetle, jetta and golf have been flying out of showrooms this year. dealers exhausted their supply of 2001 models by mid-july and since then have been taking orders for the 2002 versions, which should start arriving this month. if sales continue at their year-to-date pace, vw dealers will sell about 23,000 diesels this year, about 8 percent of vw's total sales of 365,000 vehicles in the united states. while dealers are urging volkswagen to ship more diesels to america for the 2002 model year, which starts this fall, vw's supply is limited because its diesels are so popular abroad. in europe, more than half the cars sold are diesel-powered; the figure is as high as 75 percent in italy and france. all diesel cars sold by vw in the united states have a 1.9-liter, 90-horsepower turbo-charged engine, which gets above-average gas mileage -- 42 m.p.g

Article 5 - some hybrid vehicles are here; their tax status remains vague
only after that law was passed did hybrids appear -- vehicles that run part-time on electric power, but do not have to be plugged in for recharging, as purely electric vehicles do. ''i wouldn't take tax advice from a car dealer,'' mr. mikrut added, but he did not have definitive advice of his own. a toyota spokeswoman, martha voss, said the company did not contend that the prius was eligible for the electric-vehicle credit but that it qualified for a different tax benefit, a $2,000 clean-vehicle deduction that can be claimed on form 1040. ed cohen, a spokesman for honda, which produces the insight, the only other hybrid vehicle on the market, said his company did not maintain that the insight qualified for either the clean-vehicle deduction or the electric-vehicle credit. both the insight and the prius are fueled with gasoline and use some of the power from the internal combustion engine to make electricity. but in the insight, much less gasoline is turned into electrical energy than in the prius. at the white house, a spokeswoman, claire buchan, said tonight that the bush administration's energy proposal ''clarifies and expands the current law.'' she said it did not specify the structure or the dollar amount of tax credits and that this would be worked out with congress. mr. zubritsky would like the credit but is not eager to be a test case. the tax-form instructions, he noted, say

Article 6 - automakers look beyond electric
in the last decade, a new wave of industry effort on battery power was driven by california's zero-emission vehicle mandate, set in motion in 1990. the z.e.v. mandate, as it is known, will require automakers to derive 10 percent of their sales from highly efficient cars, and some from vehicles with no tailpipe emissions at all. california regulators see this as an attempt to clean the state's air. many automakers view it as a threat to their businesses. california is not just the largest auto market in the united states, but because its clean air rules predate the federal clean air act, other states can follow california's tougher air regulations, as new york and massachusetts do. the z.e.v. mandate was supposed to take effect with the 2003 model year, but has been stalled by a legal challenge from general motors and daimlerchrysler. california regulators plan to rewrite the rule some time next year. still, because it takes years to develop new cars, automakers have been at work. detroit's concerns were intensified after california passed a new regulation this year that will force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year. the latest efforts to build battery-powered electrics have been as frustrating as previous attempts. toyota has sold a few electric rav4 sport utility vehicles in california, but at a considerable loss. ford's worldwide goal was to sell 5,000 think city subcompact cars annually,

Article 7 - tesla plans $5 billion battery factory for mass-market electric car
by building its own factory, tesla would have more control over the supply and cost of its batteries. “with this facility, we feel highly confident of being able to create a compelling and affordable electric car in approximately three years,” elon musk, tesla’s chief executive, and deepak ahuja, its chief financial officer, wrote in a report last week. the automaker expects to reduce the per-kilowatt cost of its battery packs by more than 30 percent by the end of the first year of volume production for its third-generation electric vehicle. at full production, the factory, known as the gigafactory, would produce enough lithium-ion batteries for about 500,000 cars annually by 2020, more than suppliers worldwide produced last year. nevada, arizona, new mexico and texas are among the states tesla said it was considering for the factory. the finished batteries would be shipped to tesla’s assembly plant in fremont, calif. the factory will cover 500 to 1,000 acres and employ up to 6,500 workers, the company said. some analysts said they were surprised that tesla announced the project without having key details, such as partnerships and a site, in place. “i wasn’t expecting a two-step process, with bidding left,” said efraim levy, senior automotive equity analyst at s&p capital iq. the potential uses for mass-market tesla vehicles go far beyond transportation and could help

Article 8 - this summer, electric cars are merging into california’s traffic
“the people who buy this car are the movers and shakers — leaders in arts, entertainment, business,” said paul scott, a co-founder of the advocacy group plug in america who now sells electric leafs at a nissan dealership in downtown los angeles. “i sold a leaf to danny devito,” mr. scott said. “he’s that kind of guy. but you’ve got a lot of people who just will not put themselves into a small car.” on the other hand, he said, celebrities who live large are the ones who “will drive the market” if they embrace upscale electric cars like the tesla, influencing purchases by regular janes and joes. following the model s’s introduction last weekend, tesla is providing thousands of test drives for reservation holders, starting in fremont and los angeles before moving on to a dozen cities across north america. california drivers are also getting a chance to get behind the wheel of the $38,145 electric sedan from coda, based in los angeles, at test-drive events through the summer in southern california and the san francisco bay area. the car will initially be sold through four dealerships in the state. what’s markedly different about the plug-in vehicle market this summer is the growing presence of some of the world’s largest carmakers. ford began slowly delivering its $40,000 focus electric to dealers in may (a month in which just six units were sold) and was expecting to ship

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The automotive industry is shifting towards electrification. Toyota's green hybrids dominate the global market, saving more fuel and CO2 than all EVs combined (Article 1). The Chevrolet Volt builds upon GM's earlier electrification efforts, using technologies from the EV1, two-mode hybrid SUVs, and fuel cell vehicles (Article 2).

BMW is a leader in corporate social responsibility, ranking as the second most sustainable global vehicle manufacturer by Newsweek. They're pursuing ""electro-mobility"" and expanding into electric vehicles to reduce environmental impact (Article 3). However, the electrification of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles poses challenges for fleet owners, who may not see clear benefits or be willing to pay higher upfront costs (Article 4).

The automotive rechargeable battery market is growing rapidly, with a forecasted growth rate of 10.5% CAGR from 2015-2019 (Article 5). Environmentally friendly cars, such as hybrids, are becoming increasingly popular, reducing gasoline consumption and emissions (Article 6).

A survey of global car executives found that electric cars will not be affordable for 5 years, citing high battery costs and rare earth element shortages (Article 7). In contrast, the Obama administration's stimulus assessments have been criticized for being overly optimistic, ignoring challenges and economic realities in areas like renewable energy (Article 8).

Overall, the automotive industry is transitioning towards electr

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Toyota is considering mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) with a range of over 300 km, contrary to its previous strategy of reserving EVs for short-distance commuting. The company aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020, according to reports by Nikkei.

This move would be a reversal of Toyota's current focus on plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs). The company has set up a team dedicated to developing electric cars with a range of over 300 km, which will be based on an existing vehicle platform such as the Prius or Corolla.

Other automakers, including Nissan and Volkswagen, have already promoted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future. Tesla is also planning to build its own battery factory, known as the Gigafactory, to produce enough lithium-ion batteries for about 500,000 cars annually by 2020.

California's zero-emission vehicle mandate will require automakers to derive 10% of their sales from highly efficient cars and some with no tailpipe emissions. The state has passed new regulations that will force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year.

The growing presence of large carmakers in the plug-in vehicle market is expected to increase competition, making electric cars more affordable and accessible to consumers.

Article 1 - eternal whimsy
photo when it comes to theories of the afterlife, most of the world’s major religions have fairly prosaic stuff on offer. only occasionally will a cosmology be really colorful, as it is in greek mythology, where some interesting eschatological options are available. why there should be such a failure of the imagination on this topic is an interesting question. perhaps we feel uncomfortable in such speculation? perhaps we feel that it’s a waste of time to talk about something people have very fixed ideas about — or dismiss as simply wishful thinking? but speculating about who, if anyone, created us and what lies ahead of us can be intellectually engaging and, as david eagleman shows in his new book, “sum,” very entertaining too. the author, a neuro­scientist with literary leanings, has set out a series of possibilities for the afterlife, described in 40 vignettes, each of which presents a different explanation of who god is and why he or she (or, in some cases, they) chose to create us, and what might be planned for us on our demise. and, for the most part, these intentions are very different from what conventional religion would have us believe. most of these future options are extremely amusing, highlighting our self-importance and subjecting us to an astonishing range of humiliations, disappointments and surprises. if you are thinking of dying, this book may not exactly increase your peace of mind. consider some of eagleman’s playfully

Article 2 - nuts and dolts
paranoia is a bipartisan temptation. amid last august’s town hall frenzy, there was a stir over a poll showing that roughly a third of republicans believed that barack obama had been born outside the united states. liberals trumpeted the finding as proof of the republican base’s slide into madness. but conservatives had a rebuttal: as recently as 2007, they pointed out, polls showed that a third of democrats believed george w. bush knew about 9/11 in advance. neither statistic would come as a surprise to a reader of “voodoo histories: the role of the conspiracy theory in shaping modern history,” a sweeping tour of the paranoid style in western politics by david aaronovitch, a british journalist. in his account, which runs from “the protocols of the elders of zion” down to the obsession over obama’s birth certificate, the pendulum of paranoia is constantly swinging from right to left and back again, depending on which faction feels more powerless and put-upon. so the mccarthyite hawks who blamed communist infiltrators for “losing china” gave way, as liberalism declined and conservatism rose to power, to the left-wing paranoiacs who blamed the military-industrial complex for everything from john f. kennedy’s assassination to the murder of an antinuclear activist in margaret thatcher’s britain. the clinton-era conservatives who insisted that vince foster’s suicide was really murder ceded the stage, in

Article 3 - save the date
admit it. you’ve fantasized about time travel. you’ve wondered what it would be like to visit your own past and slap some sense into your younger self. perhaps you’ve imagined having dinner with leonardo, or sitting in the emperor’s box in the roman colosseum. young readers, too, understand the allure. while there is no shortage of children’s books on the subject (my older son became a reader thanks to jon scieszka’s “time warp trio”), “infinity ring: a mutiny in time,” by james dashner, manages to cut a fresh channel in the well-worn time stream. “infinity ring” is planned as a seven-book series with six different authors, of which “a mutiny in time” is the first. dashner, author of “the maze runner,” has outlined the story arc based on a concept developed in-house at scholastic, and will write the seventh and final volume in addition to the first. (i should mention i worked with scholastic on “the 39 clues,” which was created in roughly the same fashion.) like “the 39 clues,” “infinity ring” provides an opportunity for stealth education, as it plunges readers into the past and encourages them to think about cause and effect. the publisher has also provided a multiplatform experience to support the books, including a web site with games that allow young readers to pursue their own time-travel adventures. the concept behind the series:

Article 4 - close encounters
we were just another family living on long island in the late 1960's, but we were also the family from another planet. although the books of archbishop fulton j. sheen decorated our shelves, they were little more than props from the days when our faith-doubting father sought catholic church blessing to marry our mother, an irish farm girl who had been orphaned and then air-mailed to relatives in brooklyn. and for every one of these unopened books about the mysteries of our faith, there were 10 about the mysteries of our universe: u.f.o.'s, extrasensory perception, reincarnation and other subjects tiptoeing into blasphemy. our father may have looked like the typical wall street salesman, commuting daily on the long island rail road, but he was not. his pessimistic worldview, cemented by a depression-era childhood, was tempered by an optimistic belief in extraterrestrial life that was rooted in the same lousy childhood. he corresponded with other conspiracy theorists, collected photographs of plausible sightings and even participated in a panel discussion on the subject at hofstra university, while his children sat in the back of the auditorium, eating french fries and basking in the reflected glory of a father finally being recognized for his mastery of a potentially world-shaking discipline. the pursuit of u.f.o.'s became integral to our family life. there were late-night phone calls, strange packages in the mail and unsettling discussions lasting until

Article 5 - homeownership has its perils
video the dread gathers and surges while the blood scarcely trickles in “the conjuring,” a fantastically effective haunted-house movie. set largely in 1971, it purports to tell a story based on “true case files” about a family of seven whose pastoral dream became a nightmare soon after they moved into a rhode island farmhouse. one day, mom, dad and the girls are settling into their conveniently sprawling, creaking, squeaking two-story house — the rooms quickly become a disorienting maze — and the next, they’re playing hide and creep with a mysterious, increasingly malevolent force. the director james wan plays much the same game with you. written by the brothers chad hayes and carey w. hayes, the movie opens with a jittery, funny prologue involving a couple of pretty nurses right out of a roger corman quickie, a devil doll named annabelle (shades of rod serling and chucky) and a pair of married paranormal experts, ed and lorraine warren (patrick wilson and vera farmiga). the warrens quickly take care of business, and mr. wan does the same. with shock cuts, gliding camera movements, muted colors that evoke david fincher’s “zodiac” and tricks learned from “the twilight zone,” mr. wan — whose first sly shot is of a cracked, smiling face — sets a relentlessly uneasy tone that imperceptively shifts between intense seriousness and lightly

Article 6 - america’s war for reality
exclusive: the united states has been on a three-decade binge of unreality, imbibing delusions that began with ronald reagan and have continued through the tea party. the challenge now is for rational americans to show they have the toughness and tenacity to fight for the real world — and to save it, writes robert parry. by robert parry the real struggle confronting the united states is not between the right and the left in any traditional sense, but between those who believe in reality and those who are entranced by unreality. it is a battle that is testing whether fact-based people have the same determination to fight for their real-world view as those who operate in a fact-free space do in defending their illusions. these battle lines do relate somewhat to the right/left divide because today’s right-wing has embraced ideological propaganda as truth more aggressively and completely than those on the left, though the left (and the center, too) are surely not immune from the practice of ignoring facts in pursuit of some useful agit-prop. but key elements of the american right have set up permanent residence in the world of make-believe, making any commonsense approach to the real-world challenges nearly politically impossible. the right’s fantasists also have the passions of true-believers, like a cult that gets angrier the more its views are questioned. so, it doesn’t matter that scientific evidence proves global warming is real; the deniers will insist the facts are simply a government p

Article 7 - a boy’s life, guided by the voice of cosmic wonder
no matter. for me, with the receipt of that letter, a circle had been closed. now it has opened again, and i have lost a distant grandfather of sorts. to the world at large arthur c. clarke was probably best known as the co-creator with stanley kubrick of the classic 1968 movie “2001: a space odyssey,” a visual tone poem featuring a malevolent computer named hal and a pair of astronauts in search of a mysterious monolith that seems to be the key to the origin and evolution of humanity. but clarke* was much more than a science fiction writer. a genuine rocket scientist, he predicted in 1945 in the journal wireless world that satellites in geosynchronous orbits would be used as “extra-terrestrial relays” for broadcasting to the earth below. the concept he had been pushing for the last few decades, of an elevator to space, might yet become a reality. as he said last fall on the 50th anniversary of sputnik, people stopped laughing at it a long time ago. to space fans and perpetual adolescents everywhere he was simply the deceptively dry voice of cosmic wonder. few writers have seemed to inhabit the cosmos, its grandeur, mystery and, yes, its ultimate coldness, with such aplomb, from the balletic spaceships and the mysterious fetus of “2001” to the jesuit astronaut in the mischievous short story “the star.” the astronaut

Article 8 - vegetable love, requited
photo like everything else in my life, salads grow more complicated in the fall. in june and july, i like lettuce plain, with olive oil and vinegar splashed on straight from the bottle, plus salt and pepper. it is one of the skills i am secretly exceptionally proud of, this ability to dress a salad in the bowl without mixing up the dressing on the side first. i am convinced that salad tastes better this way, though i can’t figure out why. and i enjoy doing it — i feel more in tune with the greens, and also more picturesque (which, by the way, is a vast and unexplored category of human satisfaction). if you don’t already know how to do it, here is the secret: use more oil than you think you should, less vinegar than you think you should, and be generous with the salt. lettuce hates the heat of august, and while its timing couldn’t be worse — that’s just when we need its crisp, cool simplicity the most — i can’t say that i blame it. i let it have its month off and switch to tomatoes: tomatoes with garlic or onion or both, puddles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and bread to sop it all up. come september, lettuce returns — most local farmers plant a second crop timed for this month’s cooler days. but now summer’s slapdash freedom is replaced by rules and measurements, and my tender leaves are weighted down with much more stuff: fruits

Article 1 - cowboys de gregory facing year-long suspension: report | reuters
sports news | fri nov 11, 2016 | 2:39pm est cowboys de gregory facing year-long suspension: report (the sports xchange) - dallas cowboys defensive end randy gregory, already serving two suspensions totaling 14 games for multiple violations of the nfl's drug policy, now may be facing a year-long suspension. gregory has failed another drug test, sources informed of the situation told the nfl network. gregory served a four-game suspension to start the season for his first substance-abuse violation and is currently serving a 10-game suspension for violating the league's policy for a second time. the defensive end's next suspension will be for a full year. the report would mean he has failed a sixth test -- his fifth while a member of the cowboys. the nebraska product tested positive for marijuana at the nfl scouting combine in 2015. gregory checked himself into a treatment center during the summer but reportedly later left the facility and missed a scheduled drug test. a missed test carries the same weight as a failed test. gregory, who turns 24 later this month, was placed on the reserve/did not report list and did not take part in training camp. the cowboys selected gregory late in the second round in 2015 with the 60th overall pick. he played in 12 games last season but had little impact, compiling 12 tackles with no sacks.

Article 2 - for cowboys, mood swings are just another part of their seesaw season
after replacing the benched drew bledsoe in the second half of the giants’ game, quarterback tony romo made his n.f.l. starting debut in the cowboys’ game at charlotte. the 26-year-old romo, who is as even-tempered as parcells is emotional, rallied the cowboys from a 14-point deficit against the panthers on the strength of a 25-point fourth quarter. the day after the victory against carolina, parcells sounded less like a man on the verge of retirement than a golfer who birdies the 18th hole after making a mess of the first 17. he said he would take the abuse “i took in this business twice a day for about two years to feel just like i did last night once.” photo the dark clouds were back the next week after a 22-19 loss to washington in which terrell owens dropped a pass that probably would have gone for a 74-yard touchdown. mike vanderjagt’s potential game-winning 35-yard field goal with seconds left was blocked and a face-mask penalty by the cowboys’ kyle kosier on the ensuing return made possible the redskins’ winning kick with no time left. “it is trying on me,” parcells said, referring to his team’s mistake-prone play. “it is, there’s no doubt. but that’s the way the game is.” the cowboys’ next game was at arizona

cowboys reportedly make decision on tony romo's week 10 status the cowboys veteran quarterback was fully cleared to play earlier this week 34s ago • 2 min read it looks like the dallas cowboys aren't quite ready to see tony romo suit up for a regular season game. according to nfl.com , romo isn't expected to be active for the cowboys game in pittsburgh on sunday vs/ the steelers . the decision to make romo a healthy scratch means the quarterback will miss his ninth game of the year. romo has been sidelined since aug. 25 when he injured his back in a preseason game against the seahawks . the veteran quarterback, who was just fully cleared to practice this week, was on the field as a full participant for the cowboys' practices on both wednesday and thursday. tony romo isn't expected to suit up on sunday. usatsi the reason the cowboys have decided to keep romo sidelined this week is because he's still technically rehabbing, even though he's been cleared to play. according to nfl.com, romo will have completed his rehab if he makes it through this week of practice, which means he just has to make it through friday's session. since romo has been medically cleared, that means the decision to make him inactive this week came from the coaching staff . before wednesday's practice, cowboys coach jason garrett made it clear that they

Article 4 - strong-armed romo continues to lift cowboys
bill parcells, the cowboys’ no-nonsense coach, tried to wipe that smile off romo’s face. asked to comment on romo’s five touchdowns, parcells said: “i could have thrown those first two.” but even parcells had trouble sustaining his usual acerbity when talking about romo’s performance. “i think he is a football guy and he is interested in playing well,” he said, then smirked. “we got a ways to go here, so put the anointing oil away.” but facts are facts. after not attempting a pass in his first three n.f.l. seasons, romo, 26, has completed 10 for touchdowns in the past five games. the cowboys, who were 3-3 when romo took over the offense, have re-entered the national football conference championship picture. behind romo, who is 4-1 as a starter, the cowboys are 7-4 and in first place in the n.f.c. east, ahead of the giants whom they will face dec. 3 on the road. “we’ve just got good talent out there on both sides of the ball,” romo said. he deflected praise about his performance, saying, “we have so many weapons on the outside that sometimes you feel like, who are you going to give the ball to this game?” being the quarterback of the cowboys is one of the more exalted positions in sports,

critics are looking through the lenses of a 1-6 record in elimination games since romo took over in the middle of the 2006 season. and the last thing they saw was a huge interception that ended a chance to beat washington and sent romo to his third loss in five seasons in playoff-or-bust finales against an n.f.c. east rival. jones’s glasses — call them rose-colored — see that playoff win as the only time a quarterback not named troy aikman won in the postseason since the cowboys stopped winning super bowls nearly two decades ago. he also wonders where the cowboys would be without romo, given that they were second to last in the n.f.l. in rushing a season ago with a struggling offensive line, and they had an unreliable defense. romo is the franchise leader in touchdown passes and is probably two seasons away from catching aikman in yards and completions. that is where jones was coming from when he started hinting in the statement announcing romo’s contract extension that romo would be something of a player-chief executive when it comes to the dallas offense. jones showed he was not kidding by seeking romo’s input before dallas drafted wisconsin center/guard travis frederick late in the first round and grabbed a complement to tight end jason witten in gavin escobar of san diego state in the second. neither player was projected as high as he was picked. j

Article 6 - donte whitner on the cowboys: 'they're very frustrating' to play against
moments ago • 2 min read the dallas cowboys are 10-1 and riding high atop the nfc and the entire nfl after defeating washington, 31-26, on thanksgiving . you don't get to 10-1 without making some opponents hate the very thought of playing against you along the way, and that's apparently exactly what the cowboys have done this year. just ask washington safety donte whitner .

""to put the ball on the ground when you get to them, when you sack them. this quarterback doesn't do that. ... that's why he's playing so well. he understands situations, he's not trying to turn the football over, and he's taking this opportunity and running with it."" defensive end chris baker echoed those thoughts. ""[dak prescott] showed a lot of poise, made the plays that he was supposed to make whether it was using his feet or making that perfect throw in the corner,"" baker said.

Article 7 - how the sam bradford deal impacts tony romo and five places he could end up in 2017
how the sam bradford deal impacts tony romo and five places he could end up in 2017 how the sam bradford deal impacts tony romo and five places he could end up in 2017 tony romo sounds like he wants to play again, but the big question for the veteran qb is where what a difference a year makes. tony romo's future jones: dak not looking over shoulder a year ago, quarterback tony romo was viewed as the dallas cowboys ' most indispensable player. dallas was in the middle of a season where chances to repeat as nfc east champions were derailed because of romo's broken collarbone that limited him to just four games. owner jerry jones was receiving criticism for failing to address the backup quarterback position in any meaningful way since kyle orton's departure. the cowboys went 1-11 without romo. a similar fate was expected this season when romo fractured a vertebra in his back during the third preseason game against the seattle seahawks on aug. 25. romo was initially expected to miss six to 10 weeks because of the injury. everything changed for romo -- and the cowboys -- when he was tackled by cliff avril on this play. usatsi dallas has the nfl 's best record this season at 8-1 without romo largely because of the surprising play of rookie quarterback dak prescott and 201

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The Dallas Cowboys are facing a year-long suspension for defensive end Randy Gregory, who has failed another drug test. This would be his fifth failed test while with the team. Gregory's previous suspensions totaled 14 games.

Quarterback Tony Romo is expected to miss his ninth game of the season due to injury and is still technically rehabbing, despite being medically cleared. Coach Jason Garrett made the decision to keep him sidelined this week.

Romo has been playing well, completing 10 touchdowns in the past five games, and the Cowboys are re-entering the NFC Championship picture with a 7-4 record. Critics argue that Romo's success is due to his ability to avoid turnovers and take chances with the football.

The Cowboys' next game is against the Arizona Cardinals, while their arch-rivals, the Washington Redskins, face off against them on Thanksgiving Day. The Redskins are coming off a 42-24 win over Green Bay and are seeking to improve their record against the Cowboys in this historic rivalry.

Defensive end Chris Baker praised quarterback Dak Prescott's poise and ability to make plays, while safety Donte Whitner described the Cowboys as ""frustrating"" to play against due to their ability to avoid turnovers.

Article 1 - two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says
09pm gmt two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says bogota two marxist farc rebels were killed in combat and another surrendered in colombia's northern bolivar province when they left their pre-determined zone carrying weapons, the military said on wednesday, the first time the bilateral ceasefire has been broken. colombia's government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) signed a peace accord in september that was rejected in a plebiscite last month. the two sides finalised a revised deal over the weekend that aims to end 52 years of conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. thousands of farc fighters have been left in limbo by the rejection on oct. 2 of the original peace accord. until they disarm, rebels remain in predetermined areas and must provide coordinates to the military if they want to leave. the rebels were extorting people in the area some 68 km (42 miles) from the area of concentration and carrying weapons, the military said in a statement. a decision on how the new accord will be approved has not yet been made, but it appears more likely to go through congress rather than face another national vote. president juan manuel santos ordered the ceasefire with the rebels in august.

Article 2 - colombia to ratify peace deal with rebels in congress
president juan manuel santos said friday he will have colombia's congress ratify a modified peace deal with the nation's largest rebel group after voters rejected the first pact last month in a referendum. speaking in washington , santos said implementing the accord in the shortest time possible would prevent a fragile cease-fire from falling apart. his comments came after two rebels of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia were killed in combat with security forces during a confusing incident now being investigated by united nations-sponsored monitors. santos announced a week ago that farc agreed to modify the peace accord defeated in a referendum, but he had been cagey about how he intended to implement the deal. officials said no decision had been made on whether the modified deal might be presented to voters in another referendum. santos was addressing the organization of american states after the hemispheric group endorsed the deal. the accord is intended to end a half-century-long conflict that has claimed more than 220,000 lives and driven almost 8 million people from their homes. 0 shares email star comments "" colombia to ratify peace deal with rebels in congress settles trump university suits for $25m "" 'troubling things' in record of trump's attorney general pick, democratic senator says "" what to know about mike pompeo, trump's pick to lead the cia "" 23 students injured in nashville school bus crash: authorities "" nasa's peggy whitson becomes oldest woman in space "" ob

''to do away with it would be doing away with the most important program of the pastrana administration, which is the peace process,'' said armando borrero, a political scientist and former national security adviser to president ernesto samper, who was mr. pastrana's predecessor. still, no one is arguing that the talks have produced much in the way of tangible results or that the outlook is rosy. supporters of mr. pastrana's administration say he has taken great steps to build an environment of trust in which peace talks could flourish. in early november, he announced the creation of a peace coalition with the opposition leader horacio serpa. in recent speeches, the president has also spoken passionately about the need to resume talks and avoid war. the short time frame is meant to put pressure on the rebels, giving them a closing window for rejoining peace talks. right now they have been at a peak of their strength, but their critics say that the paramilitary forces are pounding them and that government actions to take away their drug trade are bound to have some effect. in talks leading up to the decision wednesday, mr. pastrana consulted a cross section of government officials and others familiar with the conflict to shore up political support. newsletter sign up continue reading the

Article 7 - dna suggests that boy in chávez rescue effort was long gone from jungle rebels
but that deal crumbled after numerous delays, handing mr. chávez an embarrassing setback in his mediation with the guerrillas. president álvaro uribe of colombia, with whom mr. chávez recently exchanged pointed insults, announced on new year’s eve the possibility that emmanuel could be in bogotá, not with the rebels. “uribe has a political triumph, but the scenario has become more difficult for the captives,” said león valencia, a security analyst in bogotá. “this will have an important political cost for chávez, who is left as someone who made the mistake of believing the farc was going to comply with what they said.” the farc, at war with colombia’s government for four decades, also emerges with a weaker image from the failed hostage transfer. while the rebel group is still feared as an insurgency that finances itself with cocaine trafficking and ransom demands, details of the boy’s existence suggested that the group’s commanders were lying or may have simply lost track of him. mario iguarán, colombia’s attorney general, said the dna tests performed on the boy and on ms. rojas’s mother and brother showed a “probability of truth” that he was emmanuel. mr. iguarán said he was sending colombian geneticists to a laboratory in spain to corroborate the results. colombian officials said this week that they first learned that emmanuel could be in foster care in bog

Title: two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says
Content: two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says 36pm bogota (reuters) - two marxist farc rebels were killed in combat and another surrendered in colombia's northern bolivar province when they left their pre-determined zone carrying weapons, the military said on wednesday, the first time the bilateral ceasefire has been broken. colombia's government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) signed a peace accord in september that was rejected in a plebiscite last month. the two sides finalised a revised deal over the weekend that aims to end 52 years of conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. thousands of farc fighters have been left in limbo by the rejection on oct. 2 of the original peace accord. until they disarm, rebels remain in predetermined areas and must provide coordinates to the military if they want to leave. the rebels were extorting people in the area some 68 km (42 miles) from the area of concentration and carrying weapons, the military said in a statement. a decision on how the new accord will be approved has not yet been made, but it appears more likely to go through congress rather than face another national vote. president juan manuel santos ordered the ceasefire with the rebels in august.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have been in talks to end a 52-year conflict. The government and FARC signed a peace accord in September, but it was rejected in a referendum on October 2. A revised deal was announced, which will be submitted to Congress for approval.

Two FARC rebels were killed in combat with security forces in Bogota's northern Bolivar province, breaking the bilateral ceasefire. President Juan Manuel Santos has ordered the ceasefire and hopes to avoid mistakes made in previous talks.

A new peace accord is set to be signed on Thursday, after a previous agreement was rejected by voters. The revised document will be submitted to Congress for approval, rather than put to another referendum.

FARC leader Rodrigo Londono announced a unilateral two-month cease-fire, which began on Monday and will last until January 20. The government's head negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, said there would be no concessions of a military character or a cease-fire.

The accord aims to end the conflict that has killed over 220,000 people and displaced millions. The government and FARC have been in talks for four years, hammering out a deal to end the war.

Article 8: Mark Levin argues that Republicans must use the judicial filibuster to protect liberty and prevent another radical leftist on the Supreme Court.","The US Supreme Court's ideological balance is shifting. President Obama has appointed four liberal justices, including Merrick Garland, who was nominated but not confirmed due to the election of Donald Trump. The court now has a 5-4 conservative majority.

Donald Trump will fill the vacant seat left by Justice Scalia and may appoint additional conservative justices, potentially altering the court's balance for decades. The next president could also replace three aging justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83), Anthony Kennedy (80), and Stephen Breyer (78).

The Senate's filibuster rule has been changed to favor Democrats, allowing them to confirm liberal judges more easily. However, Republicans are concerned about the court's balance and may try to block future Democratic nominations.

Some Republican senators, including Johnny Isakson and David Perdue, have expressed willingness to consider Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominees if she wins the presidency. The election has opened up opportunities for Trump to shape the court's ideology.

The shift in the court's balance could lead to significant changes in areas such as abortion, campaign finance, gun restrictions, and environmental regulations.

Article 1 - building legacy, obama reshapes appellate bench
the full appeals court agreed this month to hear halbig v. burwell, a case that could unravel the system of federal insurance exchanges established by the affordable care act. before democrats curtailed republicans’ right to use filibusters, which they accomplished by rewriting senate rules through a maneuver known as “the nuclear option,” the district of columbia court was dominated by judges who were appointed by republican presidents. today it has four republican appointees and seven democratic appointees, four of whom mr. obama picked. with control of the senate at stake in november’s midterm elections, the success of democrats in reshaping the courts is a reminder of the subtle power that the majority party has even in a moribund congress. republicans, who have watched with growing alarm as the obama nominees passed through the senate, have begun raising the issue as they try to win six seats they need to take the majority. “it’s no surprise that president obama has been able to transform the ideological makeup of the courts — that happens when you have six years to pick judges and your party controls the senate,” said edward whelan, the president of the ethics and public policy center, who was a senior official in the justice department under president george w. bush. “the best way for conservative voters to prevent further damage to the courts is to swing the senate to republican control in the elections this november.” though the obama administration was well on its way to leaving a lasting liberal

Article 2 - after ruling critical of n.s.a., uncertain terrain for appeal
judge leon was dismissive of the government’s halfhearted argument on this point, saying it “defies common sense.” the main initial critique of judge leon’s decision was that it blew past the closest supreme court precedent and tried to anticipate where the justices might be heading based on concurring rather than controlling opinions in a 2012 decision. the next stop for the case is the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, which, thanks to the recent overhaul of the senate’s filibuster rule, has a majority of democratic appointees among its active judges. video but it may be that nothing turns on that. writing recently in judicature magazine, judge douglas h. ginsburg, who was appointed to the district of columbia circuit by president ronald reagan, noted with satisfaction that a recent empirical study had absolved his court “of the charge, so often leveled in the vacuous but vociferous political debates over the confirmation of a new judge, that the court is a political partisan.” his own 2010 opinion in united states v. maynard, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel with two judges appointed by a republican president, tends to illustrate his point. the decision, which will be helpful to the challengers to the data collection program, was, curiously, mentioned only in passing by judge leon. judge ginsburg said the collection of huge troves of data over long stretches of time, producing a

(cnn) questions about the supreme court never rank very highly on american voters' list of concerns. but if there was one issue this election that kept republicans in donald trump's corner even at his worst, it was the fear that handing hillary clinton the ability to fill justice antonin scalia's seat would cost conservatives the supreme court for a generation. brett talley saving the supreme court became for many the chief argument for trump's candidacy, and trump produced not one but two lists of jurists he would consider should he win the election. these candidates were highly qualified and uniformly conservative. but the never trump wing of the republican party didn't buy it. they argued that conservatives were naïve to think trump would keep his word, speculating that any picks he would actually make would be as bad if not worse than hillary clinton's. now that trump has won, we are about to find out who was right. trump's decision will determine

Article 4 - in setting priorities, democrats give up confirmation battle
senator patrick j. leahy, the vermont democrat who will become the chairman of the judiciary committee and who led the opposition to mr. olson's confirmation, said today in an interview that his priority would now be to block any judicial nominees put forward by president bush who were so conservative they would tip the balance of the federal courts. ''we shouldn't allow any president to engage in ideological court-packing, either from the right or the left,'' mr. leahy said. even though mr. olson won confirmation, the vote was close, 51 to 47. only two democrats voted in favor of the nomination -- senators zell miller of georgia and ben nelson of nebraska -- a fact that surprised senate republicans and the white house. it was closer than the 58-to-42 vote in which john ashcroft was confirmed as attorney general in february after a bruising five-week confirmation battle. after conferring over the last two days, senator leahy and senator tom daschle of south dakota, who will become the majority leader, decided this morning that it was best not to try to block the olson nomination, congressional officials said.

goodbye to all those hopes for a new, liberal supreme court and farewell, merrick garland. cristian farias legal affairs reporter, the huffington post alex wong/getty images the highly qualified merrick garland is not going to be a supreme court justice. judge merrick garland was possibly hoping that americans would choose hillary clinton as their next president and thus push the republican-controlled senate to quickly confirm him to the supreme court . any such hope collapsed tuesday night. the election of donald trump made it virtually impossible for president barack obama’s nominee to be elevated to the nation’s highest court. and that means democrats are once again denied a dream they’ve held for a generation : to see a liberal tilt in the supreme court’s membership. with trump as president, republicans, who spent millions to keep control of the senate , can also secure their grip on the high court for years to come ― by naming justices who are more conservative and far younger than the 63-year-old garland. the goal will be to fill not just the seat left vacant by the death of justice antonin scalia , but also any additional vacancies that may open up. the supreme court is growing older ― justice ruth bader ginsburg is 83, justice anthony kennedy is 80, and justice stephen breyer is 78 ― so another empty seat is certainly possible over the next four years. tom williams/cq roll

Content: photo even though the supreme court has been an active player in american politics — bush v. gore leaps quickly to mind — the process of choosing its members has been seen as mattering more than the partisan combat in congress. with rare exceptions, nominees to the court have been largely insulated from the escalating political warfare over the judiciary, and have been approved. justice antonin scalia, a conservative standard-bearer, was confirmed with 98 votes. ruth bader ginsburg, a liberal icon, got 96. even clarence thomas, whose confirmation hearings marked a flash point in sexual and racial politics, drew no filibuster. now, however, partly as a result of its own actions, but more important as a result of increasing polarization in washington and the nation as a whole, the court is devolving into a nakedly partisan tool. how did this happen? some of the blame rests with the democrats. many of them over the years have played to their base by casting cost-free votes against republican nominees. republicans like to say that democrats’ 1987 blocking of robert bork marked the beginning of the politicization of supreme court nominations, but democrats did give mr. bork a vote. the polarization of the court itself, with a pronounced rightward swing among its conservatives, has also helped turn confirmations into political battles. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from op-ed columnists, the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. but the lion’s share of the blame now belongs to one man — mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader. in blocking even a hearing for judge merrick garland, president barack obama’s moderate and eminently qualified candidate, as well as dozens of obama nominees for other positions, he deeply degraded the nominating process. there was a time when the leaders of the senate were responsible stewards of republican traditions and ideals. not mr. mcconnell, whose determination to steamroll and humiliate political opponents exceeds any other consideration. advertisement continue reading the main story which brings us — and the nation — to the unfolding mess in the senate over president trump’s nomination of judge neil gorsuch. on monday, senate democrats secured the votes needed to filibuster judge gorsuch’s nomination, a procedural mechanism the senate minority party can use to stall or block a vote by the majority. whether democrats will or will not remains to be seen. but many of them are still furious, and rightly so, that

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US Supreme Court's ideological balance is shifting. President Obama has appointed four liberal justices, including Merrick Garland, who was nominated but not confirmed due to the election of Donald Trump. The court now has a 5-4 conservative majority.

Donald Trump will fill the vacant seat left by Justice Scalia and may appoint additional conservative justices, potentially altering the court's balance for decades. The next president could also replace three aging justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (83), Anthony Kennedy (80), and Stephen Breyer (78).

The Senate's filibuster rule has been changed to favor Democrats, allowing them to confirm liberal judges more easily. However, Republicans are concerned about the court's balance and may try to block future Democratic nominations.

Some Republican senators, including Johnny Isakson and David Perdue, have expressed willingness to consider Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominees if she wins the presidency. The election has opened up opportunities for Trump to shape the court's ideology.

The shift in the court's balance could lead to significant changes in areas such as abortion, campaign finance, gun restrictions, and environmental regulations. Democrats are now focused on blocking conservative judges and preserving a liberal tilt on the court.

Article 4 - autumn-year’s last & loveliest smile
autumn-year’s last & loveliest smile (before it's news) “autumn is the season where every leaf turns into a flower.” autumn is a wonderful season which denotes the incoming of winters and ending of summers. autumn also known as fall was started from september 22 when the autumnal equinox took place marking the end of summer and the start of fall across the northern hemisphere. autumn is a wonderful season in which farmers harvest their crops, lots of festivals, migrations, winter preparations, and of course, spectacular foliage. as autumn is the beginning of winters, so people across the north began to feel crisp chill in the evening air, color of leaves is changing, preparations for hallowing are started for which people are gathering apples and pumpkins and the animals and birds start migrating. given here are some beautiful pictures of the wonderful autumn season. an amazing picture of inntal valley covered by fog all over where the famous mountain nordkette can be seen was captured by dominic ebenbichler on october 23, 2012 which was a sunny autumn day in the western austrian province of tyrol. a vivacious image of raindrops gathered on the autumn leaves of small bushes was photographed by andy clark in north vancouver, british columbia, on october 12, 2012. this is the comeback of rain after a record-breaking dry spell since august, over the area. luke macgregor captured the picture of the

Article 7 - wroclaw: poland’s riverside treasure
wroclaw: poland’s riverside treasure headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! wroclaw (pronounced vrot-swav) is situated on the river oder ( or odra) in western poland. the oder branches throughout the city forming 12 islands, which are connected to each other by over one hundred bridges creating a ‘venice of poland’. the soaring architecture, romantic river, and overall free-spirited feel of wroclaw may come as a surprise to travelers who are familiar with the city’s tortuous history of invasion and international power struggles. wroclaw has only been part of poland since 1945 (formerly breslau of germany) and most of the city, including its medieval quarter and many churches, was destroyed during world war ii. the efforts over the last few years to restore the city and move forward to a free future are reflected everywhere and animate the city with a sense of new life and energy. market square in wroclaw the center of wroclaw is the market square (rynek). during my trip, i particularly enjoyed walking around the colorful cobblestone pathways and taking in the unique architecture, as well as frequenting the traditional polish restaurants. when traveling to wroclaw i expected to find delicious foods like pierogi and all the kielbasa i could hope for, but i didn’t know that the wroclaw ry

next to her, hanging on the door to her office, was a poster with a quotation by tristan tzara, the dadaist poet. ''i have a mad and starry desire to assassinate beauty,'' it read. ''the old kind, of course.'' also on the door was a postcard of sculpture by richard serra and a zipper, sewn into a swatch of fabric, that makes a perfect right angle. it is difficult to imagine, in speaking to her, that ms. bright hasn't made a note to herself, somewhere on a list, to reinvent the wheel. ms. bright, whose studio of three, including mr. paskin, is working on curtains for new york residences for christy turlington, the model, and janice and billy crystal, is not an interior designer, though she understands what gives style and life to a room. and she is not an architect, though she has introduced much of architecture's discipline and invention into her craft. she is, in a weird 19th-century sense that won't go away, simply a curtain maker, here in the 21st century. the studio, with its eight sewing machines, two wall-mounted grommet makers, chart-size samples and 30-foot-long worktable with a battery of yardsticks, looks like a war room where what is being waged is drapes.

“neukölln is more grass-roots than other, more artistically established neighborhoods in berlin,” said andreas fiedler, the center’s swiss-born curator. “but here are a lot of artist spaces and a lot of artists produce here.” “the success of berlin as a center for artists is because of who is here, who has been here, and the freedom that is based on the myth of the ‘90s,” he continued, referring to the decade after the fall of the berlin wall when the city exploded with art and refurbishment. “it’s still a very liberal city, and you can realize here what you can’t necessarily in other parts of europe.” that is evident in the main hall of the art center, the only room currently open to the public, where a two-seat yellow plane dangles from the 20-meter, or 65-foot, ceiling of the former boiler house of kindl beer. the facility’s massive room helped to draw the installation that will anchor the new art center’s first phase. “kitfox experimental,” by the 76-year-old swiss artist roman signer, who is known for his outrageous outdoor installations, is an assemble-yourself airplane (the popular kitfox brand), with two large fans blowing from opposite walls to move the plane in a circular motion. it hangs upside down, spinning from the force of the fans, and their deafening sound adds to the almost movielike sense that the plane is spiraling

called the secession, it held its own exhibitions and found a steady source of patronage in the city's wealthy bourgeois elite. in line with his outsider status, klimt worked a bit at being a character. he took to dressing in blue, muumuu-like floor-length smocks inside and outside the studio, and had himself photographed in them, looking soulful. i've always had trouble with klimt's iconic figurative paintings. their insistent visual flash looks as hard and sleek as the surface of a credit card; their sexiness seems lacquered over and their byzantine theatricality slightly silly and already old-fashioned. (it's useful to remember that cubism was being invented in paris at the same time.) but the 15 landscapes in the clark show, organized by stephan koja, a curator at the galerie belvedere in vienna, are different. they aren't particularly innovative paintings: they are basically a goulash of impressionism, symbolism and 19th-century austrian realism. but they have an appealing elasticity and fleetness, and a sense of unmystical mystery. they share the sensuality of klimt's pattern-wrapped figures, but add breath and a pulse. many of the landscapes were done during klimt's annual summer stays in the austrian and italian countryside; he painted them for himself, not on commission. the earliest in the show are near-abstract expanses of flickering water

Title: design world gears up for the autumn festivals
Content: yet most festivals also program events with a broader appeal to attract design enthusiasts as well as professionals. and the most culturally ambitious festivals, like those in vienna and gwangju, have emerged as impromptu training grounds for a new generation of design curators in leading museums. one of the most dynamic festivals is dutch design week, which will stage more than 400 events in eindhoven from oct. 17 to 25. eindhoven has emerged as a global center of design experimentation as students have flocked to design academy eindhoven, europe’s most influential design school, and stayed in the city after graduation to set up studios in the derelict factories and warehouses offered to young designers for low rents by the local council. several hundred thousand people travel to eindhoven each year to explore the city’s design scene during dutch design week. few other places have as strong a design ethos, or such staunch political support, yet other festivals have tried to develop distinctive strands of programming (as vienna design week has done with passionswege). photo a recurrent theme of beijing design week, for example, is the regeneration of dashilar, one of the few surviving historic areas of the city. young chinese designers show their work there during the festival alongside exhibitions celebrating dashilar’s craft heritage. craft is also a focus of design week mexico, which will run from oct. 21 to 25 in mexico city with the first of a series of exhibitions exploring the artisanal skills of particular regions, starting with chiapas in southern mexico. an annual highlight of the brussels design september festival is europe’s biggest flea market for late 20th-century design, the brussels design market. more than 100 european dealers will descend on the city this weekend to sell their wares in an early 1900s harbor station. the most popular features of the london design festival, which began in 2003, are its collaborations with the city’s museums. during this autumn’s festival, running from sept. 19 to 27, the british designer max lamb is to exhibit at the somerset house cultural center the furniture he has made from a single ash tree on his grandfather’s farm. an exhibition at the victoria & albert museum, meanwhile, will explore the experimental objects made from wood by the late robin day, one of britain’s best known 20th-century furniture designers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the quality of the projects in the bigger festivals, like london’s and brussels’, is so erratic that navigating the events can be tricky. the london festival hopes to strengthen its program by introducing

Article 1 - krugman and stiglitz: crazy austerity policies inflict untold damage on economy
though there wasn’t too much talk of specific politicians last night, the election certainly hung in air as the two most cited economists in the world met on stage in new york city to discuss where the economy is headed. the event was hosted by the institute for new economic thinking (inet), shakespeare & company booksellers, and the fashion institute of technology, which, as president joyce f. brown reminded the audience, is a premier public institution that has suffered from budget cuts in a shaky economy. she stressed that she worries each day about the economic conditions students will face when they graduate. robert johnson, executive director of inet, served as moderator, and kicked off the evening praising krguman and stiglitz as his nominees should the prize of most courageous economist ever be offerred. johnson himself is an economist who has not shied away from tough criticism of the field and policies that hurt the 99 percent. (stiglitz and johnson were both contributers to the alternet book i co-edited, the 99%: how the occupy movement is changing america). the discussion touched on many themes, but the increasing need for economists — and politicians — to learn the lessons of history was a key point. both krugman and stigtliz appeared troubled that much of our economic misery is not the result of uncontrollable forces, but self-inflicted pain springing from a failure to appreciate the lessons learned in past crises and to understand the role of

Article 2 - opinion - conservative
income inequality % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) what do you make of the president challenging the fairness of income distribution in our free market economy? they are making a major effort to convince america that there is something inherently unfair about our economic system and the government must oversee a redistribution of wealth to resolve the problem. the problem is their argument is baseless. they compare household incomes before they consider any of the existing income redistribution programs. in other words, they completely discount the leveling effect of the federal government’s massive wealth redistribution programs already in place. when you consider welfare programs, medicaid, housing assistance, education grants, disability payments, and earned income credits, the income inequality they rail about is greatly attenuated. america has made the income distribution in our country more level than at any time since the war on poverty was launched 50 years ago. progressives believe some aren’t paying their fair share. they may be right, but it’s not the 1% that are the slackers. additional text/link: “hear the inspire and ignite podcast here” read more at inspire and ignite source:

Article 3 - the free market that isn’t
the free market that isn’t (before it's news) “since 1980, the u.s. government has reduced its intervention in the u.s. economy, which has become much more of a free market. conservatives applaud this development because they think that free-market outcomes reward talent and hard work; progressives object to the income inequality of free-market outcomes and want to use government tax and transfer policy to reduce inequality.” true or false? this is a conservative framing of the story of what has happened to the u.s. economy since the early 1980s, writes university of notre dame economics professor marty wolfson in dollars & sense. it plays into the notion that conservatives are defenders of an economic system that awards success based on merit. it holds that the poor and middle classes should work to emulate—not vilify—the rich, and that those who refuse to play along and instead demand a reduction in inequality via a redistribution of wealth are parasites on a fair system. the argument, wolfson writes, “assumes that the outcomes we observe are the result of a free-market economy. however, the right-wing objective has not been to create a free market; it has been to rig government policy and the market so as to redistribute income towards large corporations and the wealthy.” humane values demand that the sum of this con game, described below, be made clear to the public that has been duped by it, and that those who can work to restore genuine fairness by changing the rules of how the

29 incredible facts which prove that poverty in america is absolutely exploding % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) did you know that the number of americans on welfare is higher than the number of americans that have full-time jobs? did you know that 1.2 million public school students in the u.s. are currently homeless? anyone that uses the term “economic recovery” to describe what is happening in the united states today is being deeply insulting to the nearly 150 million americans that are considered to be either “poor” or “low income” at this point. yes, things are great in new york city, washington d.c. and san francisco, but almost everywhere else economic conditions continue to steadily get worse. the gap between the wealthy and the poor is at a level that america has never seen before, and this is beginning to create a “robin hood mentality” that could cause a tremendous amount of social chaos in the years ahead. anger at the “haves” in america continues to rise at a very alarming pace, and the “have nots” are becoming increasingly desperate. at some point all of this anger is going to boil over, and you won’t want to be anywhere around major population centers when that happens. despite unprecedented borrowing by the federal government in recent years, and despite unprecedented money printing by the federal reserve, poverty in the united states keeps getting worse with each passing year. the following

Article 5 - the startling link between globalisation and bank fraud
the startling link between globalisation and bank fraud (before it's news) “we apologize for the inconveniences, but this is a revolution.” – subcomandate marcos, january 1, 1994 as a history buff, i recently started to re-read a book of essays from zapatista leader subcomandante marcos that i read more than 8 years ago. i was struck by the prescience of subcomandante’s essays. even when he seemed to offer no predictions for the future, more than a decade later, many of his arguments, though he offered them with mexico in mind, remain remarkably applicable to the state of the western financial world today. his following essay, “the fourth world war has begun” originally appeared in le monde diplomatique in september of 1997. it is a critically important essay because 12 years later, the intimate link that marcos speaks of between globalization and the fraud of our global banking system has now in 2010, washed upon our shores. when portuguese novelist and nobel prize winner jose saramago visited chiapas, mexico to meet with subcomandante marcos, he stated: “the issue that is being fought out in the mountains of chiapas extends beyond the frontiers of mexico. it touches the hearts of all those who have not abandoned their simple demand for equal justice for all.” here are excerpts from this important but forgotten essay below. the struggle over [

Article 6 - watch out for the cliff: which one?
by frank scott as america develops newer deadly weapons to threaten more nations with its inspired movement for humanitarian democracy through rape and murder, our economy is supposedly headed for what an ad campaign has branded “the financial cliff”. we need to either raise private taxes on a tiny minority of the 1% super rich or cut public spending on the overwhelming 99% majority. only in a nation run by people who regularly visit a proctologist to have their heads examined could this be seen as a crippling dilemma involving tough choices and necessarily shared suffering. but that’s how it’s being played by our consciousness commissars and their servants in mind management. this while the annual shopping frenzy commemorating the birth of a prince of peace – to the god of war – threatens to sink more of the 99% into greater debt for the benefit of the 1% creators of the alleged cliff over which we are all invited to plunge, on their behalf. and then we have the soon to be fulfilled mayan prophecy, accepted by some so terrified of material reality that immaterial fantasy is their only defense. beseeched souls expect the oceans to rise and the land to sink, not because of capital’s attack on nature in its pursuit of profit, but because of ancient people’s ability to forecast the distant future while they were being evolved out of existence for inability to comprehend their nearby present. we do have a deadly serious problem, recently avoided by most global representatives at a conference on the dilemmas posed by climate

Article 8 - it’s the banks, or, stop being stupid part 22
it’s the banks, or, stop being stupid part 22 (before it's news) by anna von reitz the banks control the governments, not the other way around. it has been this way for 150 years in britain, the commonwealth countries, the us, germany, most of europe, most of asia, most of africa…. and when a government tries to assert itself and make its own decisions and adopt its own currency for the benefit of its own people, as libya’s government did and as iran’s government has, it is promptly attacked by all the other governments. why? because the banks run the governments as storefront governmental services corporations, and the banks like it that way. it gives them a free hand and world dominance. they get to use the resources of the entire planet any way they please. they get to regulate and deregulate themselves in whatever way is most advantageous to them. forget the good of the people or the country they are supposed to be representing. just look at what fdr did to the virginia colony corporation when he shut it down and opened the united states, inc.? and when he bankrupted the united states of america, inc.? these were predatory corporate take-overs and mergers—- and we all paid for them. look at what the federal reserve banks did to the american states and people during the depression? the suffering and losses that the american states and people endured were enjoyed as benefits and bargains by the perpetrators of

Article 1 - leader’s visit lifts a village, yet lays bare china’s woes
but for all mr. xi’s celebrity wattage, the real manna began to rain down on luotuowan after he and his entourage left. money, quilts and pledges of government help have been pouring in from across the country. the government arranged for each household to receive $160 in cash, a bottle of cooking oil and a sack of rice, a precious commodity where corn gruel and corn cakes are often the main course. that was just the beginning. a businessman from china’s northeast was so moved by luotuowan’s suffering that he drove 500 miles with more cash and a carload of flat-screen televisions. a government work crew whitewashed the village’s stone walls, adding a band of turquoise paint for good measure. photo then came the government researchers, who were instructed to solve luotuowan’s intractable poverty, perhaps by pursuing mr. xi’s suggestion that, with outside expertise, “the people can make yellow soil into gold.” but whether the official visit by mr. xi, who was recently named communist party secretary and scheduled to be anointed president in march, will have a lasting impact on this isolated community — much less others like it — remains to be seen. the average per capita income here, about $160 a year, is less than half the official threshold for poverty, and it is a tiny fraction of the average urban income of slightly less than $4,000. most young people have long since fled for jobs

Article 2 - the inequality conundrum
countries like sweden are more equal, but to some economists, they are probably too equal. there is a rough trade-off between equality and growth: if you try too hard to make everyone equal, you get fewer entrepreneurs, fewer silicon valleys and a lower standard of living. freeman, who is generally pro-union, says sweden’s converging pay scales led to unemployment and deficits in the early ’90s, when it belatedly moved to create more incentives. similarly, gary becker, a nobel-winning economist, recalls visiting factories in communist china in 1981: the workers were all lazing around. now china has billionaires and the country is growing like topsy. you can boil down most economic policy debates — starting with hamilton versus jefferson and moving to bush versus the democrats — to this tension: how can you promote equality without killing off the genie of american prosperity? the trade-off is clear at the extremes but fuzzier in the middle. a little redistribution, cleverly designed, doesn’t hurt. one example might have occurred during the late ’90s. the stock market was crowning multimillionaires, but the poor also did a little better. among households with children, cash earnings of the poorest quintile doubled (though their earnings, at $13,000, remained meager and have tapered off more recently). most of the improvement at the bottom was because of people working more hours rather than for higher wages: a red-hot

Article 3 - efficiency and equity (in the same breath)
but even in this picture, the economy could still fall victim to a significant increase in inequality in the short term. you don't have to be a so-called bleeding-heart liberal or a low-income worker to worry about inequality. researchers have found that it creates drags on the economy that can affect everyone. after considering the white house's latest policy proposals, some top economists are making very dire predictions indeed. the shares of income controlled by the highest-earning americans are already higher than at any time since the 1920's, according to thomas piketty, a former professor of economics at m.i.t. who is now the director of studies at the école des hautes études en sciences sociales in paris. in an e-mail message last week, he predicted severe effects from the further increase in inequality posed by the white house plan. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters.

moreover, the trust problem is not a simple matter of racist natives mistrusting foreigners, since social trust is often weakest among minorities — which is one reason why the most diverse generation in american history, the millennials, is also the least trusting. so you can see the political effects of distrust even if you ignore the trump republicans entirely: it’s one reason why campus politics are so toxic, why democrats struggle to keep their diverse coalition politically engaged, and why the bernie-hillary contest produced so many cries of racism and sexism. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from op-ed columnists, the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. then linked to these ethno-cultural tensions are the tensions of class, where mass immigration favors stratification and elite self-segregation. in the united states, as in france and england, regions and cities with the largest immigrant populations are often the wealthiest and most dynamic. but this doesn’t mean that poorer regions are dying from their own xenophobia, as is sometimes suggested. the hinterlands

Article 5 - a bigger economic pie, but a smaller slice for half of the u.s.
inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade, thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by mr. piketty at the paris school of economics and mr. saez at the university of california, berkeley. but now a new administration in washington is promising to reshape the government’s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind. during his tenure in the white house, president obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance. both strategies are now targeted by president-elect donald j. trump and republicans in congress, led by house speaker paul ryan. like many conservatives, mr. ryan argues that aid to the poor is ultimately counterproductive because it undermines the incentive to work. proposals put forward by republican leaders, though short on details, make clear that they want to roll back benefits like medicaid and the affordable care act, which primarily help the poor, and direct the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest americans. about 30 percent of the country’s income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of social security checks, medicare benefits and veterans’ benefits. but until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending

Article 6 - separate and unequal
the importance of stiglitz’s contribution (and that of other dissidents) to the public debate cannot be overestimated. the news media and the congress are ill-­equipped to address the role of economic power in shaping policy. both institutions are, in fact, unaware of the extent to which they themselves are subject to the influence of money. stiglitz describes the economic capture of regulatory authorities by the interests under their jurisdiction — and the more subtle intellectual capture of policy makers of all kinds. the calculated and purposeful shaping of public discussion allowed conservative analyses to dominate debate in the years before the collapse of 2008, and in the years since they have been dominant as well. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. it is not just democratic politics that is threatened by huge disparities in wealth and income. much of stiglitz’s book is devoted to demonstrating that excessive inequality amounts to sand in the gears of capitalism, creating volatility, fueling crises, undermining productivity and retarding growth. just as discrimination results in the failure of a nation to make the best use of all its citizens, inequality, when it

Article 7 - left behind economics
i’d like to say that there’s a real dialogue taking place about the state of the u.s. economy, but the discussion leaves a lot to be desired. in general, the conversation sounds like this: bush supporter: “why doesn’t president bush get credit for a great economy? i blame liberal media bias.” informed economist: “but it’s not a great economy for most americans. many families are actually losing ground, and only a very few affluent people are doing really well.” bush supporter: “why doesn’t president bush get credit for a great economy? i blame liberal media bias.” to a large extent, this dialogue of the deaf reflects upton sinclair’s principle: it’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it. but there’s also an element of genuine incredulity. many observers, even if they acknowledge the growing concentration of income in the hands of the few, find it hard to believe that this concentration could be proceeding so rapidly as to deny most americans any gains from economic growth. advertisement continue reading the main story yet newly available data show that that’s exactly what happened in 2004. why talk about 2004, rather than more recent experience? unfortunately, data on the distribution of income arrive with a substantial lag; the full story of what happened in 2004 has only just become available, and we won’t be able to tell the full story of what’s happening right now until the last

Article 8 - when borders close
continue reading the main story the parallels between the two booms are striking. the recent advance of globalization was driven by changing technology — including container ships and the internet — and new rules that opened the world’s most populous country, china, to commerce. before 1914, steamships and the “victorian internet,” the telegraph, as well as novel rules that opened the 19th century’s largest economy, britain, to imports, drove globalization. by the eve of world war i, the world was in some ways as connected as now. measured as a share of the population, immigration to the united states was three times greater in 1914 than at any time since. advertisement continue reading the main story the social tensions generated by rapid globalization in the early 20th century also ring familiar. the share of income going to the richest 1 percent of americans rose steadily from 1870 to a peak of nearly 20 percent in the late 1920s, as global commerce created a “gilded age” plutocracy. popular resentment spread, and politicians began working to seal the borders, particularly after 1929, when the economy crashed into the great depression. america turned inward. congress passed the sweeping smoot-hawley tariff act in 1930, prompting a global trade war. measured as a share of the world economy, trade peaked at 30 percent in 1914, and fell to a low of 10 percent in 1933

Title: grounded by an income gap
Content: but where economists split is whether anything should be done about the divide. ''the question is whether you lean against the wind of the market to try to preserve decent living standards for working and poor people,'' mr. freeman said. ''europe and japan are leaning against the wind.'' many liberal economists say the united states should, too. levels of equality and inequality play a large role in people's sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their lot in life, said ronald inglehart, a sociology professor at the university of michigan, who for 30 years has been conducting something called the world values survey. ''interestingly the levels of dissatisfaction are highest in both the most equal countries in the world, the communist countries or those that have just emerged from communism, and also those with very high levels of inequality,'' he said. the only way you can achieve total equality is through coercion, he said, which makes people feel they have no control over their lives and no way to benefit from their labor. but highly unequal, extremely stratified societies, where people feel crushed by the economic power of others, breed similar dissatisfaction. conservative economists insist that the problem with the new economy is not that some people make a lot of money but a series of noneconomic factors that are holding others back. ''the problem is not inequality but poverty,'' mr. feldstein said. poor education, the breakdown of the family and what he terms ''low cognitive ability,'' together, may be responsible for holding back many of those mired in persistent poverty. he added that some poor people may choose not to work as hard as investment bankers working 70 hours a week, or to skip school, and so earn less. james heckman, a professor of economics at the university of chicago, argued: ''we have to look at some of the basic structural reasons why we have so many unskilled, poorly educated, poorly motivated people in our society. one of the most amazing phenomena of recent years is why so many people, especially minorities, have not responded to the opportunities out there. there has been a big increase in demand for skills, educated blacks have done very well, but college completion rates have leveled off.'' perhaps never before, economists say, has education been such an important factor in predicting future earnings. marvin kosters, a senior economist with the american enterprise institute, a conservative think tank in washington, said the earning advantage for those who attend college over those who do not has doubled to about 60 percent from 30 percent in the early 1970's. ''even finishing high school improves your income by about 30 percent,'' mr. heckman said. one of the biggest reasons people fail to finish school is teenage pregnancy and the strains of running a household as a single parent. ''more than 40 percent of all female-headed families with children had incomes below the poverty line,'' prof. marc l. miringoff of fordham university writes in his recent book, ''the

The articles discuss the growing issue of inequality in the US and its impact on the economy. According to Thomas Piketty, a former professor at M.I.T., the shares of income controlled by the highest-earning Americans are already higher than at any time since the 1920s.

A recent visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to a poverty-stricken village in China highlighted the issue of inequality globally. The village received significant aid and attention after the visit, but its average per capita income is less than half the official threshold for poverty.

Researchers have found that increased inequality can drag on the economy and affect everyone. A study by Piketty and José Saez at the University of California, Berkeley, showed that the concentration of wealth in the US has been increasing over time.

The articles also discuss the impact of globalization on immigration and trade. The 1914-1929 period saw a significant increase in global commerce, leading to a ""gilded age"" plutocracy and social tensions. This led to politicians working to seal borders and pass sweeping tariffs, such as the Smoot-Hawley Act.

The recent data show that the concentration of income in the US has been increasing rapidly since 2004, with the richest 1% holding nearly 20% of the wealth. The articles conclude that addressing inequality is crucial for promoting economic growth and stability.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Recent articles highlight pressing economic issues. According to Krugman and Stiglitz, austerity policies have inflicted significant damage on the economy, with many economists attributing the current state of affairs to a failure to appreciate lessons from past crises.

Income inequality is also a major concern, with some arguing that progressive taxation can help reduce it. However, others claim that income redistribution programs already in place greatly attenuate the issue.

The free market has become increasingly concentrated, with conservatives praising its ability to reward talent and hard work, while progressives object to the resulting income inequality. Economist Marty Wolfson argues that this narrative ignores the role of government policy in redistributing wealth towards large corporations and the wealthy.

Poverty in America is on the rise, with 1.2 million public school students currently homeless and nearly 150 million people considered poor or low-income. The gap between the wealthy and the poor has never been greater, leading to a ""Robin Hood mentality"" that could cause social chaos.

Globalization has also led to bank fraud, with Oxfam reporting that the richest 1% accumulated 82% of wealth created in 2017, while the poorest half saw no increase. The report highlights the need for a more equitable global economy.

In conclusion, these articles emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of economic issues and the importance of addressing income inequality, poverty, and the concentration of wealth.

Article 2 - consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews
consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews (before it's news) stocks in the consumer staples sector performed their traditional defensive role as the broader equity markets came under pressure over concerns about the prolonged weak u.s. economy and the debt crisis in europe. shares of consumer staples companies, accounting for a total of about 11.4% of the s&p 500 index, were up 5.3%, compared with a 3.3% drop for the s&p 500. in 2010, the sector index grew 10.7% versus a 12.8% increase for the s&p 500 index. the consumer staples companies are typically able to buck sluggish economic growth as food, beverage, household products and cosmetics companies that manufacture and market non-durable consumables, are considered essential to daily life, such as food, drink, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper, etc. although, staples’ earnings are expected to the continue the uptrend of the last quarters going forward, margins will remain under pressure due to elevated food prices. road ahead as referred to earlier, the macro-economic environment remains uncertain. however, we have seen that product demand has remained relatively stable for the companies that are more exposed to fast-growing emerging markets in comparison to the slow-growing developed markets. moreover, favorable foreign exchange translation and lower production costs in developing markets led to higher operating margins than the u.s. therefore, consumer staples companies have out

Article 3 - is tennessee trying to isolate its’ citizens?
is tennessee trying to isolate its’ citizens? (before it's news) i just received an email where senator lamar alexander proudly shares that he and other members of state congress have figured out how to collect taxes for online sales. in the email it states that ”for over a decade, congress has been debating how to best allow states to collect sales taxes from online retailers in a way that puts main street businesses on a level playing field with online retailers.” the bill is designed to specifically target internet sales and asks the united states congress to intervene. i have a couple of issues with this bill… first, we chose to purchase online, pay shipping and handling fees and wait for our items because of convenience. it is not cost effective for a person to get out and drive to look for one item. gas prices are ridiculous, we spend hours of time that we could enjoy with friends and family, looking for items and having to tolerate rude customer service. in addition, stores spend lots of money trying to figure out how to make us forget the purpose of our visit, so that we get sidetracked and impulse shop, thus helping us part with more of our hard earned money. so in truth, what local businesses complain is that they cannot take as much advantage of us, when we purchase online. this bill will not “level the playing field” it will make it too expensive to purchase online, so it will limit our options to in-state only. let’s say the bill passes;

Article 4 - free market defined
free market defined (before it's news) it seems that the “free market” is just about everyone’s favorite boogeyman these days, but what, exactly, is the free market? shouldn’t we at least try to define it before assigning blame? the following entry from the fortune encyclopedia of economics (time warner, 1993), david henderson, ed., pp 636-639, by murray n. rothbard should help. what is the free market? the free market is a summary term for an array of exchanges that take place in society. each exchange is undertaken as a voluntary agreement between two people or between groups of people represented by agents. these two individuals (or agents) exchange two economic goods, either tangible commodities or nontangible services. thus, when i buy a newspaper from a news dealer for fifty cents, the news dealer and i exchange two commodities: i give up fifty cents, and the news dealer gives up the newspaper. or if i work for a corporation, i exchange my labor services, in a mutually agreed way, for a monetary salary; here the corporation is represented by a manager (an agent) with the authority to hire. both parties undertake the exchange because each expects to gain from it. also, each will repeat the exchange next time (or refuse to) because his expectation has proved correct (or incorrect) in the recent past. trade, or exchange, is engaged in precisely because both parties benefit; if they did

Article 7 - who moved my juice bottle?
who moved my juice bottle? (before it's news) most people think of the capitalist marketplace as the venue for the unleashing of the human ego. selfishness reigns as those with financial means buy and build whatever they want, acquiring and amassing with no concern for the fate of anyone but themselves. bah! i can’t even imagine a more inaccurate description of real life. in fact, the opposite is true. the marketplace encourages community-mindedness like no other institution. it prods and pokes and corrects, the rich especially, all with the purpose of inspiring decision makers to leave the self and the individual ego aside and think mainly about the needs of others. by way of illustration, let me jump right in from a scene from the grocery store this morning. for more than a year, my favorite fruit juice was displayed right as you walked in the front door. there they were lined up. early-morning shoppers could grab a juice and check out in minutes. it made it all very convenient. i recall thinking, “wow, what a science it is to know where to display stuff in a store!” one might expect that these juices would be with the produce, but no. their inventory signals tell them about the existence of people like me who want to get in and get out in a hurry. juice is what we want, and we want it fast. good business! but this morning, a change rocked my world. i went to my spot at the front of the

Article 8 - black friday shopping like there is no tomorrow?
black friday shopping like there is no tomorrow? (before it's news) by tyler durden by now the broader population has been inundated with reports of what a stunning retail experience black friday was. and for those who haven’t just head over to cnbc: “sales rose an estimated 6.6 percent to a record $$11.4billion on black friday, typically the busiest shopping day of the year for americans, while the traffic at stores rose 5.1 percent, according to shoppertrak. the day’s sales growth was the strongest percentage gain since 2007, when sales rose 8.3 percent on the day after thanksgiving, said ed marcheselli, chief marketing officer at shoppertrak, which monitors retail traffic.” this is happening despite the savings rate recently dropping to pre-depressionary level, and despite revolving consumer credit (as in not cars and colleges), continuing to contract. that there is more than enough fine print will be largely irrelevant for the mainstream media which will naturally trumpet this as the next best thing to the s&p actually rising for once: “more than 120 stores at the mall of america opened at midnight. the crowd at that point was about 15,000 people. mall operators estimated that it was the largest crowd ever at the mall, which is big enough to hold seven yankee stadiums. while eager shoppers emerged from stores around the country lugging big-screen tvs and bags full of video games and toys, it was

There are no apparent contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made by the article appear to be supported by evidence.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The US coal industry's ""war on coal"" claim has been debunked by steady growth in coal mining jobs under the Obama administration. According to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, the average number of coal mining jobs increased by 15.3% compared to the Bush administration.

Meanwhile, a study found that southeastern utilities are looking to cheaper coal reserves from Wyoming's Powder River Basin and the Illinois Basin, rather than Appalachia. This has led to the decline of central Appalachian coal.

The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 aimed to connect the region to the rest of the country with massive infrastructure projects, but failed to spark an economic renaissance. A recent study found that the investment boosted incomes by only $586 per capita.

A court case in Kentucky resulted in a historic settlement between Appalachian Voices and International Coal Group, Inc., settling false reporting and water pollution violations. The settlement includes ongoing third-party auditing and stipulated fines for future violations.

Coal pollution is a major public health concern, with pollution from coal being among the top 10 causes of death and disease in the US. A physician's take on coal pollution emphasizes the importance of regulations to protect human health.

A proposed strip mine in northern Alabama was withdrawn due to concerns over toxic pollution released into the Black Warrior River, which supplies drinking water for over 200,000 residents. The mine would have released pollutants directly into the river, including just 800 feet away from a major water intake.","The articles highlight environmental concerns in Appalachia, particularly with regards to mountaintop mining. In West Virginia, a federal district court judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exceeded its authority in blocking a permit for a massive mine project, citing the Clean Water Act on their side.

In North Carolina, regulatory favoritism is alleged, as the state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources has engaged in maneuvers to protect Duke Energy from fines for water pollution. The Southern Environmental Law Center led efforts to sue Duke Energy in federal court but was pre-empted by the state agency.

Meanwhile, a plan to clean up PCBs from the Upper Hudson River is being considered, with some sources suggesting that only a fraction of the proposed dredging will occur. In West Virginia, mountaintop mining has caused immense environmental damage, and a recent ruling halted four projects citing inadequate environmental reviews.

In New York City, the Sierra Club's NYC chapter was ousted after disagreements over financial and political autonomy. The group had opposed construction of a $390 million Hudson River park project, sparking animosity with the state chapter.

Residents in Appalachian coal towns are organizing against mountaintop removal, which has buried or choked thousands of miles of streams and damaged forests.

Article 4 - appalachian coal losing another customer: competing coal reserves add to regional challenges
appalachian coal losing another customer: competing coal reserves add to regional challenges (before it's news) tva’s kingston fossil plant is one of the many coal-burning facilities in central appalachia’s front yard. yet, many plants in the southeast purchase no coal from appalachia and look to the cheaper powder river and illinois basins instead. photo from tva.com we posted a piece yesterday about the retirement plans for brayton point power station in massachusetts – the most modern coal-fired power plant in new england – and how some are calling its eventual closure a death knell for coal in the northeast. or, as jonathan peress of the conservation law foundation said in a press statement, “if [brayton point] can’t make a go of it, none of them can.” unsurprisingly, the owners of brayton point, like most other utilities that are retiring plants or converting them to burn other fuels, cited the surplus of low cost natural gas and the ongoing market transformation it has caused as major factors in coal plant closures nationwide. the fact that the nation’s natural gas boom is hastening the decline of central appalachian coal is no secret. but it leaves out any mention of the challenge from cheaper coal and competing reserves. when even southeastern utilities that operate coal plants in central appalachia’s front yard look to wyoming’s powder river basin or the illinois basin, it goes beyond the price of operating an aging plant

Article 5 - the noble, misguided plan to turn coal miners into coders: new at reason
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! even in coal’s heyday, appalachia was still relatively poor and backward. at the time, policy makers blamed its lack of economic development on mountainous inaccessibility. their solution: end the region’s isolation with massive infrastructure projects, most notably a network of four-lane highways that would connect the region to the rest of the country. so in 1965, president lyndon johnson signed the appalachian regional development act, creating the appalachian regional commission (arc). over the subsequent five decades, arc has spent $27 billion (in 2015 dollars) to build nearly 3,000 miles of the appalachian development highway system that is threaded throughout the mountains. the highways, constructed along officially designated “corridors,” are splendidly engineered—and largely empty. they utterly failed to spark an economic renaissance. despite tens of billions in federal money, the “region’s performance relative to the national average is similar to its position in the 1960s,” reported economists carl kitchens and taylor jaworski in a 2016 study published by the national bureau of economic research. they calculate that the gigantic transportation investment boosted incomes in the region by just $586 per capita. far from being discouraged by this result, policy makers are at it again. this time, they want to drag appalachia into the 21st century over newly installed information superhighways,

appalachian coal: strip mine proposal in northern alabama % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the water intake for more than 200,000 residents of birmingham, ala., is just across the river from a proposed strip mine — now withdrawn — that would have released toxic pollution directly into the river, including one discharge location a mere 800 feet away. photos courtesy of black warrior riverkeepers even to those familiar with appalachia’s historically destructive relationship with coal, the proposal for the 1,773-acre shepherd bend strip mine in northern alabama seemed unprecedented. flowing through the mountains of alabama’s largest coal-producing region, the mulberry fork tributary of the black warrior river houses the drinking water intake for more than 200,000 residents in birmingham, ala., nearly 75 percent of whom are black or african-american. just 800 feet from this intake was one of 29 outfall points where drummond company, inc., planned to release toxic mining waste directly into the waterway. drummond is no stranger to controversy. since 2002, the coal mining company has been sued at least four times regarding allegations that it hired the paramilitary gunmen responsible for the kidnap, torture and murder of unionized mine workers and their families at its colombian operations. but until recently, the company faced limited public criticism in its home state of alabama. “the proximity to a major

Article 1 - flooding in appalachia stirs outrage over a mining method
''the company and government inspectors tell us the rain's an act of god,'' said betty banks, who lives here. ''well it wasn't god who went up on our mountain with a 'dozer to leave it naked. they are destroying us here.'' ms. banks said her property had not flooded in 40 years before decapitation of the mountain. complaints from communities whose residents once earned most of their livelihoods from coal are increasing across appalachia. people resent living in the shadow and dust of mountaintop removal, with waste routinely dumped into the valleys. here, as in other back-road hamlets, people are starting to organize. they are forming a local chapter of kentuckians for the commonwealth, a nonprofit citizens' lobby that recently scored a stunning court victory against the corporate and political interests in appalachia long known as big coal. in response to complaints by kentuckians for the commonwealth about mountaintop removal on the west virginia border, judge charles haden ii of federal district court in charleston, w.va., ordered a halt last may to new mining permits. the permits had allowed hundreds of streams to be buried under rock and dirt in violation of environmental laws, judge haden said. his ruling is being appealed, and business and political leaders predict a reversal. but the lawsuit is becoming a rallying flag in the coal regions of appalachia. judge haden's name is invoked with the reverence accorded in the

Article 2 - sierra club foes battle over ouster of leaders
but both sides say the animosity between the two has deeper roots. according to carl pope, executive director of the entire sierra club, there is a long history of bad blood between the new york city group and the state chapter. ''they've had this problem for 20 years,'' he said. ''the people have changed, but they still hate each other.'' the bad feelings apparently intensified four years ago, when the city group opposed the construction of the $390 million hudson river park, despite support for it from the atlantic chapter and many other environmental groups. to moisha blechman and some of the other ousted city leaders, the sierra club as a whole has become part of the ''sellout of the environmental movement.'' the issue at stake in the latest go-around is the financial and political autonomy of the city group. with 12,000 members, the city has more than one-third of the 35,000 members in new york state. new york city's elected leadership has the power to endorse local political candidates, and it decides stances on local environmental issues. a stamp of approval from the sierra club carries considerable weight. ''it's a powerful name,'' said robert f. kennedy jr., founder and director of riverkeeper, an environmental organization that concentrates on the hudson river. ''they have huge constituencies. they're trying to run a true democracy, so it's unwieldy, like herding cats. but they can deliver

Article 3 - as the mountaintops fall, a coal town vanishes
a couple of years ago, a subsidiary of massey energy, which owns a sprawling mine operation behind and above the richmond home, bought up lindytown. many of its residents signed massey-proffered documents in which they also agreed not to sue, testify against, seek inspection of or “make adverse comment” about coal-mining operations in the vicinity. you might say that both parties were motivated. massey preferred not to have people living so close to its mountaintop mining operations. and the residents, some with area roots deep into the 19th century, preferred not to live amid a dusty industrial operation that was altering the natural world about them. so the greens sold, as did the cooks, and the workmans, and the webbs ... but quinnie richmond’s husband, lawrence — who died a few months ago, at 85 — feared that leaving the home they built in 1947 might upset his wife, who has alzheimer’s . he and his son roger, a retired coal miner who lives next door, chose instead to sign easements granting the coal company certain rights over their properties. in exchange for also agreeing not to make adverse comment, the two richmond households received $25,000 each, roger richmond recalls. “hush money,” he says, half-smiling. as mr. richmond speaks, the mining on the mountain behind him continues to transform, if not erase, the woodsy stretches he

Article 4 - regulatory favoritism in north carolina
north carolina citizens have good reason to wonder just whom their environmental regulators are trying to protect. the state’s department of environment and natural resources has engaged in a series of maneuvers that seem designed to protect the state’s largest utility, duke energy, from paying big fines for water pollution from coal ash ponds and meeting reasonable requirements that it move toxic coal ash to lined landfills away from rivers and lakes used for drinking water and recreation. meanwhile, the rest of the country — having heard of the damaging north carolina coal ash spill this month — must be wondering why the federal government has yet to move against a serious pollution problem it has known about for years. one answer is the political power of the utilities. in north carolina, a coalition of environmental groups, led by the southern environmental law center, tried three times over the past year to sue duke energy in federal court for violating the clean water act, only to be pre-empted by the state regulatory agency, which asserted its authority to protect the public through enforcement actions in state courts. once in control of the litigation, the state regulators quickly proposed a sweetheart settlement of suits against two duke energy plants. it would have imposed total fines and costs of about $99,000, a pittance for a company with operating revenues of $19.6 billion in 2012, plus a cleanup plan riddled with loopholes. critics blamed the new republican governor, pat mccrory, who had worked at duke energy for 29 years,

Article 5 - pcb cleanup may include less dredging
with a decision imminent on dredging pcb's from the upper hudson river, the bush administration is seriously considering a plan to do a fraction of the dredging that the clinton administration proposed last year, democratic elected officials and environmentalists said today. several of the people making that claim said they had heard it from people who had had contact with the office of christie whitman, the environmental protection agency administrator, who will make the decision. but none said they had learned of the plan directly from mrs. whitman's office. mrs. whitman's office did not return two calls today seeking confirmation of the plan. she said last week that she would make a decision by the end of this week, and would send it to the pataki administration for comment. ''it is our understanding that this plan is under serious consideration,'' attorney general eliot l. spitzer said. but when asked whom his sources were, he said, ''i will do everything i can not to edify you on that one.'' advertisement continue reading the main story in december, under president bill clinton, the e.p.a. proposed a clean-up plan whose centerpiece would be dredging 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river at several ''hot spots'' about 40 miles north of here. the cost, estimated at $480 million, would be charged to general electric, the company whose plants dumped polychlorinated biphenyls, or pcb's, a

Article 6 - clean water and the spruce mine
the obama administration’s decision last year to revoke a permit for a huge mine in west virginia inspired hope that mountaintop mining, which has caused immense environmental damage across appalachia, would soon be coming to an end. now a federal district court judge in the district of columbia has ruled that the environmental protection agency exceeded its legal authority in blocking the mine. the administration must appeal. the clean water act is on its side, as are the people of west virginia. mountaintop mining is a highly efficient and hugely destructive form of strip mining that blasts apart mountain ridges to expose the coal seams underneath. the resulting rubble is then dumped into the valley and streams below. thousands of miles of streams in appalachian coal country have already been obliterated in this way. the spruce no. 1 mine project in logan county, w.va., would have covered 2,278 acres and ruined six more miles of high-quality streams. it received a final permit to proceed from the army corps of engineers in 2007. lawsuits followed, and, in january 2011, the e.p.a. revoked the permit on grounds that the mine would cause unacceptable environmental damage. the e.p.a. had blocked corps projects before. but this was the first time it had rescinded an approved mining permit and was part of the administration’s broader campaign to limit mountaintop mining by reviewing old permits and tightening standards for new ones. judge amy berman jackson

Article 7 - on hudson, cleanup idea stirs emotions
but in places like schuylerville (pronounced sky-ler-vill), an old mill town about 30 miles north of albany along the most pcb-laden stretch of the hudson, the river is too big, too close, too much a part of life to be constrained by tidy answers. the region's tangled relationship with g.e., which has had a deep historic presence in this part of the state, complicates the local equation further still, as does the disdain that many people here feel for big government. many residents also fear that an aggressive dredging cleanup could repollute the river they love, and they find themselves unable to trust either side to come up with the right answer after decades of procedure and posturing and politics. ''people are definitely confused,'' said marion trieste, a schuylerville resident and environmental consultant whose front yard is dominated by a sign reading, ''clean up the hudson river.'' ms. trieste, who has been giving presentations in favor of dredging to town boards in the area, said the concerns she hears involve land as much as water, with many politicians and property owners worried that their communities could become landfill sites for contaminated bottom sludge. the e.p.a. has also alienated many local residents, ms. trieste said, with policies and procedures that can seem secretive or dictatorial. ''a lot of distrust has evolved,'' she said. for nearly 40 years, until 1977, general electric

Article 8 - mountaintop rescue
mountaintop mining is a cheap and ruthlessly efficient way to mine coal: soil and rock are scraped away by enormous machines to expose the buried coal seam, then dumped down the mountainside into the valleys and streams below. mountaintop mining has also caused appalling environmental damage in violation of the clean water act. according to a federal study, mountaintop removal has buried or choked 1,200 miles of appalachian streams and damaged hundreds of square miles of forests. no recent administration, democrat or republican, has made a serious effort to end the dumping, largely in deference to the financial influence of the coal industry and the political influence of robert byrd, west virginia’s senior senator. but the bush administration has gone out of its way to shield the practice. in 2002 and 2004, the environmental protection agency — confronted with complaints that mountaintop mining violated regulations prohibiting the dumping of mine wastes in streams — simply changed the regulations to allow it to continue. now a federal judge has inspired hopes that this destructive nonsense can be brought to a halt. in a case argued by two advocacy groups, earthjustice and the appalachian center for the economy and the environment, judge robert chambers of federal district court halted four mountaintop removal projects on the grounds that the army corps of engineers — which issued permits for the projects — had failed to demonstrate that the damage would not be irreversible. he also said the corps had failed to conduct the necessary environmental reviews. local

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The US coal industry's ""war on coal"" claim has been debunked by steady growth in coal mining jobs under the Obama administration. According to an analysis by Appalachian Voices, the average number of coal mining jobs increased by 15.3% compared to the Bush administration.

Meanwhile, a study found that southeastern utilities are looking to cheaper coal reserves from Wyoming's Powder River Basin and the Illinois Basin, rather than Appalachia. This has led to the decline of central Appalachian coal.

The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 aimed to connect the region to the rest of the country with massive infrastructure projects, but failed to spark an economic renaissance. A recent study found that the investment boosted incomes by only $586 per capita.

A court case in Kentucky resulted in a historic settlement between Appalachian Voices and International Coal Group, Inc., settling false reporting and water pollution violations. The settlement includes ongoing third-party auditing and stipulated fines for future violations.

Coal pollution is a major public health concern, with pollution from coal being among the top 10 causes of death and disease in the US. A physician's take on coal pollution emphasizes the importance of regulations to protect human health.

A proposed strip mine in northern Alabama was withdrawn due to concerns over toxic pollution released into the Black Warrior River, which supplies drinking water for over 200,000 residents. The mine would have released pollutants directly into the river, including just 800 feet away from a

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles highlight environmental concerns in Appalachia, particularly with regards to mountaintop mining. In West Virginia, a federal district court judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exceeded its authority in blocking a permit for a massive mine project, citing the Clean Water Act on their side.

In North Carolina, regulatory favoritism is alleged, as the state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources has engaged in maneuvers to protect Duke Energy from fines for water pollution. The Southern Environmental Law Center led efforts to sue Duke Energy in federal court but was pre-empted by the state agency.

Meanwhile, a plan to clean up PCBs from the Upper Hudson River is being considered, with some sources suggesting that only a fraction of the proposed dredging will occur. In West Virginia, mountaintop mining has caused immense environmental damage, and a recent ruling halted four projects citing inadequate environmental reviews.

In New York City, the Sierra Club's NYC chapter was ousted after disagreements over financial and political autonomy. The group had opposed construction of a $390 million Hudson River park project, sparking animosity with the state chapter.

Residents in Appalachian coal towns are organizing against mountaintop removal, which has buried or choked thousands of miles of streams and damaged forests. A federal judge recently halted four projects citing irreparable damage and inadequate environmental reviews.

(before it's news) …for another round — the first two were here and here — of “you know you’re in strange economic times when”… an improving economy means people are worse off “american household income dropped nearly 5 percent in economic recovery” (the raw story) research released thursday by a firm created by two former census bureau officials revealed that u.s. median household income fell almost 5 percent from june 2009, when the last economic recession was said to have ended, through june 2012. americans age 55-64 took it on the chin during the post-recession period starting in june 2009, seeing household incomes plunge nearly 10 percent, according to data produced by sentier research. younger americans ages 25-34 also saw their incomes drop by nearly 9 percent. the supply of butlers is booming “the downsizing of the american butler” (cnbc) five years ago, butler paul pearson could browse the job listings for butlers and have plenty of choices. “you could really pick the job you wanted and often negotiate the terms,” said pearson, a veteran british butler who worked for the queen of england and brooke astor. “now it’s totally different. for every position there are 10 or 20 people applying. and forget about negotiating anything. people take what they can get.” pearson likes his current job as household manager (the new term

Article 7 - this is halloween…town
i’m sure you’ve seen it. that cult classic movie halloweentown, about a town where it’s halloween all the time. no, not the nightmare before christmas. this is about a woman who’s secretly a witch and her two children. their grandmother comes to visit and they find out they have magic in the family…and then they go to halloweentown. and then there are two sequels. listen. i didn’t make it. you can probably catch it a thousand times on freeform this october, or at least once…after the harry potter weekend happening right now that is. it’s one of those movies that you either like or you hate. it’s fun if you don’t think too much about it, but it’s the claim to fame of the city it was filmed in: st. helens, oregon. each year they “transform” the city into halloweentown in their own way and people from all over come to get in on the festivities. still a problem. i was looking forward to filling up my halloweentown card and earning my commemorative coin, but since there was no shuttle bus to get my card, i couldn’t do that. this year we had a little meetup of friends there and we all took a bunch of pictures and hung out to watch the parade. we went a few years ago and were fairly disappointed, because nothing on the “schedule” was actually happening,

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Monmouth County is hosting several events this weekend. The Shore Chef Crab Cake Cook-Off will take place at Monmouth Park, featuring restaurants competing to create the best crab cake. A variety of crafters and vendors will also be present.

In other news, American household income dropped nearly 5% from June 2009 to June 2012, according to research by Sentier Research. The economy is improving, but people are worse off due to this decline in income.

The city of St. Helens, Oregon, is transforming into Halloweentown for the annual Halloween celebration. However, attendees were disappointed last year due to a lack of scheduled events.

The Eastern Shore Ballet Theatre will present its 27th annual Nutcracker performance at Wicomico High School Auditorium in December. Tickets are available online and at local dancewear stores.

Additionally, Monmouth Park will host live racing on both days of the festival, with shuttle service available for $10 round-trip from Monmouth Raceway. Ocean Avenue will be closed due to the event.

This aligns with the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, which mentions a bullish trend on the 6-hour chart and a potential bull flag forming. The article also discusses the Fed's meeting and its impact on the market, which is mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY as well. There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and the claims made by the author are supported by the analysis provided in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","The articles discuss various market trends and predictions. 

Article 1 discusses the ES futures, noting a bullish trend on the 6-hour chart and a potential bull flag forming. The author expects the market to continue higher before possibly testing the blue trendline.

Article 2 mentions the US stock market's recent performance, citing a ""melt-up"" phase. It also highlights China's credit growth slowing down and putting downward pressure on its economy.

Article 3 explores the connection between the Mayan calendar, David Wilcock, and Ben Fulford regarding an impending stock market crash. However, no concrete evidence is presented to support this claim.

Article 4 analyzes sector performance, noting that utilities have been a standout performer despite the overall market weakness. The author attributes this to defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecom.

Article 5 discusses the ES futures' recent price action, including a brief sell-off after hours and a potential bounce back before the open.

Article 6 reiterates the bullish trend on the 6-hour MACD and notes that odds favor another squeeze on the bears with higher highs.

Article 7 examines distribution in the market, noting its limited impact so far. The author expects a test of support at 88 for gold and potential reversal up if it finds support there.

Article 8 provides a morning cheat sheet for traders, highlighting favorable jobless claims reports and seasonality favoring bulls. It also mentions the importance of tight confluence between gaps and pivots in determining market direction.","Market turmoil prompts speculation on the Fed's timetable. Analysts, including Ian Shepherdson and Michael Feroli, suggest that a September rate hike is unlikely due to market expectations and economic strength.

The US presidential election has driven market sentiment, with Hillary Clinton's prospects brightening after the FBI cleared her of wrongdoing over emails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared on election eve, with all 30 components rising.

Donald Trump's shock win sparked a rally on Wall Street, with analysts attributing it to expectations of pro-business policies and public works spending. However, risks ahead include companies needing to show stronger profit and revenue growth.

Oil prices have heightened concerns, while Japan's nuclear crisis has added uncertainty. Analysts expect the market to remain event-driven, with little impetus to drive prices beyond usual risk and uncertainty.

The TSX rose on Monday, helped by energy stocks and banks, as oil prices gained and Clinton was cleared of wrongdoing. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 113.08 points, or 0.78 percent, at 14,622.33.

Overall, market sentiment remains volatile, with investors awaiting the Trump transition and its potential impact on the economy.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant. Summarize ARTICLES.

Article 1 - es morning update june 20th 2017
es morning update june 20th 2017 (before it's news) well, i was dead wrong on yesterdays’ call. i thought we’d chop in a range but the bulls decided to rip it up higher and not wait until next week i see. this morning we are looking at a 6 hour chart (not shown) that still is pointing up on its’ macd’s and a 60 minute chart that fell from a +3.5 area yesterday to around +2.0 currently, and looking like it’s about ready to turn back up again. at the same time the price level of the es futures basically traded sideways, which makes a nice bull flag. i thought we’d see a back-test of the blue trendline that the market broke-through yesterday but it’s not looking good for that to happen so far this early morning. my guess is the bull flag will play out and take the market higher first and then possibly we could see the back-test happen. while the es futures have broken out to highs from a triple top the spy has not done so. this is because of the move down last friday to account for the dividend payout, as it lost over a full point on that adjust alone. now the spy is up near a triple top but hasn’t broken through just yet. looks like 245 is the level it needs to get through to bust out like the futures did. my guess is that we’ll tag that triple top on the spy

Article 2 - can the melt-up in the us stock market continue?
can the melt-up in the us stock market continue? (before it's news) yesterday we kicked off with a bit of wry symbolism. today we’ll go for outright humour. the front page headline in the financial review reads ‘hockey: we will tax less’. seriously joe? that’s what you all say. but we’re not going to talk about the budget today. it will pop its head up tomorrow, no doubt. we’re not going to talk about china either, except to say that total credit growth for the month of april was ¥1.55 trillion, down 25% on the march figure. but it was within expectations. credit growth is still running at a hefty annual pace of 15.7%, but it’s slowing sharply. with the chinese authorities reluctant to resort to old school stimulus to boost growth, we would expect the rate of growth to continue to fall. this will put further downward pressure on china’s economy. before we move on, just a quick note to let you know we’ve made phil anderson’s speech from the world war d conference available, for free. we’ve added the first part of his speech to the anderson project (where you may have already seen his interviews with dan denning) and part two will be available from wednesday. if you’re interested in seeing what phil had to say (it’s very different to your standard daily reckoning fare), go here. meanwhile, the main us stock market indices made new all

(before it's news) the good guys, the aliens, and the bad guys all know that the stock market and the economy must crash! first, the good guys have been busy shutting down more underground bases as this latest update from david wilcock (commenting on ben fulford’s post) states… comments by david i can confirm from my own contacts that very few, if any lives were lost in the destruction of the underground bases. ben is right. this is another good proof that we’re both hearing the same things. apparently for 24 hours before there was an explosion in either case, audio recordings that have now been recovered from the bases have the sounds of massive amounts of furniture sliding across the floor and people yelling. it appears that portals were opened up in the bases and they just pulled everything out — personnel, equipment and everything in between. there is no “stuff” left in what remains. all the supplies are gone. however, where my sources disagree with ben is that they are saying there is no radioactivity. nukes were not used. instead, it was a 20-fold spontaneous increase in air pressure, after everything had been pulled out for this 24-hour period. many of the personnel working in these bases were brought in during the 1970s, and are forbidden to ever walk the surface of the earth

Article 4 - sector detector: utilities plow ahead while market takes an overdue breather
the weakness last week in u.s. stocks was entirely expected. as i mentioned in last weekend’s article, the technical condition had become quite overbought and the market was overdue to take a breather and pull back a bit. also, our sectorcast rankings had moved from bullish to a more neutral bias. and then of course, there was uncertainty created by the most serious confrontation between russia and the west since the cold war — the looming referendum in crimea to become independent from ukraine and strengthen ties with russia. thus, stocks closed friday with their biggest weekly drop in the last seven weeks. among the ten u.s. business sectors, the only sector that was up during this weak market was utilities (up about +2.4%), and other defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecom were down only nominally. also, utilities have supplanted healthcare as the leading sector year-to-date, up over +7%. the cboe market volatility index (vix), a.k.a. “fear gauge,” surged from 14.11 the prior friday — when the market set a new high — to 17.82 last friday. this is just another indication of investor trepidation ahead of the crimean referendum. to a lesser extent, the federal reserve is also on investors’ radar for this week as its fomc meeting commences on tuesday — the first with janet yellen as chairperson. the consensus view is that an additional $10 billion taper

Article 5 - es morning update june 6th 2017
es morning update june 6th 2017 (before it's news) the es futures finally sold off a little afterhours and premarket this morning. and they went right to the green rising trendline and pierced it slightly it appears. as we know the big support is down in the multi-day sideways chop zone of 2405-2415, but i doubt if it gets that low as it’s an obvious target and that’s not something the market likes to give to everyone. i’m thinking they will turn it back up shortly after the open and well go again into a sideways chop range from yesterday’s high to this mornings low. when i look again at the macd on this 60 minute chart you can see that it fell through the zero level and didn’t make the usual turn back up. this is most likely due to the 6 hour chart having its’ macd crossing over in the +5 to +6 area and putting some downward pressure on the market. looking at it i think it will take a few days to get oversold, with one of those days being today. so, by tomorrow or thursday at the latest it should be oversold enough to turn back up and support the 60 minute chart when it aligns bullish again. now while all that sounds bearish for the market it’s really just “not bullish” as price can chop sideways in a trading range for several days easily while the charts reset back to bullish. meaning i wouldn

Article 7 - distribution, finally
(before it's news) distribution has finally shown up, but so far it is only one day, so it s not time to panic yet. we are not even close to the 50dma, and the 20dema looks like it could provide a bunce here. the september high is now more likely to hold, although with 3 days nleft in the quarter, it is likely we wil get some buying as window dressing. however, the technical indicators show us the market is weakening, and with macd now crossing over, we appear to be entering a time of downward momentum. how strong it is and how long it lasts is unknown. i would not be surprised to see a test of the 5odma, but i would be surprised to see it this week. whoever triggered thee flash crash in oil last week might have known something: it was no flash in the pan, but the start of another down move. we now no longer have moving averages as support: instead, they are now resistance again. it seems likely to me that we are headed for a test of support at 88. gold is hanging tight, although macd is now moving down. tha does not necessarily mean a big move down, but a move down is likely. the yield on the 10 year is also moving down, but nowhere near the previous low, which should be support. there is a chance it will find support here: if so, look for a sudden reversal up in the

Article 1 - market turmoil prompts new speculation on the fed’s timetable
“normalization could become more compelling by the time of the meeting as we get additional information on how the u.s. economy is performing and more information on international and financial market developments, all of which are important in shaping the u.s. economic outlook,” mr. dudley said. for all the hedging in mr. dudley’s comments, some analysts saw them as confirmation the fed is unlikely to move at its meeting next month, scheduled for sept. 16 and 17. market-based measures of investor expectations, which have fallen alongside the stock market, already put the odds of a september rate increase at just 24 percent wednesday. video “the odds of a september rate hike have just dropped further, and we have to push our forecast for the first move to december,” ian shepherdson, chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics, told clients wednesday afternoon. “a massive payroll number next week, coupled with strength in august auto sales, retail sales and the ism surveys, could yet persuade the fed to move, but markets would have to rebound significantly too, and this all seems a bit too much to ask.” but michael feroli, chief united states economist at jpmorgan chase, said in an email on wednesday that he still saw a real chance for a september increase, provided markets behaved and the domestic economy continued to show strength. “i do think he left the door open to september just a tad, which makes sense given that markets and

Article 5 - weighing the week ahead: possible stimulus and how to pay | investing.com
it is a short week without much new data. even fedspeak is on holiday. the big story will continue to be the trump transition. i expect the punditry to be asking a dual question: how much economic stimulus and how to pay? last week once again, last week’s economic news was nearly all good, but not the focus of discussion. theme recap in my last wtwa, i predicted that it would be “all trump, all of the time”. and so it was. speculation about the effect of trump policies is rampant, usually wrong, and revised daily. this is profitable for media sources and the punditry, so we can expect it to continue. the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from doug short . he captures the continuing rally as well as the late-week weakness (despite options expiration). spx chart doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information. his charts save more than a thousand words! read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long-term perspective. the news each week i break down events into good and bad. often there is an “ugly” and on rare occasion something very positive. my working definition of “good” has two components. the news must be market friendly and better than expectations. i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news – and you should, too! this week’s news was quite

Article 7 - analysts say trump stocks rally could persist
new york (afp) - donald trump's shock win of the us presidency sparked a surprising rally on wall street this week that some believe could be a prelude to further gains. the response, which sent the dow jones industrial record to all time highs on thursday and friday, reflected expectations that pro-business policies and ramped-up public works spending would spur greater economic growth. traders also shrugged off the worries many talked about prior to the election, including questions about the republican mogul's temperament and his protectionist trade policies. analysts said the market's optimistic response was reasonable, but that there are also risks ahead. ""there's a lot of expectations built into this rally,"" said jack ablin, chief investment officer at bmo private bank. but he said that for stocks to go higher, companies will have to show much stronger profit and revenue growth. the dow had its best week in five years, ending friday at 18,847.66, to take its gain since january above 8 percent. the broader s&p 500, pulled down by energy stocks, was still about 1 percent below its all-time high. that was a far cry from the cataclysmic reaction to a trump upset that some analysts predicted. ""i expected a brexit-like pullback on an unlikely trump victory because i felt that selling would be fuelled by emotion,"" ablin said. ""it seems that just opposite type of emotion may be behind some of the buying."" analysts attributed

Article 8 - after gaining for 3 days, shares slip on oil worries
stocks on wall street edged lower tuesday, reversing three consecutive trading days of advances amid concerns over oil prices and japan’s nuclear crisis. the insurrection in libya and the problems at the damaged nuclear reactors in japan have heightened the sense of uncertainty about oil prices. on tuesday, a report of a surge in inflation in britain added to expectations of higher rates in europe. but as the three main indexes remained generally lower or flat, analysts said there was little impetus to drive the markets beyond the usual risk and uncertainty that investors have become accustomed to lately. “we have seen a couple of very strong days, and it is not surprising it is a flat day as investors reconsider the bounceback we have seen,” said kate warne, an investment strategist for edward jones. advertisement continue reading the main story “we are getting a very event-driven market,” she added. “it is a catch-your-breath, or wait-and-see day without a lot of market moving news.”

Title: es morning update july 5th 2017
Content: es morning update july 5th 2017 (before it's news) i hope everyone had a great 4th of july. now it’s back to business. there’s an fomc meeting today but it’s just the minutes from the prior meeting. still though, many traders put off trades until it’s over with as they think something new might be said. so we could have a slow morning while we wait for that 2pm est period to arrive. chartwise we are trapped in a falling channel of sorts. resistance is right above from the green rising trendline and the black falling trendline. the macd’s are making lower highs on each rally attempt and are just a hair above the zero line right now, but look weak like they could rollover anytime. logically it’s more likely to rollover before the meeting as the “unknown” scares traders. however, there’s still another light volume day expected and most bearish setups don’t play out from what i’ve noticed. so i’d be more into believing that we’ll just trend sideways to up with small pullback bought. after the meeting and nothing changes the charts should be back to normal. what is normal these days though? normal is whatever the fed’s want the market to do i guess. and that’s “go up” 99% of the time in my opinion. then once in a blue moon they flash crash it. speaking of flash crashes they a big one yesterday on amazon, apple, microsoft and google (article is re-posted on my blog). a friend told me the qqq’s actually showed a print of 67 on them too! talk about a crash, now that’s a crash. of course they just call this a “data glitch” but we “red pill takers” know there’s a code in those numbers for the future price of those stocks and the nasdaq, which means a crash is coming at some point… but the “when” part is unknown. anyway, back to the market for today and the rest of this week. i’m expecting more light volume, which suggests more upside then downside. there’s an “inverted head and shoulders” pattern there too, which is bullish of course. and when you add in the new rising trendline in reddish pink you’ll see we are also in a triangle… and near the apex where breakouts or breakdowns happen. so if the fed’s don’t say anything bad i have to side with the bulls and expect another run higher versus a breakdown to retest the 6/29 lows. but i still think the bulls are running out of time and a top this month is likely. august through october are bear months and with these new fp’s put out yesterday there’s certainly a coded message of something bad yet to come. source: http://reddragonleo.com/2017/07/05/es-morning-update-july-5th-2017/

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Market turmoil prompts speculation on the Fed's timetable. Analysts, including Ian Shepherdson and Michael Feroli, suggest that a September rate hike is unlikely due to market expectations and economic strength.

The US presidential election has driven market sentiment, with Hillary Clinton's prospects brightening after the FBI cleared her of wrongdoing over emails. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared on election eve, with all 30 components rising.

Donald Trump's shock win sparked a rally on Wall Street, with analysts attributing it to expectations of pro-business policies and public works spending. However, risks ahead include companies needing to show stronger profit and revenue growth.

Oil prices have heightened concerns, while Japan's nuclear crisis has added uncertainty. Analysts expect the market to remain event-driven, with little impetus to drive prices beyond usual risk and uncertainty.

The TSX rose on Monday, helped by energy stocks and banks, as oil prices gained and Clinton was cleared of wrongdoing. The S&P/TSX Composite Index was up 113.08 points, or 0.78 percent, at 14,622.33.

Overall, market sentiment remains volatile, with investors awaiting the Trump transition and its potential impact on the economy.

treehouse foods down 13% after reporting poor sales volumes % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) shares of treehouse foods (nyse: ths) are down nearly 13% after the company reported poor sales volumes. the company announced that lower-than-anticipated december sales volumes will result in fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be between $$0.84 to $$0.87 per fully diluted share, representing a 7% increase compared to $$0.80 per fully diluted shares for the 2010 fourth quarter. the company’s fourth quarter retail channel volumes decreased 4%, mainly due to an 8% decline in december volumes, well below historical levels. as a result, the company’s 2011 full year adjusted earnings are now expected to be between $$2.70 and $$2.73 per fully diluted share compared to the company’s previously-issued guidance of $$2.90 to $$3.00 per fully diluted share. the company believes the volume decline was driven by three main factors: 1) reduction in consumer food purchases, 2) sales shift away from traditional grocery customers toward alternate channel retailers, 3) negative effect of warm weather in the midwest and northeast on seasonal sales.

Article 3 - how far into darkness will the world fall?
how far into darkness will the world fall? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! phillip j. watt, contributor waking times humanity has come to significant point in its history. we are on the precipice of a serious economic disaster, a system-blowing transformation, or both. even if a fiat-debt implosion occurred of an unprecedented magnitude, we do have the solutions and capacity to respond in a way that will minimize the impacts and transform our reality into something better. it will take some serious people power though, so, will we choose to act before this happens, or will we wait until the masses are subject to further suffering? not that this isn’t happening already. the middle class is eroding, millions can’t afford to feed themselves, many people are underemployed or working multiple part-time jobs and barely scraping through, and those subject to poverty, homelessness and other disadvantage is increasing. social unrest is manifesting as a result. more and more people are being inflicted with this pain which has propelled the wave of support for the far left us representative, sanders, and the far right representative, trump. on the other hand, clinton is obviously a face of the status quo and that is clear as day for anyone who has any idea about how the corporate oligarchy works. yet the divide between the supporters of trump and sanders is frighteningly counter-productive; if they actually united and together stood against the crony capitalists, socialism

Article 4 - on the road to world war iii
on the road to world war iii (before it's news) the new world order is a diabolical plan developed by the financial elite as a way to ruin the national sovereignty of the governments of the world through economic blackmail and world conflict with the objective of enslaving humankind in a one world fascist dictatorship / government. the agents of the new world order have effectively obtained control of the world’s financial system. our politicians have made it “legal” for the private banking corporations to manipulate our money supply, stock market and inevitably our destiny. a famous quote “money is the root of all evil” is fitting, but a greater understanding comes when you ask the question “what is the root of all money?”. the private banking corporations manipulate the printing press and print money for the price of paper (usury) and utilize it to enslave the nations and people of the world in financial debt. our governments have become completely insolvent or bankrupt through the construction of this financial debt slavery. our governments are now maxing out the nwo credit line to keep the game going. we, the people are the only resources keeping the system alive as we are deceitfully sold into slavery at birth to the financial market as property of the state. our productive power or labor via the income tax is utilized as equity for this debt slavery. matrix-esque anyone? given that the agents of the nwo manipulate the economy, our governments are slaves to the economic structure. the nwo utilizes this power to control

Article 5 - the descent into stasis
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! last weeks’ post attempted, with the help of the ancient greek philosopher polybius, to trace out the trajectory that democracies—and in particular the united states—tend to follow across time. the pattern that polybius outlined, and that american politics has cycled through three times so far in the course of its history, begins with most of the nation’s political power concentrated in a single person, and follows the diffusion of power to the point that the entire political system settles into a gridlock only a massive crisis can break. just now, according to that model, we are in the stage of gridlock, and thus of maximum diffusion of power. now of course this interpretation flies in the face of the standard narrative that surrounds power in america today. both sides of the political spectrum these days like to insist that too much power is in the hands of the other side, at least when the other side is in the white house or has a majority in congress. the further from the mainstream you go, the more strident the voices you’ll hear insisting that some small group or other has seized absolute power over the us political system and is running things for their own advantage. the identity of the small group in question varies wildly—it’s hard to think of anyone who hasn’t been accused, at some point in the last half century or so, of being the secret elite that runs everything—but the theory that some small

Article 6 - state-owned banks end wall st. fraud with competent citizenry (video)
state-owned banks end wall st. fraud with competent citizenry (video) (before it's news) carl herman, contributing writer activist post the us suffers from debt-damned economics: a robber baron-era paradigm whereby the harder americans work, the more in debt we collectively descend. the reason is orwellian confusion between “money” (which the us does not create and use to facilitate trade) and “debt/credit” (which our government says is “money” and what is created). our modern-day robber baron/oligarchs maintain this confusion with the willing help of us corporate media. so, what do competent citizens do to stop transferring literally trillions of dollars of benefits every year from working americans to these parasitic oligarchs? with competent citizenry that understands, demands, and holds our group work (government) accountable for transparency, i recommend two concurrent strategies: 1. unleash tens of thousands of state and city legislators on the idea that under current laws and regulations, they can form their own banks. the benefit is at-cost credit instead of current borrowing costs. for example, california would save ~$$5 billion in interest costs every year with at-cost credit (this would re-hire 20,000 laid-off teachers at $$70,000/year and still have $$1.6 billion left-over). at-cost credit could also mean at-cost public mortgages (think 1-2% interest rate). the one state with the

Article 7 - hear that? it’s the sound of the door closing for americans
hear that? it’s the sound of the door closing for americans (before it's news) we hate being right. after all, we have been predicting that people in the us and most of the western world will soon find themselves living in a terminator-esque world where they will be tracked every moment of the day (us government builds world’s biggest domestic spy complex), the us government can jail indefinitely and even kill its own citizens (ndaa bill can send americans to prison indefinitely without trial), that the assets of westerners will be taken and consumed by their vampire overlords (france mulls 100% tax rate), they will be restricted in their ability to travel outside the country (congress about to pass a bill that restricts travel and revokes passports with no trial) and it will be impossible to get your money outside of the country to protect it from confiscation (capital controls). on the topic of capital controls we had predicted what is now happening. we’ve been writing about it for some time (see “the door is about to shut for americans” in may of last year). the only thing that has surprised us is the speed in which it is all happening. we are rarely shocked but we have been surprised at the speed with which the world’s banks have stopped accepting us citizens as clients. it was only a few weeks ago that we penned, “international banking options for americans closing down fast” and stated that our sources had notified us of at least

Article 1 - even in recession, spend they must: luxury shoppers anonymous
“people are saying: ‘it’s that time of year; i want to buy something, but i feel a little weird,’ ” ms. goldberg said. “often they tell me, ‘i don’t want to be out there making an announcement with a big bag that says harry winston.’ ” private dealers, many of them dilettantes who acquire their wares from designer friends, at trade shows and from dealers and artisans in exotic locales, are the bane of recession-battered high-end merchants. established retailers are hard pressed to compete with such luxury pop-up shops while maintaining inventories and absorbing the high costs of operating their businesses. but under-the-radar parties offer the well heeled, and the well connected, a chance to snap up temptations without an inner censor chiding them for their spendthrift ways. photo “there is certainly a stigma to spending openly in this economy,” said eric spangenberg, a consumer psychologist and the dean of the business school at washington state university. “these people don’t want to appear flippant by disregarding the woes of the economy,” he said, “but they still want to get their shop on, and they’re going to find a way.” those who cannot wean themselves off the shopping habit flock to events that are, in dr. spangenberg’s phrase, “the high-end equivalent of a tupperware party.” there they trade gossip and air kisses — and spring for crewelwork

Article 2 - it’s not so easy being less rich
the wealthy don’t generally speak publicly about their finances, in good times or bad. it’s in poor taste, for one, and their employers could fire them for talking even a little. but people who provide services to the wealthy — lawyers, art advisers, personal trainers and hairstylists — say they are getting an earful about their clients’ financial anxieties. interviews with the people who actually see the bank statements, like divorce lawyers and lenders, say their clients are definitely living on less than they did a year ago, regardless of how expansive the definition of “less” may be. hairstylists and private jet rental companies say the wealthy are cutting back on luxuries like $350 highlights and $10,000-an-hour jet rentals. even nutritionists and personal trainers notice a problem. the wealthy are eating more and gaining weight because of the stress. these financial problems — if they can be called that — will hardly elicit tears from the rest of us. but in those gilded living rooms, there is a quiet nervousness about keeping up appearances. photo “even if they’re not in danger of not paying their mortgage, there’s still a psychological change,” said chris del gatto, chief executive of circa, which has watched its business jump by 50 percent in the last year as wealthy clients sell their spare diamonds and rolexes. “the economy is an issue even for people who don’t need the money.” their spouses could leave them when they discover that their

Article 3 - retirement, the federal way; workers for u.s. invest part of their nest eggs. the results vary.
president bush holds up the federal savings program as a model for the retirement accounts he wants to add to social security. he is counting on those accounts to earn enough to offset the cuts that his plan calls for in the current fixed social security pensions. the federal thrift plan, however, differs in an essential way from the retirement accounts that the president wants to carve out of social security. the thrift accounts are on top of a generous fixed pension for federal employees, while president bush's proposal envisions the accounts replacing a substantial part of social security's fixed pension. the thrift system functions like a 401(k)-type plan. each of the five funds in the plan has done well enough to meet president bush's minimum goal of an average annual return of 3 percent, adjusted for inflation. over the 18-year life of the plan, even the most conservative fund, invested in treasury bonds, has returned, on average, 6.6 percent annually before inflation, partly because the fees are kept below what wall street charges. (that compares with an annual inflation rate in that period of nearly 3 percent.) near the high end, a fund that tracks the standard & poor's 500-stock index had an average return of 12 percent a year. the last 18 years, however, are not a template for the future. nor do the performances of the five funds mirror the actual experiences of individual investors. whether a federal employee can earn more than mr. bush's inflation-adjusted 

Article 4 - the pope's ecological vow
francis also made a point — highly unusually — of referencing the pioneering eco-theology of the orthodox church, as well as citing no fewer than 18 teaching documents from catholic bishops’ conferences around the world. all this demonstrated his acute awareness of the importance of alliance-building on such a major issue. you are not, he was telling critics, dealing with just one man here. he took similar care over the science. the pope should stick to religion and leave science to the scientists, said one conservative, the republican presidential candidate rick santorum, in one of a wave of “prebuttal” remarks as the encyclical was being finalized. that is exactly what francis did in accepting the view of the 97 percent of actively-publishing climate scientists who say human activity is a major contributor to global warming. the pope’s political acumen was also clear from the way he timed the encyclical to target the three united nations summits on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later this year. but there is something more profoundly subversive about laudato si’ than what it says on climate change. on the day it was published, the pope privately told his closest advisers in rome that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all. global warming is merely a symptom of a deeper malaise. the real problem, he insists, is the myopic mentality that has failed to address climate change to date. the rich world’s indifference to the

Article 5 - thinking less about money
this week, our contributors, along with some of our favorite sources, are writing about their new year's financial resolutions. this post is from bucks artist in residence carl richards. my no. 1 financial goal for 2011 is to stop thinking about money so much. i realize that may sound funny coming from someone who thinks and writes about money for living, so let me explain. it's important for me to recognize that i'm not immune to financial mistakes just because i spend a lot of time studying, writing and giving advice about money. in fact, i've made a number of errors over the last five years that i regret. one of my major goals for the coming year is to be very clear about those mistakes and what led to them. then, i want to practice radical self-awareness so i'm as open and authentic as possible about my own financial life. often when i think about money, it's either in terms of the past and the mistakes that i've made or the future and the things that worry me. both of them take me away from focusing on the present. one of the things i want to do better in 2011 is to move on and not spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about things i could or should have done differently. of course, i want to use those experiences to help myself and others avoid similar mistakes, but i want to do it in a way that doesn't involve blame or shame. i have a tendency,

Article 6 - dangers of too much comfort
change can be a scary thing. so it's no wonder that we're drawn to things we recognize -- to things that are familiar -- and stick with them. it's why we go to a chain restaurant, buy clothes from the gap and drive the same kind of car for big chunks of our lives. it's human to look for the familiar and to keep coming back. but when it comes to investing and money, this pattern creates some problematic biases. let's take a look at how they might be impacting your life. 1. paying every month each month there are certain bills that we get in the habit of paying without really thinking about them. some, like our utilities and mortgage, are a given. but what about that gym membership? we're even more oblivious to the bills that get paid automatically. over time, we can end up spending more money than we'd like on things we don't really want and maybe aren't even using. but we do it because we always have, and we haven't stopped to ask why. a new month starts on tuesday. i suggest you sit down and make a list of all your monthly bills. then go through each one and ask the question: do i really need this? 2. believing in the company secretaries becoming millionaires because they own a bunch of company stock are the exception, not the norm. so don't kid yourself that working for a company, having a 401(k) with that company and investing the rest

Article 7 - how giving became cool
turner’s gift helped change that culture, reviving the tradition of great philanthropists like rockefeller and carnegie. turner publicly began needling other billionaires — including bill gates and warren buffett — to be more generous. that was a breach of etiquette, but it worked. “it’s a starting point for me of this modern era of high-profile big public giving,” reflected matthew bishop, co-author of “philanthrocapitalism,” a terrific book about how the business world is reshaping philanthropy. “he called on others to step up, which did have a crystallizing effect on others. it allowed journalists and others who were talking to bill gates to say: ‘why aren’t you giving more?’ ” then they tormented buffett with the same question. ultimately, gates and buffett made huge contributions that are transforming the struggle against global disease and poverty. my hunch is that gates will be remembered less for his work on personal computers than for his accomplishments against malaria , aids and poverty itself. photo gates and buffett are both now recruiters for the giving pledge, which commits zillionaires to give away at least half their wealth. the giving pledge adds to the expectation that those who have won the global jackpot should give something back. turner channeled his money through the united nations foundation, where it was leveraged to get other contributions so as to bring $2 billion to finance causes from malaria to polio , from climate change to family

Article 8 - net worth, self-worth and how we look at money
those who are in the money avoidance camp share beliefs that make them distance themselves from money. mr. klontz said this group may be worried about abusing credit cards. they may believe that they do not deserve to have money and may sabotage their own financial well-being. people in this group tend to have low incomes and net worth. they also tend to be younger. people who fall into the money worship camp would seem to be the opposite, but their behaviors are equally destructive. they believe that an increase in income or a windfall will make everything better and love the status derived from the things that money can buy. this belief also lands people in debt because they use whatever credit they have to buy things that will impress others. “they believe money will solve all of your problems,” mr. klontz said. “this is the money belief pattern that afflicts the majority of americans.” anxiety about money status occurs when people’s self-worth is linked to their net worth. these people often take bigger financial risks because they want to have the stories of big gains to impress their friends. (don’t expect them to tell you when those big bets do not pay off.) the only affliction that did not have an overwhelmingly negative impact on people’s financial future was money vigilance. people with this disorder do not like to share information about their income or wealth, but they also do not spend foolishly. still, excessive wariness about spending can keep these people from enjoying the benefits of

The article also makes unsubstantiated claims about the US and EU imposing sanctions on Russia and the European Union extending economic sanctions in December.

* Crimeans overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in March 2014.

**US-Backed Regime Assaults Eastern Ukraine**

* The Ukrainian government, backed by the US and EU, launched an offensive against pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine.
* Mass graves have been found in Slavyansk, a former opposition stronghold.
* The US and EU imposed sanctions on Russia to compel it to abandon support for opposition militias.

* Western markets seemed unaffected by escalating tensions between Russia and Europe/US.
* The juxtaposition of calm markets with escalating tensions created a cognitive dissonance.

**Realpolitik in Ukraine**

* US and EU policy towards Ukraine was seen as motivated by hope and wishful thinking, rather than realism and experience.

**EU Suspends Financial Cooperation with Russia**

* The European Union suspended financial cooperation with Russia due to its incoherent performance in the Ukrainian crisis.
* The EU expanded sanctions against Russian entities threatening Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The US and Russia have agreed to a pact to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine. The agreement was reached during Geneva talks involving US Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Ukrainian Acting Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia, and EU Representative Catherine Ashton.

However, the agreement does not require Russia to remove its troops from Ukraine's border or commit to direct talks with the interim Ukrainian government. The European Union is likely to extend economic sanctions on Russia over Ukraine in December, but may be harder to renew if Donald Trump becomes US President.

The US has proposed arming Ukraine with anti-tank missiles and other arms, which could escalate tensions with Russia. Germany and France have invited Ukraine and Russia to meet for four-way talks on November 29 to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

President Barack Obama is facing pressure from Senator John McCain to take a stronger stance against Syria, Iran, and Russia. Obama must find the courage to correct his administration's narrative on Ukraine and cooperate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve world peace.

The situation remains tense, with fighting between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists continuing in eastern Ukraine. The US is developing plans for actions that would escalate over time if Russia continues to support the separatists.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 4 - countdown to war: the coming u.s.-russia conflict
(before it's news) the united states and russia may be unwittingly stumbling down a path to deeper confrontation and even war, cautioned two prominent american national-security experts at a panel in washington, d.c. tuesday. graham allison, director of harvard university’s belfer center for science and international affairs, and dimitri k. simes, president of the center for the national interest and publisher of this magazine, suggested that while leaders in both countries may not intend to escalate their disagreements on matters like the ukraine crisis, poorly structured decision processes, opposing goals and divergent narratives can still produce conflict. “even as they state that they don’t want a confrontation—with full conviction,” said simes, “they are seeking a victory without war…both sides show little inclination to compromise on what they consider to be fundamental and what they believe they are entitled to.” worse, warned allison, russia may believe that the use of threats and military force will produce the best outcomes in a serious confrontation with the west. “russia has escalation dominance,” said allison, and “from a russian point of view,” shaping the confrontation in such a way “sends a very powerful message, especially to the europeans.” allison and simes suggested that a diplomatic resolution is still very possible—“we are not predicting world war three,” in simes’ words—but that “this is not [a] time in the u.s.-russian relationship when you

Article 7 - eu suspends financial cooperation with russia
(before it's news) new american round of sanctions is enhanced by the european council’s decision to impose restrictive measure against moscow. the leaders of the european union agreed today to suspend financial cooperation with russia. this action imposes restrictions on the european investment bank (eib) and european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd), to cooperate with moscow due to what the europeans understand as russia’s incoherent performance in the ukrainian crisis. heads of state and government also decided to expand a community-wide legal basis for its sanctions to reach a larger range of entities that threaten the integrity of ukraine, diplomatic sources explained. the twenty-eight members made ​​these decisions during an extraordinary summit dedicated to nominate candidates for the top positions of the institutions of the eu, which also deals with international issues. the european council in its conclusions regretted that the requirements it demanded from russia had not been met, even though according to its members, they could have helped difuse tensions with ukraine. therefore, they agreed to “expand the restrictive measures directed against institutions, including the russian federation, in ways that affect the country materially and financially. the eu now considers russia’s behavior as actions that undermine and threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of ukraine. eu members urged the foreign ministers of the union, which will meet in brussels on tuesday, to prepare the legal documents required for this purpose, so that the measure is effective. the meeting also agreed to

Article 8 - the internet post
behind closed doors the u.s. government is giving russia free military equipment—also used to train american troops—even after president obama announced punitive sanctions against moscow and, more importantly, a suspension in military engagement over the invasion and occupation of ukraine. the secret operation was exposed this week by members of congress that discovered it in the process of reviewing the fiscal year 2014 budget and the proposed fiscal year 2015 budget request. it turns out that the national nuclear security administration (nnsa) has been providing the russian federation with the multiple integrated laser engagement system (miles), the federal legislators say. the u.s. military uses miles for tactical force-on-force training because it has a system of lasers and dummy ammunition to simulate ground combat. it’s a crucial, military-grade technology that’s similar to a “laser tag” available in some commercial markets, according to one of the outraged lawmakers (oklahoma republican jim bridenstine) that helped uncover the scandal. bridenstine, a member of the house armed services committee, has joined forces with ohio republican mike turner, chairman of the house subcommittee on tactical air and land forces, to demand an end to the program. along with about a dozen other house colleagues they penned a letter to energy secretary ernest moniz, who oversees the agency carrying out the “irresponsible military equipment transfers” to russia. the obama administration’s planned supply to the russian federation is a grave mistake

vasili domashev, who described himself as an aide to the commandant of a building under occupation in donetsk, said that since no representative of the newly declared and wholly unrecognized people’s republic of donetsk had been invited to the geneva talks, the republic would not be bound by the decisions made there. though western governments maintain that russia holds sway over the groups here, mr. domashev said that was not the case. “lavrov and kerry decided, but who are they to us? we are the donetsk republic. we have people who make their own decisions.” “we will not leave,” he concluded. “we do not trust kiev. we really don’t trust them.” the agreement, described in a joint statement, does not specifically require russia to remove the approximately 40,000 troops it has on ukraine’s border, as mr. obama has demanded. nor does it commit russia to holding direct talks with the interim ukrainian government, which has been another american demand. the agreement also does not mention the russian annexation of ukraine’s crimea peninsula last month. the agreement on “initial concrete steps to de-escalate tensions and restore security” in ukraine followed more than six hours of talks here that involved mr. kerry, his russian counterpart, sergey v. lavrov, ukraine’s acting foreign minister, andrii deshchytsia, and catherine ashton, the

Article 2 - eu set to extend russia sanctions, but may be harder when trump president - business insider
republican presidential nominee donald trump is introduced by u.s. senator jeff sessions at the ""retired american warriors"" conference during a campaign stop in herndon thomson reuters by gabriela baczynska brussels (reuters) - the european union is likely to extend economic sanctions on russia over ukraine in december but could find it much harder to renew them in the future if donald trump succeeds in warming up relations with russia. trump, who will take over as u.s. president in january, has said he wants a ""good relationship"" with russia and president vladimir putin, alarming some in the eu who fear a policy shift that softens the u.s. stance on the ukraine crisis. the sanctions were first imposed shortly after russia annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014 and rolled over for six-month periods since then. five european diplomats told reuters they expected eu leaders to extend the main economic sanctions in brussels next month -- before trump takes office. the decision requires unanimity among the 28 member states and the economic sanctions are now in place until the late january, 2017. ""the roll-over in december should still happen. there is no change on the ground in ukraine ... there is really no argument not to extend them,"" said a european diplomat. ""but then, after trump's inauguration, who knows where he takes us. it may become way

Article 3 - many at u.n. seek evidence for u.s. case against iraq
in the background is the bush administration's policy of ''regime change.'' the notion is anathema to many at the united nations, who see it as smacking of the american arrogance of the cold war, when washington sponsored coups to unseat governments it did not like. respect for the sovereignty of other nations, even the less savory ones, is a core operating principle of the world organization. the administration policy ''collides with the role of the united nations,'' said a senior diplomat from a security council member that could be an important swing vote. but he added that he was open to hearing mr. bush's arguments. ''the united states does not have a weak case,'' the diplomat said. ''but the united states first has to prove its case, that iraq has weapons of mass destruction and the intention to use them in an imminent attack.'' the urgency of the need for action against mr. hussein is a matter dividing many nations from washington. if mr. bush shows evidence that iraq is working busily to build a nuclear weapon and is becoming an immediate danger, quite a few nations might consider supporting military action against him. but many countries are concerned that the bush administration wants to drag them into a first strike against baghdad on the vaguer ground that mr. hussein might become a nuclear threat some time in the future. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter

Article 4 - no easy way out of ukraine crisis
while secretary of state john kerry visited kiev on tuesday to show support for its beleaguered pro-western government, mr. obama consulted with chancellor angela merkel of germany by telephone about finding a face-saving way for mr. putin to withdraw in favor of international monitors. speaking with reporters, mr. obama said some had interpreted mr. putin’s remarks earlier in the day to mean he “is pausing for a moment and reflecting on what’s happened.” others cautioned against reading too much into mr. putin’s statements. “it would be a mistake on our part to look at what he’s saying and think this crisis is almost over: ‘o.k., we’ve lost crimea, but the rest of the country is with us,’ ” said ivo daalder, mr. obama’s first ambassador to nato and now president of the chicago council on global affairs. he said crimea would become a precedent: “crimea is a big deal. it means a country can be invaded, and a big piece of it can be taken away with no price. but two, this isn’t just about crimea. this is about who is ultimately in control of ukraine.” the situation remained tense, as obama administration officials moved forward with plans for sanctions that could be imposed by the united states and, they hoped, in conjunction with european allies. the administration is developing plans for actions that would escalate over time if russia continued

Article 5 - pentagon and state department said to propose arming ukraine
photo washington — the pentagon and state department have proposed to the white house a plan to supply ukraine with anti-tank missiles and other arms, according to defense department officials. the proposed transfer — which also would include antiaircraft arms that would be defined as defensive weaponry — comes as fighting between ukrainian troops and russian-backed separatists has increased in recent days, and the united states is taking steps to deter aggressive military actions by moscow. the plan by the pentagon and state department has been presented to the white house, but no decision has been made, said a defense department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a proposal still under review. it was not clear if president trump had been briefed on the proposal. whether to provide more substantial weaponry to kiev’s beleaguered forces has embroiled american policy makers for several years. advertisement continue reading the main story two years ago, eight former senior american officials urged the obama administration to send $3 billion in defensive arms and equipment to ukraine, including anti-armor missiles, reconnaissance drones, armored humvees and radars that can determine the location of enemy rocket and artillery fire.

Article 6 - germany, france seek four-way talks on eastern ukraine conflict on november 29
berlin/kiev (reuters) - germany and france have invited ukraine and russia to meet in minsk next week for four-way talks aimed at kick-starting peace talks on the crisis in eastern ukraine, german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday. steinmeier said he hoped the foreign ministers from all four countries could meet next tuesday, weeks before u.s. president-elect donald trump is due to take office. ""even if we don't manage to find the big solution for the crisis, talks like these are simply necessary to make sure the situation doesn't get out of control,"" steinmeier told parliament. it remains unclear how trump, who has promised to improve ties with russia, will respond to continued fighting between ukrainian troops and russian-backed separatists. interfax ukraine quoted foreign minister pavlo klimkin as saying he had spoken with steinmeier about the possible meeting on nov. 29. the four countries last met in the so-called 'normandy format' in october in an effort to kick-start implementation of the 2015 minsk peace deal. european diplomats worry that russia, emboldened by trump's promise to reset washington's ties with moscow, could launch new offensives in ukraine before trump is sworn in on jan. 20. a french official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said invitations to the new meeting on ukraine had been

Article 7 - world is about to find out what trump really believes
world is about to find out what trump really believes the new york times 1 hr ago by david e. sanger, maggie haberman and binyamin appelbaum © damon winter/the new york times donald j. trump on election night. he faces some of the biggest quandaries on security, and sees little long-term benefit from funding efforts to eliminate the root causes of terrorism, preferring military solutions. washington — in donald j. trump’s private conversations and public commentary, one guiding principle shines through: the world is a zero-sum place, and nations, like real estate developers, are either on the winning side of a deal or the losing side. yet he also is the ultimate pragmatist, perfectly willing to dispense with seemingly core beliefs in return for negotiating advantage. that is why many of his closest supporters have long cautioned that the most headline-grabbing proposals of his run for the presidency should not be taken literally — they are guideposts, the supporters suggest, not plans. even mr. trump once described his proposed ban on muslim immigrants as a mere “suggestion.” as he enters the oval office that ronald reagan — another populist pragmatist, but one who had served in public office before the white house — left nearly 28 years ago, the world is about to find out what donald trump really believes. or at least what he is going to try to do, in partnership with republicans who on tuesday retained control of both houses

Article 8 - can obama speak strongly for peace?

Title: obama declares self-determination to be a threat to us national security (video)
Content: (before it's news) via paul craig roberts in his march 6 executive order, “blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in ukraine,” obama declares that support for crimean self-determination constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states, and i hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.” http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation obama and the lawyers who drafted his executive order did not notice that the way the order is drafted it applies to obama, to the unelected coup government in kiev, and to the washington and eu regimes. the order says that any person “responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly . . . actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in ukraine” is subject to having his assets frozen. washington and the eu are the only two governments whose personnel have undermined democratic processes and institutions in ukraine by overthrowing the elected government and imposing an unelected one. self-determination is pure democracy. i understand the implications of not being able to hold one’s country together but you know what, if the central government has become entrenched in corruption, greed and war mongering than, short of civil war, what other peaceful way can people get away from it? secession is a right. yes, a right that lincoln took away from the south. we were more than happy to let texas do it to mexico 15 years earlier but we crushed them when they tried to do it to us.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The US and Russia have agreed to a pact to de-escalate tensions in Ukraine. The agreement was reached during Geneva talks involving US Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Ukrainian Acting Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia, and EU Representative Catherine Ashton.

However, the agreement does not require Russia to remove its troops from Ukraine's border or commit to direct talks with the interim Ukrainian government. The European Union is likely to extend economic sanctions on Russia over Ukraine in December, but may be harder to renew if Donald Trump becomes US President.

The US has proposed arming Ukraine with anti-tank missiles and other arms, which could escalate tensions with Russia. Germany and France have invited Ukraine and Russia to meet for four-way talks on November 29 to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

President Barack Obama is facing pressure from Senator John McCain to take a stronger stance against Syria, Iran, and Russia. Obama must find the courage to correct his administration's narrative on Ukraine and cooperate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve world peace.

The situation remains tense, with fighting between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists continuing in eastern Ukraine. The US is developing plans for actions that would escalate over time if Russia continues to support the separatists.

democrats are the party of the rich % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) we hear it over and over. republicans (of which i am not a member) are the party of the rich. conservatives (which i am) are heartless because they want people to be more independent. republicans are “the rich.” we see this in the class warfare rhetoric of president obama and the occupiers, who apparently resent anyone having anything someone else doesn’t have. witness good old al sharpton claiming the mission isn’t accomplished until everyone has the same stuff. rep. john duncan has written recently about the truth of who actually votes republican.. the biggest lie in american politics is that the republican party is the party of the rich or wealthy. in fact, the atlantic magazine, a year after the 2000 election, had an article comparing red and blue america. it said montgomery county, md., one of the wealthiest counties, voted 68 percent for al gore, while franklin county, pa., one of the poorest counties, voted 68 percent forgeorge w. bush. the article said in franklin county, the cracker barrel was the most expensive restaurant and the death of dale earnhardt was a big event, while in montgomery county, most people did not even know who dale earnhardt was. let’s look at “the poor,” as defined by president obama, from the

the future of wisconsin headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by john f. di leo - there’s an old saying: a conservative is a liberal who got mugged. well, the state of wisconsin is now filled with such newly minted conservatives. after decades of the corrupt partnership between the democratic party, the public and private unions (especially weac), and the state’s bureaucracy, the residents of wisconsin have watched their economic opportunities plummet and their government costs rise. manufacturers have fled the state in droves, ever fewer new startups have arrived to take their place, and their taxes have continued to climb, taking ever-larger bites of an ever-shrinking taxpayer base. taxpayers feel like they’ve been mugged, again and again, for decades, and more and more of them are learning their lesson. politically, wisconsin is undergoing a realignment, wherein people who once thought that conservatives went too far – that conservatives just weren’t reasonable enough – are finally acknowledging that conservatives were right all along. and this is happening, for wisconsinites, at just the right time, because it’s happening at a time when the wisconsin republican party is actually nominating real conservatives for high office. businessman ron johnson won his us senate seat, and governor and lt governor scott walker and rebecca kleefisch won their executive offices, in november of 2010 for this reason. it’s an unprecedented awakening in the state still

Article 4 - do republicans have short memories?
do republicans have short memories? (before it's news) do republicans have short memories? december 13, 2010 by mary jo dilling we’re not even seven weeks removed from the midterm election, an election in which the american people sent a loud and clear message to congress to stop its profligate spending and sleazy deal making. the agreement between the president and republicans to extend the bush tax rates for all americans for two years contains details objectionable to both sides. two years of extensions is hardly a confidence builder for businesses that plan in five to ten year time frames. but it is better than nothing. extension of unemployment benefits for an additional 13 months, while certainly a humane effort in the short run, delays the inevitable and incentivizes many workers to lay low and wait for jobs to come along that are compatible with their current skills and wage expectations. in reality, with our weak economy and no realistic prospects for a real surge, these workers are not going to return to their current job skills and wages. but a compromise had to be made. the far left, all that essentially remains on the democrat side after the new congress is sworn in, plus many of the soon to be ousted democrats, just couldn’t swallow the compromise. they have thrown tantrums, disparaged president obama for compromising with the republicans, and begun larding up the deal. it appears that many republicans will accept the load of pork that the democrats are busy

tea party crashes: the most unpatriotic act (before it's news) by susan lindauer i confess that since november i’ve been holding my breath, watching the clock for how long tea party newcomers could hold out against the entrenched republican elite on capitol hill. collapse was inevitable, however i admit to feeling bitterly surprised at how rapidly they have thrown in the towel. “my disappointment is particularly acute. rather notoriously, i am distinguished as the second non-arab american to face indictment under the patriot act, after jose padilla.” – susan lindauer for the record, most of the tea party quit their principles of liberty on february 14, 2011—20 days into the new congress—when tea party leaders abruptly abandoned their opposition to the patriot act and voted to extend intrusive domestic surveillance, wire tapping and warrantless searches of american citizens. in so doing, they exposed the fraud of their soaring campaign promises to defend the liberty of ordinary americans, and fight government intrusions on freedom. all those wide eyed speeches that flowed with such thrilling devotions, all of it proved to be self-aggrandizing lies. the tea party didn’t even put up a fight. briefly they rejected a sneak attack to renew three surveillance clauses of the patriot act on a suspension vote. that filled my heart with hope. one push from the republican elite, however and they went down with a loud thud. my disappointment is particularly acute. rather notoriously, i am distinguished

independence day: should we celebrate the resounding failure of this government to represent our founders principals? (before it's news) commentary by: roger landry (tlb) look around you … no i mean really look around you, and you will see the collapse of a republic via the mechanisms of a representative government wrought with corruption, cronyism, greed, complicity and (theatrical) infighting. this is resulting in the slow but inevitable awakening of we the people, regardless of our political affiliation or mindset, to this painful reality. a historically large majority of americans today no longer trust any of the triad of governance we depend on to lead this country (see attached article below). and this is not a democrat or republican issue as this fall from grace has been long in coming. to blame one or the other merely plays into the hands of those who wish us distracted and divided. but to not see the marked acceleration of this process since the dawn of the twenty-first century and the shift into overdrive in the last six years is to pose a blind eye to absolute reality. a serious look at the shift in policy and conscience of this government during the stated period reveals the constant erosion of our unalienable rights, our precious freedoms, our standard of living, our respect in the global community and more. this all culminates in a country devoid of self respect. today we suffer the following (a partial list): the mutation of unalienable rights into

Article 8 - the end of the beginning?
the end of the beginning? (before it's news) the last not quite two years have been exciting. the tea party movement has grown from protests and rallies and inundating congress with phone calls, e-mails, and visits about pending legislation, to getting real fiscal conservatives elected to congress. we brought the foundational principles of constitutionality and fiscal discipline and the issue of mounting debt to the forefront of our national political conversation. in terms of concrete achievements, we have a mixed record. we were effective in delaying, but not defeating, unconstitutional and fiscally irresponsible congressional legislation such as obamacare and stimulus spending. on the other hand, we helped to elect and reelect many tea party supporters and members to both federal and state levels. those we helped elect to the house of representatives have not disappointed in their first working week. they passed the bill to repeal obamacare, which fulfills a specific promise. hopefully, the debate in the senate will reveal many of obamacare’s many flaws and will build further public support against it, highlighting the fact that president obama and the senate democrats are not concerned with either the constitution or the will of the american people. equally important, fiscal conservatives introduced in both the senate and the house legislation to cut specific funding for specific programs to the tune of $$2.5 trillion over the next ten years. unconstitutional spending to support the national endowment of the arts, the national endowment of the humanities, planned parenthood, the public broadcasting corporation, the m

Article 1 - a memorial to evoke the horror of that day
to the editor: maureen dowd (''unbearable lightness of memory,'' column, nov. 30) is right about the finalists for the ground zero memorial: they seem saccharine and feel-good, not memorials in the sense that they evoke some of the enormity of a tragic day. that memory seems in this light to be a wound still raw, one that we would rather balm right now than risk opening. did memorials of past tragedies seem this way at first? maybe. like it or not, i believe that sept. 11 will always be a part of us and that we need a way to acknowledge that, be it through great words or a work of art or music. right now, there doesn't seem to be a lot out there. james mechalakos new york, nov. 30, 2003

Article 2 - 10 new sitcoms meant to cure the recession blues
 “when the economy’s not doing well, you tend to have more comedies, more escapism,” said steve sternberg, executive vice president for audience analysis at magna, part of the mediabrands division of the interpublic group of companies. several new sitcoms are particularly interesting, mr. sternberg said, because they are “family comedies scheduled before 9:30” — making them “programming you can watch with your kids.” viewers “are looking for that,” he added, so such shows are potentially desirable for advertisers. mr. sternberg praised an abc family sitcom he watched in preview form, “modern family,” as “one of the best pilots i’ve seen in years.” david campanelli, vice president and director for national television at horizon media, echoed that assessment. photo “it was the best one i’d seen in a while at the upfront,” mr. campanelli said, using the term derived from the practice of the networks’ presenting their schedules — and selling commercials — before the season starts. other forms of escapist entertainment for 2009-10 include new science fiction and fantasy series like “day one,” on nbc; “flash forward” and “v,” on abc; “human target” and “past life,” on fox; and “the vampire diaries,” on cw, owned by cbs and time warner. “you’ve got the dead, the undead and the almost dead,” said shari anne

to the editor: there is a way of commemorating the victims of 9/11 in new york and elsewhere that would transcend the disparate views of business owners, architects, commuters, historians and relatives of the dead and serve as an appropriate response to the assaults on our nation that day: make sept. 11 our national election-day holiday. this retaliatory action would speak more eloquently than any words about the american will. mary p. schmidtberger new city, n.y., sept. 2, 2002

Article 6 - the gloom over this presidency
to the editor: it makes me furious that members of the bush administration are confident that events in iraq will improve and therefore help turn around the president's poll numbers in time for the midterm elections. the bottom line is that if things in iraq were perfect tomorrow, it still grows more and more evident that this is a war sold to the american people with lies and deceit. think of all the lives that have been lost, all those injured and the treasure spent. despite what the president says, we are less safe today than before the war started. these are the things that need to be remembered on election day. these are the things that should never be forgotten. suzanne victor southampton, pa., may 10, 2006

Article 7 - preserving the voices of the twin towers
as producers of ''lost and found sound,'' a peabody award-winning series broadcast since 1999 on national public radio, ms. nelson and ms. silva specialize in creating historical documentaries from fragments of recorded sound. they have constructed documentary segments based on such artifacts as recordings from the collection of a new york man who has been taping the sounds of street life since 1945, and ''audio letters'' recorded by a young american soldier shortly before he was killed in vietnam. (listeners can browse in the ''lost and found sound'' archives at www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound.) for the new project, the team is working to save any recorded material that chronicles the history of the world trade center and the attacks that destroyed it. voice-mail messages are a primary focus, ms. nelson said, although the group is also hoping to collect sounds from dictation tapes, tourist videos made before sept. 11, training films used by world trade center tenants, audio recordings of financial transactions or any other ''shards of sound that capture the expressions, exchanges, and humanity that defined the buildings.'' there have been unexpected discoveries, like a video e-mail message sent from a kiosk that was situated on the observation deck of the twin towers. the message was recorded by tourists who visited the world trade center last spring. the project invites anyone with audio artifacts related to the world trade center to call (202) 408-0300, the same national

The US Congress was close to a deadlock on the ""supercommittee"" aimed at reducing the deficit. Republicans were unwilling to agree to higher taxes, and Democrats refused to accept any package without revenue increases.

**Police Focus on Quality-of-Life Issues**

New York City police launched Operation Clean Sweep, targeting panhandlers, prostitutes, and squeegee men in low-income areas. The effort resulted in over 70 arrests and nearly 200 summonses.

Article 1 - michael mabee says government not prepared for any downed-grid scenarios
michael mabee says government not prepared for any downed-grid scenarios (before it's news) off the grid news recently sat down with preparedness author and law enforcement expert michael mabee, whose latest book, “prepping for a suburban or rural community,” who argues that most prepping plans are insufficient if the power grid goes down. like a growing number of americans, mabee is concerned about the nation’s overly burdened and vulnerable power grid. otg: in prepping for a suburban or rural community, you focus on the need for all americans to become more self-reliant. do you feel, as many off-grid and homesteaders do, that being so dependent upon technology has made an entire generations of americans weak? michael mabee: we are generations removed from adversity and generations removed from self-reliance. this definitely makes us weak. anybody who lived through the great depression is in their 80s or 90s now. for most americans, we were born and grew up dependent on technology, specifically the power grid. we are not self-reliant – we are grid-reliant. everything is fine as long as all our infrastructures work – food, water, sanitation, medical care and our government. but all of these infrastructures – including basic rule of law – are completely dependent on the power grid. the majority of people don’t think of it; without the electric grid, there is no food, no water,

Article 2 - cyber attacks will target physical infrastructure, commerce, transportation systems
(before it's news) mac slavo september 14th, 2011 shtfplan.com in may of 2010 we reported that a well coordinated cyber attack could cripple the entire country in a matter of 15 minutes . we are totally dependent on inter-networks to perform even the most mundane of day-to-day tasks. our enemies know this, and they have been actively testing our defense capabilities for years. over the last couple of decades foreign governments, namely china and russia, as well as loosely organized hacker groups, have been taking advantage of malware, trojans, trapdoors and backdoors in public and private networks as they map our strengths and vulnerabilities. according to general keith alexander, commander of u.s. cyber command, the threat to the national security of the united states is only getting worse, and a massive cyber attack could strike at anytime: the general in charge of u.s. cyberwarfare forces said tuesday that future computer-based combat likely will involve electronic strikes that cause widespread power outages and even physical destruction of thousand-ton machines. army gen. keith alexander, commander of the new u.s. cyber command, also said that massive losses of private and public data in recent years to computer criminals and spies represent the largest theft in history. threats posed by cyber-attacks on computer networks and the internet are escalating from large-scale theft of data and strikes designed to disrupt computer operations to more lethal attacks that destroy entire systems and physical equipment

dhs chief napolitano invokes 9/11 to push for cispa 2.0 % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) rt news in an attempt to scare the public with a looming cyber attack on us infrastructure, us homeland security secretary janet napolitano is once again pushing congress to pass legislation allowing the government to have greater control over the internet. first reported by reuters, napolitano was quoted as saying: “we shouldn’t wait until there is a 9/11 in the cyber world. there are things we can and should be doing right now that, if not prevent, would mitigate the extent of damage.” napolitano issued the warnings thursday, claiming that inaction could result in a “cyber 9/11” attack that could knock out water, electricity and gas, causing destruction similar to that left behind by hurricane sandy. napolitano said that in order to prevent such an attack, congress must pass legislation that gives the us government greater access to the internet and cybersecurity information from the private sector. such a bill, known as cispa or cyber intelligence sharing and protection act, was already introduced last year, but failed to pass in congress due to concerns expressed by businesses and privacy advocates. “we shouldn’t wait until there is a 9/11 in the cyber world. there are things we can and should be doing right now that, if not

statement by donald j. trump on the elevation of cyber command (before it's news) i have directed that united states cyber command be elevated to the status of a unified combatant command focused on cyberspace operations. this new unified combatant command will strengthen our cyberspace operations and create more opportunities to improve our nation’s defense. the elevation of united states cyber command demonstrates our increased resolve against cyberspace threats and will help reassure our allies and partners and deter our adversaries. united states cyber command’s elevation will also help streamline command and control of time-sensitive cyberspace operations by consolidating them under a single commander with authorities commensurate with the importance of such operations. elevation will also ensure that critical cyberspace operations are adequately funded. in connection with this elevation, the secretary of defense is examining the possibility of separating united states cyber command from the national security agency. he will announce recommendations on this matter at a later date. through united states cyber command, we will tackle our cyberspace challenges in coordination with like-minded allies and partners as we strive to respond rapidly to evolving cyberspace security threats and opportunities globally. source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/18/statement-donald-j-trump-elevation-cyber-command

Article 5 - nsa spying on verizon phone records is nothing new
nsa spying on verizon phone records is nothing new (before it's news) this article was originally published on the madison independent examiner. a video that takes a closer look at fusion centers is available there. nsa spying on verizon phone records is nothing new, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. the “shocking” revelation that the nsa requested phone records from verizon is not surprising to anyone who has been watching the rise of the police state that america has become since 9/11. the only thing new is now that a british newspaper published the story, the u.s. media and congress have to acknowledge it very publicly. today, lawmakers such as senate intelligence committee chairman dianne feinstein (d-ca), house speaker john boehner (r-oh), and lindsey graham (r-sc) defended the practice as essential for national security. others such as rand paul (r-ky) and jeff merkely (d-or) called it, respectively, an “astounding assault on the constitution” and an “outrageous breach of americans’ privacy.” while senator feinstein stated that the practice has been in place since 2009, senate majority leader harry reid (d-nv) more correctly pointed out that “it’s gone on for some seven years.” indeed, the legal justification for monitoring the phone calls of u.s. citizens can be traced back to the patriot act, which became law

Article 6 - the internet post
“tom dispatch” – – first the financial system collapses and it’s impossible to access one’s money. then the power and water systems stop functioning. within days, society has begun to break down. in the cities, mothers and fathers roam the streets, foraging for food. the country finds itself fractured and fragmented — hardly recognizable. it may sound like a scene from a zombie apocalypse movie or the first episode of nbc’s popular new show “revolution,” but it could be your life — a nationwide cyber-version of ground zero. think of it as 9/11/2015. it’s secretary of defense leon panetta’s vision of the future — and if he’s right (or maybe even if he isn’t), you better wonder what the future holds for erstwhile american civil liberties, privacy, and constitutional protections. last week, panetta addressed the business executives for national security, an organization devoted to creating a robust public-private partnership in matters of national security. standing inside the intrepid, new york’s retired aircraft-carrier-cum-military-museum, he offered a hair-raising warning about an imminent and devastating cyber strike at the sinews of american life and wellbeing. yes, he did use that old alarm bell of a “cyber pearl harbor,” but for anyone interested in american civil liberties and rights, his truly chilling image was far more immediate. “a cyber attack perpetrated by nation states or violent extremist groups,” he predicted, “could be as destructive as

Article 7 - the dhs defends globalism, not america
the dhs defends globalism, not america (before it's news) be prepared for the next great transfer of wealth. buy physical silver and storable food. alt-market.com tuesday, 07 february 2012 04:55 brandon smith the department of homeland security is the very epitome of unnecessary bureaucracy. its formation was predicated on the existence of terrorist threats, many of which the u.s. government and orbiting alphabet agencies either created through acts of war, or fabricated out of thin air. its policies of centralization were sold to the public as necessary to prevent systemic “miscommunications” that never actually took place. throughout our history, it has been a rare occasion indeed when an attack falls upon american infrastructure or interests that was not influenced, directly or indirectly, by the actions of agencies which were supposedly employed to prevent such events from ever occurring. whether through ‘blowback’, or through ‘false flag’, frankly, most of the harm that comes to our nation is perpetrated by the guiding hand of our inexorably corrupt government. knowing that the dhs was established on false pretenses forces us to question the agency’s true intentions, especially when a professional fear-monger like secretary janet napolitano announces that the globalization of the world economy falls within her jurisdiction: http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/01/27/the-urgent-need-to-protect-the-global-supply-chain/ average citizens would assume

""then the united states couldn't use its own space station,"" dr. griffin later told reporters. at the hearing, senator kay bailey hutchison, republican of texas, said a spaceship gap would be ""not only a risk to the important scientific work that we are doing, but it is also a security risk to our country."" dr. griffin said that by mid-july, he hoped to have a plan developed by a study group to speed development of the crew vehicle and the rocket that will launch it. he acknowledged that accelerated plans often cost more initially, but said the plan could end up saving money in other ways. for instance, he said, choosing a single contractor by 2006, rather than having two competing teams of contractors doing flight demonstrations in 2008 as earlier envisioned, could save $1 billion or more for use in the near term. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. dr. griffin said that current development was focusing on using the vehicle for long-distance exploration, perhaps making it part of a ship to return to the moon, and that its role for serving the space station in the

Article 4 - the military is not the police
it was disturbing to learn the other day just how close the last administration came to violating laws barring the military from engaging in law enforcement when president george w. bush considered sending troops into a buffalo suburb in 2002 to arrest terrorism suspects. unfortunately, this is not necessarily a problem of the past. more needs to be done to ensure that the military is not illegally deployed in this country. the posse comitatus act of 1878 generally prohibits the military from law enforcement activities within the united states . if armed officers are going to knock on americans’ doors, or arrest them in the streets, they should answer to civilian authorities. despite this bedrock principle, the times’s mark mazzetti and david johnston reported last week, top bush administration officials, including (no surprise) vice president dick cheney , argued that the president had the authority to use the military to round up a suspected terrorist cell known as the lackawanna six. mr. cheney and others cited a legal memorandum co-written by john c. yoo (author of the infamous torture memo), which made the baseless claim that the military can go after accused al qaeda terrorists on united states soil because it would be a matter of national security, not law enforcement. advertisement continue reading the main story the lackawanna six controversy is history, but there are troubling signs the military may be injecting itself today into law enforcement. the american civil liberties union has been sounding the alarm about the proliferation

Article 6 - national pride over a virus in philippines

republicans, looking for leverage to slash federal spending, created the phony debt-ceiling crisis that led to creation of the congressional deficit-cutting “ supercommittee .” but with the committee close to a deadlock — largely because republicans will not agree to higher taxes on the rich — and the deadline for an agreement approaching, some republicans are now talking about undoing the process. we are no fans of the supercommittee. it is undemocratic, and the deep, automatic cuts the law would impose if the committee fails to reach agreement are gimmicky and potentially dangerous. but walking away at this point would be an embarrassment for congress and a far-reaching blow to washington’s financial credibility. the committee of 12, divided between the two parties, was required by the budget control act to come up with a plan to shrink the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over the next decade through any combination of spending cuts and revenue increases. if the members fail to agree, the law would automatically “sequester” $1.2 trillion in spending cuts — heavily affecting defense programs. democrats have proposed a $4 trillion mix of cuts and tax increases, carving too deeply from domestic programs. but republicans have rejected any tax increases, and democrats are rightly refusing to agree to any package without revenues. advertisement continue reading the main story if the committee fails, representative k. michael conaway, a texas republican on the house armed services committee, told the times, “most

Article 8 - police return to a focus on panhandling and prostitution
police commissioner raymond w. kelly said yesterday that sweeps begun friday as part of a renewed effort to crack down on panhandlers, prostitutes and squeegee men have resulted in more than 70 arrests and nearly 200 summonses. mr. kelly and mayor michael r. bloomberg held a news conference in queens to announce the new effort, called operation clean sweep, which will use citizen complaints to a city telephone line and the compstat crime-tracking system to monitor seven low-level offenses. ''this is a very high priority,'' mr. kelly said as he stood on a sidewalk near queens plaza, an area that residents say has been beset by squeegee men and prostitutes since the sept. 11 terror attacks led to a reduction of patrol officers in the area. ''we want to assure new yorkers that we are concerned about the quality of life,'' mr. kelly said. ''in the wake of 9/11, there was a redeployment of police resources. we're now back focusing on these quality-of-life violations.'' advertisement continue reading the main story mr. kelly urged people to report low-level crimes by calling 888-677-life so the police could keep track of areas where the offenses are occurring. since before he took office, mr. bloomberg has stressed that he wants to renew the effort of his predecessor, rudolph w. giuliani, in focusing on lower-level crimes as a way to bring down the number of more serious

Title: kelly plans to cut money for overtime police patrols
Content: even as he acknowledged the budgetary constraints, mr. kelly said there were some things that the department could not do without. among them, he said, are increased counterterrorism training and new equipment, like protective suits and radiation detectors, which he expects will be paid for by the federal government, and an upgrade for the department's computer systems. in focusing on the department's technology, mr. kelly noted that the 55,000-person agency had no systemwide e-mail. ''i don't think you can find an organization in this country that size that doesn't have e-mail,'' he said. mr. kelly said he hoped to draw on the expertise of mayor michael r. bloomberg to improve the department's computer, communications and technology systems, areas in which solutions have long eluded department managers. mr. kelly said he would also try to solve some of those problems with outside contractors. the commissioner also said he planned to hire an outside consultant to evaluate the department's response to the world trade center attack, to better prepare should the city suffer another terrorist attack. ''what lessons should we learn from sept. 11?'' he said.

''that's the question.'' last year, the department spent as much as $10 million a month on the condor program, in which officers are assigned to work a sixth day in a week to bolster the police presence on city streets, officials said. for the next six months, the department will have

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various concerns related to national security, government preparedness, and the impact of technology on society. 

Michael Mabee, a preparedness expert, warns that most prepping plans are insufficient if the power grid goes down, as Americans have become too dependent on technology. He believes this has made generations weak and self-reliant.

Mac Slavo reports that foreign governments and hacker groups have been testing US defense capabilities for years, with potential massive cyber attacks causing widespread power outages and physical destruction.

US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano invokes 9/11 to push for CISPA 2.0, a bill allowing the government greater control over the internet and cybersecurity information from private sectors.

President Donald Trump elevates US Cyber Command to a unified combatant command focused on cyberspace operations, aiming to strengthen national defense and deter adversaries.

NSA spying on Verizon phone records is not new, with the practice dating back to 2009 under the Patriot Act. Lawmakers defend the practice as essential for national security, while others call it an ""astounding assault on the constitution.""

Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta predicts a devastating cyber strike could be as destructive as 9/11, and the Department of Homeland Security defends globalism over American interests.

Article 2 - a hapless brazil incurs massive losses on fx swaps amid currency carnage
a hapless brazil incurs massive losses on fx swaps amid currency carnage (before it's news) as we’ve documented extensively of late, a host of idiosyncratic political factors have served to exacerbate what was already a very, very bad situation for emerging markets. this dynamic is most readily apparent in brazil and turkey, and although ankara probably has a leg up in the race for “most at risk from domestic turmoil”, brazil isn’t far behind as president dilma rousseff battles abysmal approval ratings and a recalcitrant congress in an effort to shore up the country’s finances by convincing lawmakers to sign off on much needed austerity measures. meanwhile, a confluence of exogenous shocks that include slumping commodity prices, depressed chinese demand, the pboc yuan devaluation, and the threat of an imminent fed hike have conspired with country-specific political turmoil to send the brl plunging and that, in turn, has put copom in what former treasury secretary carlos kawall calls “crisis mode.” of course crises are often costly to combat, especially when you’re an emerging market in the current environment and when it comes to brazil, the use of alternative measures (like effectively selling dollars in the futures market) to avoid fx reserve liquidation is now weighing heavily on the fiscal outlook. as goldman noted earlier this week on the heels of the latest monthly budget data, “the overall fiscal deficit is tracking at a disquieting 9

Article 3 - the collective delusion of grandeur fades: central bank inflationism is visibly on the wane
(before it's news) submitted by sean corrigan via true sinews blog, regular readers of these pages (whether here or in the author’s previous professional incarnations) will recognise that the analysis is informed by a core belief that while money should never be confused with wealth – and that therefore the latter cannot be conjured up by the central bank like a rabbit from a magician’s hat, however much people might wish it were so – the former is anything but neutral in its effect upon the creation, the distribution, and even the destruction of said wealth. a secondary, but still highly important distinction to which we insist it is necessary to hold fast is that money – the supreme present good, the demand liability instantly and universally redeemable today at par, the generally dominant (if not absolutely exclusive) medium responsible for the smooth and efficient exchange of goods and services, the great enabling mechanism which obviates the need not just for barter, but for interpersonal trust among a transaction’s counterparties – is different from credit – which latter is actually a claim on money (and hence on the potential to acquire all other goods) only realisable in the future. as walter boyd put it in his celebrated letter to pm william pitt of 1801 in which he excoriated both the bank of england’s wartime suspension of the convertibility of its issue and the ill-understood inflation to which it gave rise:- ‘by the words “means of circulation,” “circulating medium”

Article 5 - sa battles in global currency war
sa battles in global currency war % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! johannesburg – the reserve bank bought at least $618m in the currency markets to try to push the rand weaker in september, the bank’s latest statement on its gold and foreign exchange reserves shows. this is more than the $504m bought the previous month. that is sa’s contribution to the so-called currency war being waged in international markets at the moment. it’s small by international standards – central banks like brazil’s think nothing of buying $1bn a day. a wall of foreign capital has flowed to emerging markets because of abnormally low interest rates in developed countries. this flood of capital is pushing up currencies all over the world, and central banks have been intervening (buying dollars) to stop their currencies from overheating. the reserve bank’s intervention figure is arrived at by looking at the bank’s forward position, because it invests dollars it buys in the forward market. it does this to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of intervening in the currency market. the cost arises because there is an inflow of rands into the money market when the reserve bank buys dollars, which heightens money supply and is a danger for inflation. this inflow of rands needs to be “sterilised”. rand merchant bank (rmb) economists calculate that the “naked intervention” in the market could

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The current market trends and economic indicators are as follows:

* The US dollar is weakening, with the US dollar index dropping 0.91% to $79.39, while the euro rallied 1.24% to $1.34 vs. the dollar.
* Emerging markets, such as Brazil and South Africa, are experiencing significant currency fluctuations due to domestic turmoil and exogenous shocks.
* The Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA) has been intervening in the foreign exchange market, buying at least $618m in September to push the rand weaker.
* The US economy is experiencing better-than-expected growth, with a preliminary print of +5.7% GDP in the fourth quarter.
* However, this growth is accompanied by high unemployment rates (20%) and concerns about inflation.
* Analysts are warning that the US dollar is not going to zero anytime soon due to its strong foreign exchange dynamics and the fact that it has more going for it than generally understood.
* The euro appears immune from the old adage ""no news is good news,"" falling to a four-year low versus the US dollar, with many analysts predicting a continued decline.

These trends suggest that investors should be cautious and monitor market developments closely.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY

The US presidential election has significant implications for the global economy. The dollar is expected to rise against other currencies, particularly the euro and yen, due to bets on faster inflation and higher interest rates under a Trump administration.

Asian shares are cautious ahead of the US presidential election, with investor sentiment buoyed by improving prospects for Hillary Clinton to win. However, emerging markets are under pressure due to fears of higher interest rates and a potential global trade shock.

The Canadian dollar has recovered from an 8-month low against the US dollar, but remains weaker than expected due to concerns about Trump's impact on Canada's trade-intensive economy.

The US dollar is at its highest level since 2003, with benchmark yields on track for their steepest two-week increase in 13 years. Treasuries have resumed a selloff, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit a record intraday high before slipping lower.

Overall, investors are bracing for a potential shift in monetary policy under Trump's administration, which could impact emerging markets and asset prices globally.

is an african lion roaming the city streets? (before it's news) is an african lion roaming the streets of norwalk, ca? security cameras captured footage of what seems to be a large cat. the footage is of course grainy, so it’s hard to tell exactly what it is. in my experience as a naturalist at the national wildlife federation, i can say that most people are just not that good at identifying wildlife, so i’m never too quick to believe the media hype over this kind of thing without further investigation or commentary from an actual wildlife expert. when you’re looking at such grainy footage, it’s even easy for experts to be stumped or even make misidentifications. so take what you’re hearing and reading in the media with a grain of salt. so with that said, check out this report from good morning america. get my take on what i think the video shows below. abc news | more abc news videos in my opinion, the animal in the video definitely moves like a large cat versus a dog, including wild dogs such as coyotes and foxes. often, domestic cats are mistaken for big cats in grainy or dark videos like this one, but this animal defintely looks more massive than a domestic cat to me. bobcats and mountain lions are native to the area, but the head is much larger and thicker than that of a mountain lion and the animal’s long, thin tail rules out a bobcat. i don’t see

the cannock chase panther (before it's news) (image: wikipedia) since the 1970′s literally hundreds (if not, thousands) of big cat sightings have been reported from within the chase’s mysterious plantation, often by seemingly rational and trustworthy witnesses. in truth, these accounts have received more publicity within the national and international press than any other phenomena reported in the area, so predictably this is a very hot topic that creates a whole load of controversy – something i’m a huge fan of. in 1976 the dangerous animals act came into force in england, which made it illegal to keep fierce and predatory creatures as pets without a licence. the problem was though, many people already had these animals, and thanks to parliament, they were now breaking the law. without having much choice in the matter, pet owners far and wide began releasing their ferocious, wild beasts into secluded countryside locations. unfortunately, many of these animals would have struggled to survive unaided in england, however, is it possible that some species were more suited to our climate than others? have exotic cats been breeding secretly for the last 40 years? some journalists and researchers would argue that the evidence suggests they have. (image: wikipedia) to illustrate the reality of this situation, in 1989 the body of an asian jungle cat was found in the town of ludlow, shropshire (around 25 miles outside of cannock chase). some people believe that this jungle cat

Article 6 - asia’s enigmatic clouded leopard threatened by palm oil plantations
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! desdemona despair by sean mowbray 17 august 2017 (mongabay) – tigers and orangutans are the well-known faces of the palm oil crisis. but the enigmatic clouded leopard is equally threatened and almost unknown in comparison. conservationists are looking at ways to make palm oil plantations work for it, rather than against it. “we know very little about what [clouded leopards] eat, their social structure, their ecology, how much time they spend in trees… we know very, very little,” ewan macdonald, of oxford university’s wildlife conservation research unit (cru), told mongabay. he studied the species for his phd but has yet to see it in the wild, apart from through his camera trap images. it’s what can be called a “small, big cat” says anthony giordano, founder and director of s.p.e.c.i.e.s., and has been largely overlooked by both the public and conservationists in comparison to some of its more famous counterparts like tigers or snow leopards. “when you think of a secretive species it’s quite normal to think of snow leopards, but i think we know more about them than we know about clouded leopards.” all this secrecy brings about a sense of déjà-vu when talking to those who study clouded leopards, as

Article 1 - ‘ok, so you drain the swamp; what happens next?’
a reader in california, james, describes himself as a “white, middle-class, christian, culturally-rural, ideologically-moderate independent” who is sympathetic to the grievances of trump supporters but couldn’t bring himself to vote for the guy. now with trump’s victory, james worries that the democratic norms and institutions of the u.s. won’t be able to withstand the dicey demagogue, and he fears that the country could veer down a painful path like that of venezuela, uruguay, and peru during the late 20 th century. here’s james: fascinating discussion, and i really appreciate the thoughtfulness of the responses on both sides and the courage of trump voters to explain their reasoning. but like reader pamela , i’m afraid i still don’t get it. i share many of the same concerns that other readers have brought up, but i feel like i must be missing a step. i am sympathetic to conservatives who felt that their voices were not being heard. i am a grad student, and i wish that conservatives were better-represented in my discipline, political science. i also wish that conservative students at my university felt safer in expressing viewpoints that differ from those of the majority on campus. i think that some individuals are over-zealous in their political correctness, though i would hardly attribute this to “liberalism” as a whole any more than i would attribute racism to “conservatism.” most people i know—whether on the left or

there i was, a pushover for crystal clear air and a cloudless sky backdrop to trees that surrounded our lake, whose leaves ranged the spectrum of a prism. i had been seduced by black and white holsteins grazing on grassy hillsides and flirting with tree-mottled shade. nearly 14 years ago, my husband and i chose to move from our brooklyn heights town house to a local town that is as foreign to city dwellers as timbuktu. this four-acre eden in sussex county would become home. here, we were to learn, four-legged creatures dictate the law of the land. here, i longed to stroke deer that came at dusk to nibble on fallen apples. or to watch overhead as the leader of an escher-like squadron of canada geese honked directions for his armada to land on our lake. i was excited to see, for the first time, live swimming beavers. my two urban cats were enticed by squirrels, chipmunks, birds and butterflies, all of which, with country smarts, eluded claws of city predators. my own honeymoon with my seducer has lasted a long time. however, as are many great loves, mine is threatened by the classic unexpected source: the very things that drew me here are now lilith in the garden of eden. remember the deer? and the geese? and the beaver? not to mention rabbits, moles and groundh

Article 3 - becoming a hardened killer
we bought some “humane” mousetraps — miniature garages of sorts with trap doors — and caught nearly a dozen critters throughout the house in three weeks. karen and the kids built tiny cardboard homes and drove the little lottery winners to a farm with raspberries and a pond. then there was the frequent resetting of empty traps, which slammed shut at the slightest touch. but we had time and energy. the house was maintenance-free, and our children, who were then ages 1, 7 and 11, were fairly low maintenance as well. besides, the kids would tolerate no mouse killing. not long into this mousetrapping campaign, we found an empty peanut butter jar leaning against a crack in the wall of our mudroom. (we found out later that one of the kids had left the top off.) clearly, we were not putting a dent in the mouse population, so we called the exterminator. i showed him the empty boxes of peanut butter cups. i explained the positioning of the peanut butter jar. as i spoke, i realized i was talking about something that mice were not capable of. “you’ve definitely got a rodent problem,” he said. ah, yes. because “rodent” sounds so much better than “rat.” not wanting to wait “a couple of days” for him to return with his own traps, i ventured into the dirt crawl space and set a monstrous snap trap baited with peanut butter. no one

Article 4 - animals? in a zoo? heavens!
animals? in a zoo? heavens! q. i love visiting the bronx zoo, but i always wonder: does the zoo have a problem with wild animals moving in, like skunks, raccoons and possums? a. well, the zoo doesn’t exactly consider them a problem, but it doesn’t ignore them, either. “it’s no secret that there is native wildlife on the grounds of the bronx zoo,” said patrick thomas, general curator of the zoo. animals like skunks and raccoons are nocturnal; because they usually don’t show themselves during the day, visitors rarely see them. when such an animal does appear during the day, dr. thomas said, it may be sick and thus a threat to visitors, staff and the zoo’s animals. an animal department team traps the creature, which is then examined in the zoo’s wildlife health center. if the animal is sick and possibly rabid, it is killed humanely, and the remains are sent to the state veterinarian. (if you should see a nocturnal animal anywhere during the day, the safest thing is to keep your distance and call the local animal control agency.) one nocturnal animal living around the zoo, by the way, is josé the beaver, who last fall was found to have set up camp on the bronx river, which flows through the zoo. josé is the first north american beaver known to have shown up in the city in

Article 6 - brazil's wildlife, right outside your lodge room
the transpantaneira highway, despite its grand name, is an unfinished dirt road running 90 or so miles from the brazilian town of pocone into the pantanal, a vast wetlands many consider south america's finest destination for animal viewing. but it's not just a road: it's a crocodilian slalom course. as i jolted along in a rented fiat uno on a late august night, my headlights caught the glare of dozens of red eyes staring in the near pitch-black far ahead. they belonged to yacare caimans, alligator cousins that had decided the road was a comfortable resting spot. there are literally millions of caimans in the pantanal, and they don't make way for anyone. so i weaved around them, remembering the story that the car rental agent had told me just a few hours earlier about the time he had to sleep in his truck because the road was so caiman-covered he couldn't get by. i was luckier: minutes later, i was turning onto the road to pousada rio clarinho, the first of two lodges i would stay at during my pantanal trip. there were no more caimans, but the road through dense woods was winding and deeply rutted, slowing me to a bumpy crawl. i flipped on my high beams as i rounded a curve, slammed on the brakes and uttered a very loud, very profane expression of surprise. just 10 feet ahead

Article 7 - acting like animals
photo it’s not always easy to follow your heart. it can mean challenging the status quo, defying others’ expectations or, sometimes, discovering that those harboring strong preconceptions had you pegged correctly all along. and while children learn early on that a leopard can’t change his spots, it’s equally important to remember that each pattern is unique. three new picture books explore the nuances of individuality through the exploits of feral creatures who aren’t always what they appear to be — except, of course, when they are. in the opening pages of “mr. tiger goes wild,” the author-illustrator peter brown depicts his hero as a bright pop of orange in a sepia-toned, quasi-victorian city of bipedal deer and penny-farthing-riding squirrels clad in top hats, starched collars and overcoats. the stiffly anthropomorphized creatures maintain smug, sniffy expressions as they raise teacups, greet one another tepidly and admonish playful young rhinos, bears and pigs not to “act like wild animals.” (though his emerald-eyed, stoic expression never wavers, mr. tiger clearly gets the irony.) photo as brown showed in 2009’s “the curious garden,” in which a small patch of urban green tended by a determined boy named liam eventually transforms an entire city, a revolution can begin with a single, small act of defiance. one day, mr. tiger

Article 8 - going against the tide: beach houses in winter
the solitude, the sense that nobody else is home, is probably the biggest draw for those who love the beach in the off-season. dr. john willis, 62, a retired family physician from trumbull, conn., owns two houses on block island, where the population drops from more than 10,000 in august to about 1,000 in january and february. during the winter afternoons, the sun often sets at 4:30 and doesn't return until 7:30 a.m., and an almost-constant 25-mile-an-hour wind whistles over the fields. but it's a favorite time for dr. willis, who rents out both his houses in august because he prefers the off-season. ''i can't tell you how bleak, bleak really is,'' dr. willis said, describing the island in winter. ''there are no people, few services, not even a ferryboat if the weather is bad. but if you've spent 30 years with your phone ringing day and night and never stopping, bleak is a reprieve. bleak is beautiful.'' richard leibner, 63, head of the n. s. bienstock talent agency in new york -- his clients include dan rather and diane sawyer -- contends that there's nothing like fire island after labor day.

Article 1 - syria, yemen, and america’s quest for imperial dominance
(before it's news) neo-imperialism by faux-democracy, terrorism, and propaganda. may 25, 2012 – at the g8 summit last week, president obama and other officials in his administration, began utilizing the talking point of yemen being a model to be emulated in syria. ostensibly, they were referring to the “peaceful” transition of power in yemen as an example of what they would like to see in syria. however, the comparison goes much deeper than simply this superficial connection. the truth is that yemen represents, in more ways than one, the blueprint that the us imperialist ruling class would like to see applied to the escalating conflict in syria. puppet regimes and faux democracy the “transition” of power in yemen, from saleh to hadi, is a prime example of the hypocrisy of us policy, touting it as a victory for democracy while concealing the obvious fact that it was the creation of a puppet regime. abed rabbo mansour hadi has been presented as the legitimate leader of yemen, despite the fact that he was the u.s. choice to govern that country. his legitimacy depended on the myth of a democratically elected regime; the us propagates this myth wantonly, pretending that people won’t remember that hadi ran unopposed in february. if the purpose of democracy is to create forms of governance accountable to the citizenry and to establish a government that is truly representative

Article 4 - obama at a crossroads: to join russia or to fight against it
us president obama, due to the leadership of his secretary of state john kerry, has now turned away from the former us secretary of state hillary clinton’s obsession against russia, and is trying to back off from what had previously been the obama administration’s objective of overthrowing russia’s syrian ally bashar al-assad, whom even western polling shows to be overwhelmingly preferred by the syrian people to lead syria. assad is supported by syrians because he has always been resolutely determined to keep church and state separate – to keep islam out of lawmaking – and because the vast majority of the syrian people oppose sharia law: they’re the least-sectarian national population in the middle east. one poll showed that isis has very little public support in syria: i.e., «isis (islamic state) was rejected by 76% and approved by 21%», in one western-done poll of syrians. by contrast, the chief ally of the us, saudi arabia, is led by a jihadist royal family (by far the world’s wealthiest family), and a poll recently taken in saudi arabia shows 92% support there for isis. so, it’s not terribly surprising that the us government, which has perpetrated so many invasions and coups and been the sponsor of death squads, etc. (in guatemala, el salvador, iraq, etc.), has been co-leading, along

Article 1 - us hawks gamble on turkey’s invasions
exclusive: the mideast chaos gets more and more complicated as washington’s hawks encourage turkey to invade syria but worry about a possible clash between turkey and iraq, a maelstrom of violence that could spin out of control, writes joe lauria. by joe lauria as turkey mobilizes fresh troops on the iraqi border, iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi has warned that turkey’s invasion of his country will mean war. “turkey and its forces will be damaged and we warn them again, if their troops enter iraq we will fight them and we will look at them and treat them as the enemy,” he said. turkey has threatened to take part in the u.s.-led military operation to liberate mosul, iraq’s second-largest city now occupied by islamic state militants. turkey already has illegally deployed troops inside iraq but the broader invasion deeper into iraqi territory from an attack on mosul would represent a more direct challenge to iraqi sovereignty. “if we engage in war with them, the turks will pay a heavy price, they will be damaged,” al-abadi vowed to reporters in baghdad last tuesday. “we warn turkey if they want to enter iraq, they will end up becoming fragmented,” because turkey is “not a country to able to fight outside their borders.” turkey invaded cyprus 50 years ago, he said. “but iraq is not cyprus.” the silence to

Article 2 - ducking war responsibilities
conservatives insist that they revere the u.s. constitution, but congressional republicans as well as democrats hastily fled washington to hit the campaign trail rather than vote up or down on authorizing new wars in syria and iraq, an abdication of duty, says independent institute’s ivan eland. by ivan eland u.s. government officials recently began hyping the threat from a very small and little-known terrorist group called khorasan and then striking it in syria. several of president barack obama’s aides told the media that airstrikes were launched to foil an “imminent” terrorist attack, possibly using hidden explosives to blow up aircraft. yet other government officials seemed to pour cold water on that assessment. according to the new york times, one anonymous senior official described the khorasan plot as only “aspirational” and said that the group had not seemed to have established a concrete plan. other officials, at least one of who was a senior counterterrorism official, said that the plot was far from mature and that no sign existed that the group had decided on the method of attack or the time and target of it. these divergent stories should alert us to the possibility that the old saying, the first casualty of war is truth, is operating again (remember all the falsehoods surrounding then-president george w. bush’s invasion of iraq?). the times then cited some experts as explaining this divergence by saying that the obama administration may have developed

Article 3 - u.s.-approved arms for libya rebels fell into jihadis’ hands
the united states, which had only small numbers of c.i.a. officers in libya during the tumult of the rebellion, provided little oversight of the arms shipments. within weeks of endorsing qatar’s plan to send weapons there in spring 2011, the white house began receiving reports that they were going to islamic militant groups. they were “more antidemocratic, more hard-line, closer to an extreme version of islam” than the main rebel alliance in libya, said a former defense department official. the qatari assistance to fighters viewed as hostile by the united states demonstrates the obama administration’s continuing struggles in dealing with the arab spring uprisings, as it tries to support popular protest movements while avoiding american military entanglements. relying on surrogates allows the united states to keep its fingerprints off operations, but also means they may play out in ways that conflict with american interests. “to do this right, you have to have on-the-ground intelligence and you have to have experience,” said vali nasr, a former state department adviser who is now dean of the paul h. nitze school of advanced international studies, part of johns hopkins university . “if you rely on a country that doesn’t have those things, you are really flying blind. when you have an intermediary, you are going to lose control.” he said that qatar would not have gone through with the arms shipments if the united states had resisted them, but other current and former

Article 3 - baby jesus and freedom: implications of the incarnation
(before it's news) [from the author’s book, manifested in the flesh] the natural does not ascend to the divine or the supernatural. the bridge is gulfed only by revelation and by the incarnation of jesus christ. salvation therefore is not by man nor by means of man’s politics, or by any other effort of man.[1] [e]ven now those barbarians who have an innate savagery of manners, while they still sacrifice to the idols of their country, are mad against one another, and cannot endure to be a single hour without weapons:but when they hear the teaching of christ, straightway instead of fighting they turn to husbandry, and instead of arming their hands with weapons they raise them in prayer.[2] and jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. (matthew 28:18) the fact that the son of god was manifested in the flesh has far reaching implications. the basic formula of christ as fully god and fully man extends to the way we understand religion and salvation personally and collectively. god speaks to us through the mediator, the man jesus christ (1 tim. 2:5-6, heb. 1:1-2), the word made flesh, and through the written word of the scriptures. any attempt by any individual or group of individuals to present some other path, revelation, method of relating to god, or means of

Article 4 - the ascension and the eternal liturgy by jean corbon o.p.
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the ascension and the eternal liturgy ”the river of life, rising from the throne of god and of the lamb” (rev 22:1), flowed hidden in the passage of the time of the promises and god’s patience. but “when the completion of the time came” (gal 4:4), that is, when the incarnation occurred, the river entered into our world and assumed our flesh. in the “hour” of the cross and the resurrection it sprang forth from the incorruptible and life-giving body of christ. from that moment on it has been and is liturgy. a new period thus began within “the present time” (1) in which after its decisive defeat death carries on its war on all fronts but in which, at the same time, the passage of the lord continues to penetrate the depths of humanity and history. we are in “the last times.” (2) just as the hour of jesus has his cross and his resurrection as inseparable phases, so too the “moment” or “date” (kairos) (3) which begins the “last times” has the lord’s ascension and the outpouring of his spirit as inseparable phases. the relation between the “hour” and this special date or moment is to be looked for not in their chronological succession (to look for it there would be to remain at the level of

Article 5 - the teachings of st. john cassian on praxis and contemplation by alexey fokin
the teachings of st. john cassian on praxis and contemplation by alexey fokin headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! 1. introduction. as is well known, st. john cassian (c. 360-435), known in the byzantine and russian tradition as roman[1], occupies an important place among ascetic writers and theologians of the patristic age. like evagrius of pontus in the east, cassian systematized and popularized eastern asceticism in the west. his ascetic writings made a considerable influence on the development of western ascetic tradition. in this works, cassian managed to combine the experience of eastern christian and western christian asceticism in the era of its development and establishment in the later 4th – early 5th century. his teaching about the order of monastic life, ascetic work and mystical contemplation gained him enduring glory in subsequent centuries[2]. cassian is the author of two fundamental works which have long become the classics of christian ascetical literature translated into many languages: “on the institutes of coenobitic life” (de institutis coenobiorum, в xii volumes)[3] and ‘the conferences’ (collationes)[4]. they were written in circa 420-427[5] in south gaul, presumably in marcel, where st. john became abbot of a monastery to

Article 6 - feast of the sacred heart: christ's heart in ours and ours in christ's
(before it's news) our catholic faith reaches up to heaven, out to our neighbour, and down into the depths of the soul. these three dimensions seem to divide our efforts into three separate tasks, liturgy, love of our neighbour and contemplation, tasks which keep on getting in each other’s way. however, for those who persevere to the end, they are seen to be inseparable, all three being dimensions of any authentically strong relationship with god, all three leading to the same goal and doorways into the same place. in this essay we are going to look at the heart and discover how it connects us to heaven, to earth and to the whole cosmos. we shall then be able to see the relevance of devotion to the sacred heart of jesus. let us start with three quotations from thomas merton. we must begin by frankly admitting that the first place in which to go looking for the world is not outside us but in ourselves. we are the world. in the deepest ground of our being we remain in metaphysical contact with the whole of that creation in which we are only small parts. through our senses and our minds, our loves, needs, and desires, we are implicated, without possibility of evasion, in this world of matter and of men, of things and of persons, which not only affect us and change our lives but are also affected and changed by us…the question, then, is not to speculate about how we are to contact the world

Article 7 - sermon notes: good friday
sermon notes: good friday % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the truth of the cross of christ is: that the fullness of man is less complete than the emptiness of god. st paul reminds us in his letter to the philippians that “jesus emptied himself taking the condition of a slave and being as all men are he accepted death, death on a cross, but god raised him high.” we come to church this good friday to make a simple act of devotion. we come to venerate the cross, to acknowledge the sacrifice that jesus made on our behalf. his emptying of himself, so that we may have life in its fullness. nothing adorns this church today except a stark emptiness. what fills this emptiness in our hearts is the fact that this friday is called “good” because god loves us, he not only tells us, but he shows us and in that love we are redeemed. what is there to be called “good” about this good friday? deep down in the painful parts of our lives there are scars that speak of this truth. it is a dark and painful question that occasionally sneaks out of our mouths, but is so ever present to us. how can there be a god if bad things happen? where is god? why is god silent? how can god allow this or that to happen? affliction is tragic. life can be so unfair? we

Article 1 - up from heathendom
and yet the book is quite filled with the sacred, as was the roman empire of the centuries on either side of the birth of christianity; it was, as has been said by many scholars, ''the religious marketplace of antiquity.'' if you went to the main square in any good-size town in egypt, syria-palestine, asia minor (turkey) or greece -- or in rome itself -- about a.d. 50 you would see on every corner not banks but the hawkers of different religions. ''worship the syrian goddess,'' one would shout, ''she can give sight to the blind.'' another would respond with a still more demanding miracle: ''come to isis, who has granted sight to those born blind.'' ''the great mother,'' she of asia minor, a missionary proclaims, ''grants immortality to those who believe,'' and this, then, is topped again by the isis evangelist, who preaches that isis not only gives the gift of immortality at death but also that of a transformed life, of salvation, in the present. when the armies of alexander the great reached egypt and then further east in the fourth century b.c., the resulting mix of things greek and near eastern was a recipe for spicy new entrees of philosophy and religion -- a religious globalism every bit as revolutionary, and as baffling in its appeals both to yesterday and to tomorrow, as the 20th-century

Article 2 - moving from paralyzing doubt to rock solid assurance
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse every christian i know has struggled, at some point, to feel certain of his or her salvation — including me. we have all walked through a season where terrifying doubt has assailed the blessed assurance we once possessed about our spiritual state. for some of us, ""season of doubt"" isn't strong enough terminology to describe our experience — we've continually questioned the legitimacy of our faith since the moment we began to follow jesus! i think it's biblically safe to say that god wants his children to know they have eternal life (1 john 5:13). he didn't go through all of the trouble of becoming human, suffering his own wrath for our sin, dying, and resurrecting, just so that those for whom he did these things could spend their lives anxiously wondering whether or not they are really his. god is a father to his people, and he wants them to know that they are secure in his love. but how are we to know? how can we know that we are tightly and irreversibly tethered to jesus by the saving love of god? how can we be assured that we have actually been born again and will persevere to the end? the answer to that question varies greatly, depending on whom you ask. if you run in baptist circles, you may be encouraged to remember the day you walked down the aisle and

Article 7 - 'queering john wesley'
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse mark tooley is the president of the institute on religion and democracy (ird). on march 3-4 i attended the wesleyan theological society's annual meeting, featuring scores of distinguished scholars, and gathered this year at asbury seminary in wilmore, kentucky. it was a wonderful experience that highlighted the ongoing vitality of orthodox wesleyan thought. here is my generalizing observation. the more conservative and adamantly orthodox scholars tended to be united methodists who have reacted against their denomination's historic liberalism by more strongly affirming classical wesleyan distinctives. the more liberal scholars often tended to come from historically more conservative evangelical denominations against which they reacted by pressing theological boundaries, sometimes provocatively. the most provocative example was a paper presented in a breakout session called ""queering wesley, queering the church: toward an ecclesial circumcision of the heart."" the author, keegan osinski, describes herself on twitter as the ""church of the nazarene's worst nightmare."" her denomination is an historically conservative church from the wesleyan holiness tradition, which in the late 19th century broke from mainstream methodism's perceived worldliness to pursue a more stringent version of christian life. further self-identified as a ""budding librarian and theologian,"" she is a graduate student at vanderbilt university, which was originally method

Article 8 - jesus’s provocative political protest
christians celebrate jesus’s birth and the immediate events around his crucifixion, but less attention is given to the clearest sign of his political activism, his overturning of the money-changing tables at the temple in jerusalem, the likeliest reason for his execution, as mark manolopoulos explains. by mark manolopoulos all four gospels recall what is euphemistically known as the “temple cleansing”: an outraged jesus overturns the tables of the money-changers. this story has always fascinated me even when i was an unbeliever, even whenever i am an unbeliever. i expect it has a lot to do with the fact that it contrasts sharply with the gentle and peace-loving jesus, the hippie christ. but very recently this classic tale has become particularly poignant, with a renewed relevance and resonance. this article hopes to go some way in explaining why. i proceed by exploring a series of questions. first question: did the temple event actually happen? answer: who knows? if we’re really honest with ourselves, we can’t even be really sure whether jesus existed, let alone whether this “incident” happened. his existence and this particular outburst are certainly possibilities, certainly reasonable possibilities and, today, we are surely open-minded enough to make room for the possible (which may even include the unlikely); in other words, we should no longer privilege the actual over the possible. and so, i myself can’t think of any reason why this christ

Article 1 - u.s. election wrap: clinton polling edge aids dem senate chances
with one day to go, hillary clinton and donald trump are stumping across a total of five battleground states to make their last pitch to voters in a presidential campaign that promises to be groundbreaking no matter who wins. clinton would be first female u.s. commander-in-chief almost a century after american women gained the right to vote; a trump win would mark a historic upset by one of the most controversial nominees in modern history a clinton win would aid democrats’ senate prospects because the vice president casts tie-breaking votes sabato’s crystal ball sees democrats gaining control of senate by picking up 4 senate seats, splitting the chamber 50-50 with republicans but giving democrats tie-breaking power through democrat tim kaine, the vice president (assuming clinton wins) charlie cook, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan cook political report, predicts democrats will make a net gain of at least four senate seats, with gop incumbents defeated in illinois, pennsylvania, wisconsin, new hampshire and democrats holding their seat in nevada cook, speaking sunday on nbc’s meet the press , said he sees republicans keeping their seats in florida and indiana; he declined to make a prediction on senate races in missouri, north carolina the new york times ’ the upshot gives democrats a 56% chance of winning the senate gop favored to keep house, though likely to lose seats cook analyst david wasserman said

Article 2 - investing; a sector strategy, overtaken by events?
when sectors do perform differently, there will not be as much time to take advantage of the trend, he said. periods of significant sector outperformance are likely to be shorter, he said. recently, they have shrunk from several months to only weeks. ''emphasizing stock selection is a better way to make money,'' mr. galbraith said. while sector rotation is still used widely in investment strategies, mr. galbraith is hardly alone in his views. timothy x. ghriskey, who manages $4 billion in value-oriented mutual funds and managed accounts at the dreyfus corporation, said he no longer felt compelled to own a full complement of stocks in the hottest sectors. ''the huge sector momentum market of recent years is very unusual,'' mr. ghriskey said. ''a stock pickers' market is a much more typical market environment.'' robert turner, chairman of turner investment partners in berwyn, pa., says his firm's mutual funds have maintained a sector-neutral approach for years. he views sector investing as an extreme form of market timing. ''timing the market is tough,'' he said. ''but sector rotations are even more difficult to call.'' mr. turner, however, said he and the firm's other portfolio managers had retained considerable latitude to emphasize certain industries. while generally sticking to a market weighting in technology, he said, the funds are overweighting semiconductor and personal-computer stocks and underweighting other kinds of technology shares.

Article 3 - united utilities interim profits improve slightly despite dip in revenue
united utilities interim profits improve slightly despite dip in revenue which companies should you invest in to benefit from the shrinking pound? united utilities has said its profits rose slightly in the first half of the financial year, in line with its previous guidance. the water services provider reported operating profits of £312.5m ($387.7m) for the six months ended 30 september, up from £308.6m in the same period a year earlier. however, revenue dipped slightly to £853m from £857m, with the company blaming an accounting change at its water plus joint venture for the drop. ""overall, we are encouraged by our progress in the early part of this regulatory period,"" united utilities chief executive steve mogford said in a statement. ""we have a robust financial position and are confident that we can deliver our targets for both customers and shareholders.

Article 4 - old houses from canada find a home in washington state
national housing experts said the house relocation project here and another on a nearby island might be the first of their kind. but examples of the innovation that inspired the effort, they said, are easy to find — fueled in many spots around the nation by desperation as homelessness has risen and working-class families have struggled with rising prices and rents, or an inability to find homes at all. photo “things are getting crazy,” said carlos martín, a senior fellow at the urban institute, a research group in washington, d.c. “and when people have got to the point when they have no alternative but to be completely creative, that is when these things happen.” housing advocates in honolulu, for example, are trying to bring back traditional hawaiian frond-woven homes as a less costly alternative to wood and concrete. in many other cities, believers in the tiny-house movement are preaching the virtues, and lower costs, of simplified, stripped-down housing. portland, ore., and berkeley, calif., recently passed ordinances making it easier for a homeowner to build an apartment in the basement or a cottage for rent in the backyard. stricter environmental rules now in effect in british columbia are also making imported homes more appealing and affordable. “you used to be able to take an excavator, crunch a house and take it to the landfill,” said jim connelly, the sales manager for southern vancouver island at nickel brothers, which moves about 100 homes a year on the commercial market

Article 5 - taking a corporate approach to remaking education
''i've never led a revolution before,'' mr. forstmann said. ''but i didn't get here without understanding supply and demand. parents believe the public school government monopoly produces a bad product at a high price. so why are no suppliers rushing forward to cater to them?'' mr. walton, whose family grew wealthy building wal-mart stores in suburbs and rural areas starved for competitively priced goods, argues that when stores do not go into the inner city, it is because the residents lack the buying power to allow the stores to be profitable. but if inner-city parents were given the option of sending their children to a private school with the money that would otherwise go to the local public school, they would have buying power equal to that of suburban parents, mr. walton said. today, the three men will gather with politicians, educators and investors at a conference in manhattan to try to stimulate investment in education. the conference is sponsored by merrill lynch and the children's scholarship fund, the organization co-founded by mr. forstmann and mr. walton, which this year began distributing $200 million in partial private-school scholarships to 40,000 children around the country. clearly some of the interests of these new participants in education lie in profits and politics. mr. doerr, for example, invests heavily in for-profit educational ventures through the new schools venture fund. mr. walton is active in conservative politics, and mr. doerr

Article 6 - whoever wins, vote in mexico will be fateful
''the weight of the past has sometimes been more present than the present itself,'' the author enrique krauze once wrote of mexicans' singular preoccupation with history's legacy, the crucible of conquest and colonialism, reform and revolution that forged their modern outlook. that seemed true during much of the campaign, as the major candidates and their supporters restaged mexico's battles and betrayals. yet at the end of the grand debate, all mexico seemed to grasp the momentous nature of the choice at hand. ''this election is the culmination of struggles, initiatives and sacrifices stretching throughout our entire history,'' porfirio munoz ledo, who ended his candidacy in june to endorse mr. fox, thundered last week. ''never, since we became an independent nation, has power passed peacefully from one party to another through elections. this vote is a watershed.'' in the balloting, voters will elect a president for a six-year term, 500 congressional deputies, 128 senators, two state governors and the mayor of mexico city. in a final opinion poll published by the newspaper reforma on june 22, the governing party candidate, francisco labastida ochoa, was favored by 42 percent of voters, mr. fox of the center-right national action party by 39 percent, and cuauhtemoc cardenas solorzano, a leftist candidate, by 16 percent. the margin of error was 3 percent. those results showed how mexico

Article 7 - markets right now: us bond yields rise after trump win
frankfurt, germany (ap) — the latest on financial markets following the election of donald trump as the next president of the united states (all times local): 2:55 p.m. u.s. bond yields have risen strongly in the wake of trump's victory, a sign that investors think the outlook for the u.s. economy remains positive. the yield, or interest rate, on the u.s.'s ten-year bonds is up 0.08 percentage point at 1.948 percent. that has helped the dollar recover its poise following earlier losses when trump's victory became increasingly likely. the euro, for example, is now basically flat on the day at $1.1025. kathleen brooks, a research director at city index in london, thinks the rise in the yield may represent some optimism over the u.s. economic outlook given republican control of both the white house and congress. that clarity in government, she said, could aid growth. however, she warns that there could be problems ahead if yields continue to rise over the coming days and weeks. if they do, she says ""concern may grow that bonds are selling off due to fears of america's creditworthiness under a president trump."" ___ 2:30 p.m. investors are bracing for a rough day for some health care stocks after the republican victories in tuesday's elections. mizuho securities analyst sheryl skolnick says the trump win and looming gop

- The phrase ""You didn't build that"" was used by President Obama in a 2012 speech.","Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Facebook's fact-checking efforts have been questioned. Research suggests that labeling false information as ""disputed"" may not be enough to prevent misinformation from spreading. A study found that exposure to false information can feel more familiar and lead people to rate it as accurate.

Fusion power is considered a potential breakthrough in energy production, but its development has been hindered by technical challenges. Experts believe that gradual improvements in existing forms of energy, such as photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, are more likely to succeed.

A book titled ""American Girls"" explores the pressure girls face on social media to appear desirable and chaste. The author argues that this pressure is being shaped by new technology and online content.

The Obama-is-a-Muslim rumor has persisted despite being debunked by fact-checkers. This phenomenon illustrates a growing cultural vulnerability to rumors, which can spread quickly through social networks.

A trial in Germany exposed far-right attitudes among some individuals who committed arson against refugees. The case highlights the challenges of tracking anti-immigrant attacks and the need for effective law enforcement.

The legal system often penalizes people for doing what is right, discouraging apologies and settlements. Experts argue that this approach can lead to a lack of accountability and undermine the pursuit of truth.

A book titled ""The Lifespan of a Fact"" explores the tension between fact-checking and conceptual art.

Article 1 - why the fact-checking at facebook needs to be checked
since the 2016 presidential campaign, facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as “disputed.” but how effective are these measures? to date, facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions. but more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts. research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of facebook’s interventions. yale’s gordon pennycook and david rand offer two principal warnings. first, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with tyrone d. cannon. false information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before. this effect persists even when facebook-style warnings label a headline “disputed.” we should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting people’s beliefs. photo in a second paper, mr. pennycook and mr. rand find that the presence of “disputed” labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate — an “implied truth” effect. if facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through

Article 2 - talk to the times: science reporter henry fountain
these discussions will continue in future weeks with other members of the times staff. any breakthroughs in energy production? q. is there some major breakthrough on the horizon which can make a majordifference in the search to reduce the overall part of fossil fuels in the global energy economy? a. dear shalom: thanks for the question. the biggest possible breakthrough in energy production that is on the horizon, i guess, would be fusion power — using the heat released by fusing atomic nuclei to create steam to turn turbines to generate electricity. but fusion power has been on the horizon for a long time already, and we don't seem to be getting much closer to it becoming a practical solution to the world's energy problems. one significant hurdle is figuring out how to contain the energy released so that it can be controlled. fusion reactions (like those in the sun or in a hydrogen bomb) generate temperatures on the order of millions of degrees centigrade. so rather than fusion, i think we're more likely to see continual, gradual improvements in the efficiency of other forms of energy — photovoltaic cells that are able to make use of more of the energy in sunlight, for example, or wind turbines that produce more watts for a given wind speed. the ""smart grid"" idea being talked about these days is really all about efficiency — getting power where it's needed, when it's needed, and not wasting a lot of resources producing powerthat isn't used. conflict over climate change q. i

Article 3 - ‘american girls,’ by nancy jo sales
thirteen-year-old cassy (sales changed her teenage subjects’ names) says boys her age “blackmail” girls for nude pictures: “they say, oh, i have embarrassing pictures of you, if you don’t send nudes i’ll send them all out on social media.” if a girl relents, boys may share the nude picture with others, or post it to an instagram account devoted to such images. says cassy, “everyone winds up having it.” anecdotes like this make a persuasive case that social media has ratcheted up the pressure girls have long faced to appear both desirable and chaste. less clear from “american girls” is what anyone can do about it. well versed in the contemporary literature on social media and adolescence, sales disagrees with those who say adult worries about teenagers and social media stem from “moral panic” or fear of adolescent sexuality in general. “what this point of view fails to acknowledge,” she writes, “are the ways in which the sexual behavior of teenagers actually is being changed and shaped by thoroughly new technology, smartphones and social media, not to mention the influence of online porn. what’s being avoided are the hard questions about whether these behaviors are in fact healthy or abusive or even legal, from the perspective of the age of consent.” advertisement continue reading the main story these are indeed hard questions, but sales provides few satisfying answers. she tells the story of padma, whose facebook pictures showing her in “casual clothes” and

Article 4 - it’s a long story: ‘o.j.: made in america’ seeks your time
now, mr. edelman finds himself, if not in a crowd, certainly not alone. despite a culture of short attention spans, long-story nonfiction filmmaking has become the rage after the critical and commercial successes of hbo’s six-part, 4-hour-45-minute “the jinx,” about robert durst, a wealthy scion accused of killing a friend (among others); and netflix’s 10-part, 10-hour-7-minute “making a murderer,” about steven avery, a wisconsin man accused of a murder after serving 18 years in prison for a wrongful sexual assault conviction. both series were released in 2015 after the equally exalted first season of “serial” in 2014, the nonfiction multi-episodic podcast about the murder of a maryland high school student. there has since been a “deluge” of single-story, immersive projects being pitched, said josh braun, a co-president of submarine, a film sales and production company. but mr. braun, who is shepherding three documentaries that began as features and have been reconceived as series, cautions that most projects “don’t actually have the requisite material that would sustain a four- or six- or 10-part nonfiction series,” he says. “not everything works.” photo the six-part “missing dial,” about a young american adventurer who disappeared in costa rica in 2014, is to begin on the national

photo in the summer of 2004, andy martin, a colorful web columnist and sometime republican candidate for state office, put out a press release announcing his sadness at having to “expose” barack obama as a “muslim who has concealed his religion.” reporters ignored martin’s charge, which offered no proof. but the story took root: martin’s screed bounced about blogs, mutating over the course of a couple years into an e-mail message that suggested the senator is a kind of muslim manchurian candidate for the white house. though news organizations and fact-checking web sites like snopes.com have debunked the claim, the story just won’t die. in an nbc/wall street journal poll taken in december, 8 percent of respondents thought obama was muslim, half as many as correctly identified him as a protestant. the obama-is-a-muslim rumor does not seem to have hurt the candidate’s fortunes, at least not yet. but the myth’s persistence illustrates a growing cultural vulnerability to rumor. journalists typically presume that facts matter: show the public what is true, and they will make decisions correctly. psychologists who study how we separate truth from fiction, however, have demonstrated that the process is not so simple. and because digital technology fosters social networks that are both closely knit and far-flung, rumors are now free to travel widely within certain groups before they meet any opposition from the truth. consider, for starters, this paradox of social

Article 6 - trial in firebombing of refugees exposes far-right grip in germany
turning on the taps is unlikely to cause injury or even death, as arson might, but is just as certain to cause hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage and to keep migrants from being moved in. the first arson case to gain attention nationwide occurred in the northern bavarian village of vorra in december 2014, when someone set fire to a renovated shelter that was about to receive 40 refugees. almost a year later, four refugee families moved into the re-renovated property. but no one was ever arrested for the fire. tracking anti-immigrant attacks is difficult, in part because of germany’s splintered federal system. but the amadeu antonio foundation, a respected nongovernment source, compiles lists culled from news media and police reports nationwide. advertisement continue reading the main story during the week of jan. 24, for instance, it found 10 suspected racist or right-wing assaults, including an arson on jan. 25 that damaged two houses intended for 25 asylum seekers in witten, in north rhine-westphalia. the trial of mr. l. and his friends, which is taking place in the city of hanover, has similarly exposed a worrying attraction to far-right ideas. the men were said in court to have been among the members of an online chat room known as swastika garage. photo several witnesses testified that a favorite pastime for the two men was drinking heavily and listening to right-wing rock bands

Article 7 - filing a heartfelt appeal against the legal system
it is certainly true, for instance, that treating people with respect and acknowledging responsibility is both the decent thing to do and a surprisingly effective way to avoid lawsuits. but the legal system often penalizes and thus discourages doing what is right. the typical automobile insurance policy literally forbids apologizing for an accident. and lawyers, whether paid by the hour or by a percentage of what they recover, have no particular incentive to resolve cases at the outset in exchange for only words. in contested cases, too, many people want simply to be heard. they often prefer a day in court -- ''the ventilation of a public grievance,'' as kafka's joseph k. says in ''the trial'' -- to a private settlement. but the legal system cannot accommodate all of those stories, and lawyers and judges sometimes work hard to make sure they are not heard. trials are heading toward extinction; most cases end in settlements or plea bargains. civil settlements, mr. rosenbaum writes, ''merely serve to silence the story in return for a cashier's check.'' plea bargains are even worse. ''we tolerate the idea of putting people in jail for crimes for which they were willing to plead guilty but which they did not commit,'' he writes. ''truth becomes a hostage to the efficiencies gained from negotiated pleas.'' mr. rosenbaum has no patience for attorney-client privilege, statutes of limitations and rules of evidence that limit the evidence a jury can hear. he disdains legal doctrines that fail

Article 8 - and that’s a fact
to the editor: i would like to have known jennifer b. mcdonald’s take on whether “the lifespan of a fact,” by john d’agata and jim fingal (feb. 26), is a factual work of nonfiction or a ­borgesian hoax. who but a character in a ­borges story spends five (or seven) years diligently fact-checking one 15-page article? did fingal start the process in 2003 or 2005? given that the trail of evidence is there, this fact should be as plain as the difference between purple and pink; perhaps “or” made for a better rhythm . . . or offers us a clue to what’s going on. while i could be wrong, and d’agata might be the misanthropic bully he presents to the world in these exchanges, and fingal the knight-errant, my guess is that they are a couple of clever guys, adhering to the strict rules of conceptual art — or of presidential primaries. p. g. nelson pawtucket, r.i. • to the editor: i was so pleased to see jennifer b. mcdonald take on and take a stand on one of the big issues in contemporary writing, the mixed-up, messed-up mash-up between truth and fiction. the potential for serious damage grows as this approach creeps out from memoir (where maybe you’re sort of entitled to lie about yourself, if not anyone else

Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

Facebook's fact-checking efforts have been questioned. Research suggests that labeling false information as ""disputed"" may not be enough to prevent misinformation from spreading. A study found that exposure to false information can feel more familiar and lead people to rate it as accurate.

Fusion power is considered a potential breakthrough in energy production, but its development has been hindered by technical challenges. Experts believe that gradual improvements in existing forms of energy, such as photovoltaic cells and wind turbines, are more likely to succeed.

A book titled ""American Girls"" explores the pressure girls face on social media to appear desirable and chaste. The author argues that this pressure is being shaped by new technology and online content.

The Obama-is-a-Muslim rumor has persisted despite being debunked by fact-checkers. This phenomenon illustrates a growing cultural vulnerability to rumors, which can spread quickly through social networks.

A trial in Germany exposed far-right attitudes among some individuals who committed arson against refugees. The case highlights the challenges of tracking anti-immigrant attacks and the need for effective law enforcement.

The legal system often penalizes people for doing what is right, discouraging apologies and settlements. Experts argue that this approach can lead to a lack of accountability and undermine the pursuit of truth.

A book titled ""The Lifespan of a Fact"" explores the tension between fact-checking and conceptual art. The authors' use of fact-checking as a creative process has sparked debate

Additionally, the article mentions a specific video titled ""world depopulation"" that is not mentioned in either summary. This suggests that the article is likely FAKE, as it does not align with any of the provided summaries.","The articles discuss various topics related to population control, depopulation agendas, and the impact of immigration on countries. Here's a concise summary:

Agenda 21, launched by the UN in 2015, aims to reduce global population growth through sustainable development goals and targets. However, critics argue that it is a depopulation agenda, promoting family planning and abortion rights.

The radical humanist movement advocates for reducing the world's population, believing it is the root cause of many problems. They promote policies like ""family planning"" and ""abortion rights.""

The 2030 Agenda, also launched by the UN, aims to transform the world by 2030 through sustainable development goals and targets. Critics argue that it is a blueprint for a New World Order (NWO) with the help of the Pope.

Paul Ehrlich's book ""The Population Bomb"" warned about overpopulation in the 1960s, but its predictions were later proven to be exaggerated. However, some experts now warn that the world's population will reach 10 billion by 2050, posing an existential threat.

The US government has been criticized for its handling of immigration, particularly with regards to DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Some argue that stopping all immigration is necessary to address population growth and resource management issues.

UN Agenda 21 aims to reduce global population growth through sustainable development goals and targets. However, critics argue that it is a depopulation agenda, promoting family planning and abortion rights.

The Irish government has welcomed Bill Gates to Dublin to discuss development aid priorities for Ireland's EU presidency. Gates' foundation has promoted policies aimed at reducing poverty and hunger worldwide.

Overall, the articles highlight concerns about population control, depopulation agendas, and the impact of immigration on countries. They also raise questions about the role of governments and international organizations in addressing these issues.","The articles discuss various topics, including the decline of traditional media, disruption and leadership, aging populations, election forecasts, and cultural trends.

Traditional media is facing significant challenges, with employment in communications declining by 60,000 jobs in New York since 2000. The Washington Post's domestic bureaus are also closing. Marcus Brauchli, Executive Editor, stated that the organization is not a national news organization serving a general audience.

Dominic Barton, Global Managing Director of McKinsey, discussed disruption and leadership. He emphasized the importance of adapting to change and developing future-oriented skills. Barton shared his personal experience of being rejected three times before becoming a partner at McKinsey.

AARP aims to show marketers what they are missing in overlooking the consumer over 50. Ken Dychtwald, President of Age Wave, noted that he drives an Aston Martin and wears a Cartier watch, highlighting the differences between younger and older generations.

A recent poll found that young Americans lean slightly more to the left than the general population. They are more likely to support gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and universal healthcare.

The US population is expected to continue growing due to immigration, despite concerns about its impact on resources and infrastructure. Christopher Edwards argued that the benefits of immigration must be weighed against these concerns.

Election forecasts suggest that President-elect Donald Trump may face significant international challenges, including the North Korean nuclear threat and the collapse of Venezuela. Global intelligence specialists discussed potential scenarios and international incidents that could arise under a Trump presidency.

The article ""Generation Nice"" explores the cultural trends surrounding millennials. While some portray them as narcissistic, a Pew Research Center report suggests that this stereotype is not accurate. Millennials are more likely to be engaged in social causes and activism than previously thought.

Finally, the article ""The Idea Was Not to Have a New One"" discusses the lack of meaningful art produced during the 9/11 era. Instead, there was a fascination with mortality, forensics, and autopsies, as well as a focus on violence and sex in media.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

(and it’s not just manhattan-centric endeavors. published ambition has been diminished by new realities elsewhere, most recently in the announced closing of the washington post’s remaining domestic bureaus. last week, in an interview with howard kurtz, the executive editor, marcus brauchli, said it plainly: “we are not a national news organization of record serving a general audience.” yeow.) that feeling of age, of a coming sunset, is tough to avoid in all corners of traditional publishing. earlier in november, the new york comptroller said that employment in communications in new york had lost 60,000 jobs since 2000, a year when the media industry here seemed at the height of its powers. i arrived in new york that same year as part of inside.com, a digital news site conceived to cover a media space that was converging and morphing into something wholly new. the site covered the mainstream media’s efforts to come to grips with new realities and efforts by new players to cash in on emerging technology. few of us could have conceived that in the next decade some of the reigning titans of media would be routed. profligate dot-com ad money that had fattened print went away in a digital wipeout, and when digital media came back, it was to dine on the mainstream media rather than engorge it. after 2000, jobs in traditional media industries declined at a rate of about 2.5 percent annually and then went into a

Article 4 - young americans are leaning left, new poll finds
at a time when democrats have made gains after years in which republicans have dominated washington, young americans appear to lean slightly more to the left than the general population: 28 percent described themselves as liberal, compared with 20 percent of the nation at large. and 27 percent called themselves conservative, compared with 32 percent of the general public. forty-four percent said they believed that same-sex couples should be permitted to get married, compared with 28 percent of the public at large. they are more likely than their elders to support the legalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana. the findings on gay marriage were reminiscent of an exit poll on election day 2004: 41 percent of 18-to-29-year-old voters said gay couples should be permitted to legally marry, according to the exit poll. in the current poll, 62 percent said they would support a universal, government-sponsored national health care insurance program; 47 percent of the general public holds that view. and 30 percent said that “americans should always welcome new immigrants,” while 24 percent of the general public holds that view. their views on abortion mirror those of the public at large: 24 percent said it should not be permitted at all, while 38 percent said it should be made available but with greater restrictions. thirty-seven percent said it should be generally available. in one potential sign of shifting attitudes, respondents, by overwhelming margins, said they believed that the nation was prepared to elect

while the united states benefits in certain respects from immigration and population growth, and as the united states population would still be growing even if immigration were significantly reduced, the benefits of immigration must be weighed against these concerns, which are shared by americans of many political views and backgrounds. christopher s. edwards new york, oct. 12, 2006  to the editor: i agree wholeheartedly with your editorial criticizing patrick buchanan’s fear-mongering regarding immigration. but your statement that “our population issues have mysterious ways of working themselves out” is a dangerous oversimplification. it can’t be denied that many of the predictions of the 1968 book “the population bomb” have been disproved with the passage of time. its author, paul r. ehrlich, certainly didn’t foresee surprising developments like declining populations in some technologically advanced nations. but it is also true that most of the serious problems facing humankind are exacerbated or directly caused by exponential population growth. these range from dire environmental degradation to increased human misery from causes such as severe water shortages and, yes, famine. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later.

american intelligence officials are used to forecasting how foreign elections will affect the united states. but whatever would foreign prognosticators make of hillary clinton, donald trump, and the world of november 9 and beyond? we asked some of the smartest spies and analysts we know to turn the tables and imagine they were the national intelligence council dissecting the 2016 election as if the united states were a foreign country. what are the global scenarios or surprising international incidents a president clinton could face—or precipitate? how would america’s role in the world be different from what we’ve seen under president obama? and what happens if donald trump pulls off a win? story continued below on october 25, these four global intelligence specialists—including former nic and cia officials—gathered for a forecasting exercise moderated by politico editor susan glasser. while trump was talking about a “rigged” election and clinton was making a push into red states, the group cast their eyes toward serious international challenges that have largely been ignored on the campaign trail: from the north korean nuclear threat to the future of europe post-brexit, vladimir putin’s designs on the middle east to the collapse of venezuela—and more. here’s the conversation they had, condensed and lightly edited. *** susan glasser: it seems like people are already turning their attention, in many ways, to november 9 and beyond. but everybody feels intuitively that this election is not

4. “elyria is disengaged and depleted in a manner that put me in mind of the characters in the novels of tao lin, that zen summoner of millennial ennui.” why this microscopic attention paid to a generation whose oldest members are only now entering the prime of their adult lives? one answer is that millennials, the first people to come of age in the 21st century, with its dizzying rate of technological change, have been forced to invent new ways of navigating it. but first, what besides youth sets millennials apart from their elders — the wizened silent generation, the graying boomers, the midlife gen-x’ers? the usual answer seems to be “narcissism” — self-absorption indulged to comical extremes. we all can recite the evidence: the breathlessly updated facebook profile, the cascade of selfies, the kardashians. millennials know this litany, too. “people have been calling me a narcissist since i was 3,” says hannah, the character lena dunham plays in “girls,” her comedy of millennial manners. it’s a small joke on hannah but a bigger one on the anxious, hovering adults who supplied the clucking soundtrack when she was growing up. advertisement continue reading the main story but a very different picture of millennials emerges from what may be the most illuminating literary project of our era, the pew research center’s sequence of reports on millennials. the 

Article 8 - the idea was not to have a new one
in the past, hard times and historical uncertainties have often galvanized the artistic imagination -- think of the literature produced during the 1970's and 80's in latin america, eastern europe and south africa. in the case of millennial america, it's too soon to tell what the long-term effects will be, but thus far, the cultural fallout from sept. 11 has ranged from the negligible to the tacky. certainly, the ''new normal'' didn't make for kinder, gentler, higher-minded art, as so many predicted. a new fascination with mortality surfaced -- in novels like ''the lovely bones'' and movies like ''solaris'' -- but it tended to manifest itself most visibly in a grisly interest in forensics and autopsies (''c.s.i.,'' ''c.s.i. miami'' and ''crossing jordan''). sales of violent video games like ''grand theft auto'' boomed, and sexual exhibitionism turned back the clock on women: prostitutes and their johns vamped before hidden video cameras on hbo's ''cathouse''; rolling stone made a habit of putting half-naked cheesecake shots of young singers and actresses on its covers; and even the new barbie donned navel-baring britneyesque togs. if people were worried about terrorism, a possible war with iraq and the specter of smallpox attacks, they weren't showing it. in front of television

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various topics related to population control, depopulation agendas, and the impact of immigration on countries. Here's a concise summary:

Agenda 21, launched by the UN in 2015, aims to reduce global population growth through sustainable development goals and targets. However, critics argue that it is a depopulation agenda, promoting family planning and abortion rights.

The radical humanist movement advocates for reducing the world's population, believing it is the root cause of many problems. They promote policies like ""family planning"" and ""abortion rights.""

The 2030 Agenda, also launched by the UN, aims to transform the world by 2030 through sustainable development goals and targets. Critics argue that it is a blueprint for a New World Order (NWO) with the help of the Pope.

Paul Ehrlich's book ""The Population Bomb"" warned about overpopulation in the 1960s, but its predictions were later proven to be exaggerated. However, some experts now warn that the world's population will reach 10 billion by 2050, posing an existential threat.

The US government has been criticized for its handling of immigration, particularly with regards to DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Some argue that stopping all immigration is necessary to address population growth and resource management issues.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY

The articles discuss various topics, including the decline of traditional media, disruption and leadership, aging populations, election forecasts, and cultural trends.

Traditional media is facing significant challenges, with employment in communications declining by 60,000 jobs in New York since 2000. The Washington Post's domestic bureaus are also closing. Marcus Brauchli, Executive Editor, stated that the organization is not a national news organization serving a general audience.

Dominic Barton, Global Managing Director of McKinsey, discussed disruption and leadership. He emphasized the importance of adapting to change and developing future-oriented skills. Barton shared his personal experience of being rejected three times before becoming a partner at McKinsey.

AARP aims to show marketers what they are missing in overlooking the consumer over 50. Ken Dychtwald, President of Age Wave, noted that he drives an Aston Martin and wears a Cartier watch, highlighting the differences between younger and older generations.

A recent poll found that young Americans lean slightly more to the left than the general population. They are more likely to support gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and universal healthcare.

The US population is expected to continue growing due to immigration, despite concerns about its impact on resources and infrastructure. Christopher Edwards argued that the benefits of immigration must be weighed against these concerns.

Election forecasts suggest that President-elect Donald Trump may face significant international challenges, including the North Korean nuclear threat and the collapse of Venezuela. Global intelligence specialists discussed potential scenarios and international incidents that could arise under a Trump

The article discusses the themes of redesign mania, branding, and the impact of technological advancements on American democracy, which are all mentioned in the reliable summary. Additionally, the article mentions specific events, such as the 2016 US presidential election and President Obama's congratulatory message to President-elect Trump, which are accurately reflected in the reliable summary. The only discrepancy is that the article does not mention the ""deep state"" or the economy collapse, but these topics are not central to the article's main themes. Overall, the article appears to be a genuine analysis of the redesign mania and its implications for American society.","The articles discuss various topics related to the Trump-Clinton debate, the economy, and the deep state. Here's a concise summary of the facts:

**Economy:**

* The US economy is experiencing a ""collapse of the 'everything bubble'"" (Article 3), with signs of slowing growth, including declining business lending, core retail sales, and industrial production.
* The S&P 500 index has increased by 12% since November 8, but this century's third great bubble is likely numbered.

**Deep State:**

* The deep state maintains its influence despite Trump's presidency (Article 4), with some speculating that he may be an integral component of the elitist fraternity controlling the system.
* Trump's cabinet appointments have been met with criticism from some, but others argue that they are talented and accomplished individuals.

**Media and Politics:**

* The media has been criticized for its bias against Trump, with some outlets labeling him as a ""fake news"" threat (Article 2).
* Trump has used Twitter to convey his message to supporters, often frustrating liberals and foiling their plans.
* The left has reacted negatively to Trump's presidency, with some supporters experiencing emotional distress.

**Other Topics:**

* Melania Trump's first official portrait was released, revealing a subtle difference in her expression (Article 5).
* A camera caught Bill Clinton behind Melania's back, leading to speculation about Hillary Clinton's behavior (Article 7).

Overall, the articles highlight the complexities and challenges of the Trump presidency, including economic concerns, deep state influence, media bias, and emotional reactions from supporters.","The transition from Obama to Trump was marked by controversy, with President Obama urging a smooth transition and President-elect Trump's team being described as ""disarrayed"" and ""nepotistic."" Hillary Clinton conceded the election, stating that it would be ""painful for a long time,"" while President Obama congratulated Trump and invited him to meet at the White House.

The 2016 US presidential election was seen as a shocking turn of events, with many in the American establishment reeling from the outcome. The election highlighted issues such as climate change, social media's impact on politics, and the future of surveillance.

Donald Trump's victory was attributed to his personal grievance-driven campaign, which targeted politicians, business rivals, and the media elite. His opponents, including Hillary Clinton, were seen as having underestimated him.

Experts predicted that a Trump presidency would have significant international implications, including increased tensions with North Korea, a reevaluation of Europe post-Brexit, and potential conflicts in the Middle East.

The long-term environmental impact of short-term politics was also highlighted, with climate change being described as humanity's greatest challenge. The 2015 Paris Agreement may be the last chance to address this issue.

Failed presidential candidates often experience a sense of loss akin to a death in the family, and those who have endured such experiences include Hubert Humphrey, who advised Bob Dole on coping with defeat after the 1976 election.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

“before they exchange blows”: economic facts americans should remember in trump-clinton debate % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) this article was written by michael snyder and originally published at his economic collapse blog. editor’s comment: this debate will be about the epic clash of personalities, and the dramatic fight to the death between the old establishment hacks – epitomized by the corrupt and crumbling hillary – and the swarms of angry americans seeking ‘real change’ through the body politic. hopefully, somewhere in the showdown for democracy, or whatever one wants to bill it, there will be something tangible or even articulately promising about the future of the american people, who have been economically shafted and continuously denied representation in government that gives away everything to the globalist system of domination. if anything good ever comes out of the lousy, phony and empty presidential election dog-and-pony show, it will be something to stop the bleeding. trump’s rhetoric has been built around this, and if he were to deliver, it would be important. hillary waffles lightly on her supposed-opposition to the trans-pacific partnership, and occasional regrets about nafta, despite a solid career of undermining the american working force and facilitation of overseas sell-offs of industry, infrastructure and economic advantage. with the impact of the 2008 collapse, and darker clouds still ahead, this election, past the unforgettable faces of professional

fake news: they’re just scared that trump means they lose power (before it's news) we keep hearing about “fake news” and how all these businesses that backed hillary clinton are going to save us from this horrible menace. of course the real goal is to silence dissent. now that donald trump won, they’re worried they’re losing control over what you read. first lady hillary rodham clinton sails alongside former cbs newsman walter cronkite during an outing on cronkite’s sailboat near edgartown, mass. tuesday, aug. 25, 1998. the first family ventured out together for the first time since arriving in martha’s vineyard for vacation august 18. (ap photo/stephan savoia) note the above photo. then-first lady hillary clinton on a sailboat with walter cronkite. this kind of cozy relationship between big media stars, and big democrat party stars, has been around for a long time. before the internet, they were in total control of the news. even in the internet era though, they were mostly in control. the mighty drudge report was mostly just repeating stories that were initially investigated by big media outlets. but now an entire media world has been established in opposition to them. redstate, townhall, the daily caller, and yes even breitbart don’t just promote their own ideas, but will openly oppose the left-wing “consensus”

Article 4 - the deep state in the age of trump
(before it's news) politics as usual, especially the party version of republicans and democrats is the latest endangered species to hit the bone yards of extinction. now, that does not mean that competing power factions have all merged into a collegial stew of some imaginable melting pot. no the literal power behind the government that embeds the deepest recess of manipulated reality still maintains and uses their influence and coercion force to remain in control. what actual effect donald trump will have to break the connections that keeps the deep state in charge can only be judged with the passage of time. some contend that trump is actually an integral component of an elitist fraternity of financial magnates that sit at the table of the deep state. well, assessing the appointees to his cabinet concludes that talented and accomplished achievers often have accumulated great wealth. those who condemn capable people, out of hand, because of their money acumen are fools who reside in their fantasy theories. much like the 68 house democrats, who boycotted the trump inauguration, their irrelevancy in the actual mix of shaping world affairs approaches the insignificance and lack of credibility from the corporatist mass media. in the era of trump america first, how will divergent cliques and kindred insiders react, respond or cooperate with the new sheriff in town? the strange concept of conducting affairs in a beneficial national interest has not been tried in well over a century. so when the hill reported that the trump team prepares dramatic cuts “overall,

the transition from obama to trump nov. 17, 2016 credit hilary swift for the new york times to the editor: re “ trump takes to twitter in defense of transition ” (news article, nov. 17): on nov. 10, president obama told president-elect donald trump, “if you succeed, then the country succeeds.” with all due respect, mr. president, that is entirely wrong. virtually every item on the trump administration’s to-do list makes the country weaker, from the gutting of environmental and financial regulation, to the destabilization of international security treaties, to reducing access to health care, to the terrorization of young people working and studying under deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca. more to the point, the stunning disarray, nepotism, score-settling and incompetence of the trump transition effort make clear that your administration will not be “assisting” a transition. you will be the ones making the transition happen. history and the national interest may demand that you not be obstructionist. but nothing requires a more positive effort in the transition, except for national security. the courtesy of president bush toward you is not the same: your teams met with his, as professionals in government, albeit with policy differences. instructing islamophobic kooks, white supremacists and oil industry hacks in how better to degrade america is something else entirely. advertisement berkeley, calif. to the editor: this is just too

Title: editor’s letter: make it new
Content: a little-known fact about the is that it is printed on the weekend before the one on which it is distributed. this means that the contents of this week’s issue were finalized several days before election day. you will find no direct reflections on the results of the voting in these articles. and yet, the uncertainty of the outcome at the time we published them suits the theme of this special issue: our current mania with redesigning, tweaking, optimizing, improving, refreshing and updating everything. in the age of branding, the quadrennial choosing of an american president has come to feel like an exercise in product relaunch, and both candidates — hillary clinton and the eventual victor, donald trump — each represented a new and unprecedented proposal for the face we would show the world. the conviction that things can be eternally improved is fundamental to american democracy. in every election, at every level of government, candidates criticize the incumbent, rail against the status quo and promise that they can do better. a similar zeal has always been a feature of our consumer culture, and in recent years technological advances have only intensified our belief that all things can and should be regularly revolutionized. the spread of silicon valley’s ethos of disruption has emboldened (some might say to a lamentable degree) creative types in all sectors to blow up all the standard operating procedures. in the world of product design, the ease with which any electronic gadget can be turned into a node in a network of information, conspiring to make life easier at every juncture, has led us to imagine a whole new dimension to our most quotidian objects. why sell a mere refrigerator when you can sell a smart refrigerator that adds a line to your grocery list when the milk runs out? in this issue we examine the pros and cons of this redesign mania, charting its path from corporate logos to home furnishings to public spaces to social services and more. we even caught the fever ourselves: working with paola antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at the museum of modern art, we commissioned six designers around the world to reimagine objects that we felt could be improved, from the baggage-claim carousel to the hospital gown to the toilet. no design is ever permanent but merely a way station between what a thing used to be and what it might yet become — a source of consolation, perhaps, if your wished-for presidential redesign did not prevail in this past week’s contest. jake silverstein is editor in chief of the magazine. a version of this article appears in print on november 13, 2016, on page mm22 of the sunday magazine with the headline: make it new. today's paper | subscribe

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The transition from Obama to Trump was marked by controversy, with President Obama urging a smooth transition and President-elect Trump's team being described as ""disarrayed"" and ""nepotistic."" Hillary Clinton conceded the election, stating that it would be ""painful for a long time,"" while President Obama congratulated Trump and invited him to meet at the White House.

The 2016 US presidential election was seen as a shocking turn of events, with many in the American establishment reeling from the outcome. The election highlighted issues such as climate change, social media's impact on politics, and the future of surveillance.

Donald Trump's victory was attributed to his personal grievance-driven campaign, which targeted politicians, business rivals, and the media elite. His opponents, including Hillary Clinton, were seen as having underestimated him.

Experts predicted that a Trump presidency would have significant international implications, including increased tensions with North Korea, a reevaluation of Europe post-Brexit, and potential conflicts in the Middle East.

The long-term environmental impact of short-term politics was also highlighted, with climate change being described as humanity's greatest challenge. The 2015 Paris Agreement may be the last chance to address this issue.

Failed presidential candidates often experience a sense of loss akin to a death in the family, and those who have endured such experiences include Hubert Humphrey, who advised Bob Dole on coping with defeat after the 1976 election.

Article 1 - cecile richards on her life after planned parenthood
“as a lifetime organizer, i’ve never been more excited, despite this congress and this presidency,” she said in the first interview in which she confirmed and discussed her departure. “there’s this kind of organic activism by women.” her refrain that planned parenthood is apolitical will strike some as laughable. depending on whom you ask, the elegant 60-year-old is a national “hero” or a “deeply evil woman” and “mass murderer.” ms. richards, the elder daughter of ann richards, the former governor of texas who died in 2006, became a household name in 2015, when an anti-abortion group released several secretly recorded videos of abortion providers discussing selling fetal tissue to researchers. ms. richards testified to congressional republicans who wanted to strip the group of its estimated $450 million in annual federal funding. “she has really helped put a face on the position,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington, adding that ms. richards was “unfazed by the horrendous, awful, negative attacks.” photo on the contrary, ms. richards seemed to relish her role as the consummate rabble-rouser to republicans. she was practically giddy relaying the time she visited a planned parenthood clinic in kenosha, wis., in the district represented by paul d. ryan, the republican speaker of the house. but the work, and her visibility, had a dark side.

Article 2 - how planned parenthood could still profit from dead babies
(photo: reuters/gary cameron) planned parenthood federation president cecile richards testifies before the house committee on oversight and government reform on capitol hill in washington september 29, 2015. (via liveactionnews.org) planned parenthood president cecile richards informed the national institutes of health that the abortion giant would no longer ""accept reimbursement"" for baby body parts harvested during and after abortions. while she wrote that one basis of this decision was to ""expose our opponents' false charges about this limited but important work,"" the very decision itself demonstrates that the charge is anything but false. an ""ethical"" organization does not need to change policy if it ""adheres to the highest legal, medical, and ethical standards."" what is there to change? as representative diane black said, in response to richards' letter: ""it is curious that, while planned parenthood officials maintain there has been no wrongdoing, they still find it necessary to change their policy following the recent undercover videos. clearly, this was a decision motivated by optics rather than the organization's conscience. if planned parenthood truly wanted to confront its growing scandal, it would stop aborting more than 327,000 innocent lives each year and fully commit to true women's health care…in light of this news, i suppose doctor mary gatter will have to find another way to get her lamborghini, but rest assured – this development does not change my conviction that planned parenthood

Article 3 - partisans adopt deceit as a tactic for reports
senator jim demint, republican of south carolina, has limited his comments to calling for an end to federal financing for npr. representative eric cantor of virginia, the republican majority leader, issued a statement saying, “this video clearly highlights the fact that public broadcasting doesn’t need taxpayer funding to thrive.” representative doug lamborn, republican of colorado, also cited the o’keefe video specifically in talking to the daily caller about cutting funding for public broadcasting. “their arrogance and condescension,” he said, is “just amazing.” none of the three mentioned mr. o’keefe by name. when asked about mr. o’keefe’s tactics, a spokeswoman for mr. cantor was circumspect: “congressman cantor has been working to find ways to cut spending so that people can go back to work.” political strategists express worry that this sort activity has been creeping into campaigns for some time now. but the fact that they can so often have a political benefit leaves many torn. “i find the whole thing bordering on unsavory on both sides,” said ari fleischer, a white house press secretary under president george w. bush. “as much as i love it when liberal hypocrisy is exposed,” he added, “do we really want to get to the point where it becomes standard fare — especially in political campaigns — for opponents to engage in sting operations?” photo defensible or not, use of the

Article 4 - congress looks to defund planned parenthood after explosive undercover videos
legislation has been introduced in both the house and senate that would prevent the federal government from giving the controversial abortion-giant planned parenthood any taxpayer funds for a period of one year, unless the organization can assure the money will not be used to perform abortions. rep. diane black, r-tenn., introduced the defund planned parenthood act of 2015 in the house tuesday, while sen. james lankford, r-okla., introduced the same measure in the senate wednesday afternoon. the house bill has 80 original co-sponsors, while lankford is still gathering senate co-sponsors. the bills also make clear that if planned parenthood is given funds on the grounds that it won't be used for abortions and actually uses federal funds for abortions in cases other than rape, incest or to save the mother's life, the secretary of health and human services and the secretary of agriculture are responsible for seeking repayment from the organization. the hyde amendment, which is renewed every year, bans the use of federal funds to cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest and to save the mother's life. as planned parenthood receives over $$500 million per year in federal funding, the organization has stated that it does not spend federal funds on abortions and it keeps its federal funds separate. however, a 2015 government accountability office report states that the organization uses taxpayer dollars to advocate for abortions. some conservatives argue that the federal money given to planned parenthood and

Article 2 - what a “real christian” said about jews
what a “real christian” said about jews headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! jefferson on judaism: the untold story although the beloved author of the declaration of independence, thomas jefferson, was a firm advocate for religious liberty in america for jews and all people, what has been carefully censored from the history books is the absolute fact that jefferson clearly considered the jewish religion itself to be quite abominable. writing to john adams on oct. 13, 1813, the widely read intellectual commented on the talmud and other jewish teachings: “what a wretched depravity of sentiment and manners must have prevailed before such corrupt maxims could have obtained credit! it is impossible to collect from these writings a consistent series of moral doctrine.” describing himself as “a real christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of jesus,” jefferson wrote towilliam short (on oct. 31, 1819) that he considered jesus“the greatest of all the reformers of the depraved religion of his own country,” adding in a subsequent letter to short (aug. 4, 1820) that while christ preached “philanthropy and universal charity and benevolence,” the jews followed teachings that instilled in them “the most anti-social spirit towards other nations.” jefferson wrote that jesus—as a “reformer of the superst

Article 3 - midseason report card
midseason report card (before it's news) pretty good season so far. that’s the kind of cutting insight you’ve come to expect, i know. maybe i’m just speechless, because if you’d offered 3-3 before the season began, i’d've taken it.** four wins offers a lot of hope, as does the rest of the acc itself. a lot has gone right to make that happen. the halfway-point bye week is a perfect time to take stock. for no other reason than i feel like it, we’ll do a basic report card and grade the team a to f. small spoiler: nobody gets an f. passing grades for all, which we certainly wouldn’t have said after 12 games last season. **in the sense of trying to maximize our wins, that is. 3-3 actually would’ve been more likely to put us on a path for a middle-of-the-road season, which as we know is really the worst case. either let’s have a really good season or let’s have a coaching change, as you know. quarterbacks grade: b- i’ve been very anti-platoon, for the most part, but truth is, i think this one’s over once greyson lambert is healthy. the reason i have to qualify that is because matt johns hasn’t played like a guy just keeping the seat warm. both these guys are redshirt sophomores, and let’s not get carried away, they’re

the mindblog queue: moral responsibility; evolution of music; booze and hypnosis (before it's news) during this period of relative inactivity for mindblog, while i am pursuing other projects, i still accumulate references to work that looks interesting. rather than letting them disappear into the list of potential posts that has accumulated by now to 50 pages of links, i’m going to post some of the links, with minimal descriptions, to make it possible for readers who find a favorite topic to click their way to the source. did your brain make you do it? neuroscience and moral responsibility. “naïve dualism” is the belief that acts are brought about either by intentions or by the physical laws that govern our brains and that those two types of causes — psychological and biological — are categorically distinct. people are responsible for actions resulting from one but not the other. (in citing neuroscience, the supreme court may have been guilty of naïve dualism: did it really need brain evidence to conclude that adolescents are immature?)…naïve dualism is misguided. “was the cause psychological or biological?” is the wrong question when assigning responsibility for an action. all psychological states are also biological ones. a better question is “how strong was the relation between the cause (whatever it happened to be) and the effect?” if, hypothetically, only 1 percent of people with a brain malfunction (or a history of being abused) commit violence, ordinary considerations about blame would still seem

The article also mentions the implications of the ruling for healthcare reform and the potential impact on November's election. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains inaccuracies, such as Chief Justice John Roberts joining the four left-leaning justices, which is not supported by the article. Additionally, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY implies that the court upheld nearly all of President Obama's health care overhaul, whereas the article notes that the ruling imposes limits on Congress' power and sets the stakes for November's election. Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY provides a more accurate representation of the article's content.","The US Supreme Court upheld nearly all of President Obama's health care overhaul, including the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance. The 5-4 decision was a victory for the president and ensured his signature domestic policy achievement remains mostly intact.

Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four left-leaning justices on the bench in crafting the majority decision. He ruled that the mandate could not be upheld under the commerce clause but could be upheld under the government's power to tax.

The court also upheld the Medicaid expansion, but found it unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions. The decision sets the stakes for November's election and has significant implications for healthcare reform.

The ruling rejected Obama's unprecedented argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress' power ""to regulate commerce among the several states."" The court held that the mandate violates the commerce clause, but found it constitutional as a tax.

The decision also affects Florida seniors, with the Supreme Court upholding a massive tax increase and Medicare cuts on them. The ruling makes clear what is at stake in November's election, with Republicans vowing to repeal the law if elected.","The articles discuss various tax-related topics in the US. 

A recent House of Representatives bill would exempt over 99.5% of estates from tax, slash tax rates on the rest, and cost $760 billion during its first decade. The bill's passage is seen as a compromise to pass a top priority for big-shot constituents before the November elections.

The Supreme Court effectively created a new tax by calling the penalty for not buying health insurance a ""tax."" This decision led some opponents of the healthcare law to claim it was a large tax increase, despite sponsors' denials.

A New York Times/CBS News poll found that nearly 70% of Americans believe congressional Republicans favor the rich and oppose lowering taxes for large corporations. Two-thirds want wealth distributed more evenly, while a similar share wants to increase taxes on millionaires.

The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve a bill repealing a 3% excise tax on phone bills, which costs households $50 per year.

Some states are competing to shield the wealth of the 1%. Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, and Alaska have passed laws to attract trust business, while other states like New Hampshire and Ohio also aim to do so.

President Obama stated that he will insist on a tax increase for those making over $250,000 per year. Speaker John A. Boehner supports continuing Bush-era tax cuts but favors closing loopholes and limiting deductions.

More cities are passing soda taxes on sugary drinks, with San Francisco, Oakland, Boulder, and Philadelphia expected to approve measures. The taxes aim to discourage people from consuming high-calorie drinks.

Senator Rand Paul's flat-tax reform plan would replace the federal tax system with a 14.5% flat tax rate, except for income exempted by retaining popular write-offs.

Article 2 - federal district judge rejects motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of health care reform
federal district judge rejects motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of health care reform (before it's news) judge roger vinson of the northern district of florida became the second judge to reject the united states’ motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of the health care reform legislation. like judge hudson of the eastern district of virginia (and unlike judge steeh of the eastern district of michigan, who granted a motion to dismiss), judge vinson ruled that the claim that the individual mandate exceeds congress’s powers under the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause was at a minimum plausible. pointing to language from the congressional budget office and congressional research service noting the novelty of a congressional requirement by congress that individuals purchase a particular good or service, judge vinson noted: “while the novel and unprecedented nature of the individual mandate does not automatically render it unconstitutional, there is perhaps a presumption that it is. in printz, the supreme court stated several times that an ‘absence of power’ to do something could be inferred because congress had never made an attempt to exercise that power before.” judge vinson also rejected the argument that the mandate with its accompanying penalty should be understood to be a tax and is a permissible exercise of congress’s taxing power, noting that both the president and congress went way out of their way to make sure it was not characterized as a tax. finally judge vinson also ruled that a challenge arguing that the new costs the states would incur under the revisions to

Article 3 - the new york times finally catches up to redstate on the obamacare tax!
the new york times finally catches up to redstate on the obamacare tax! (before it's news) the new york times deigned just now to explain an awkward situation about obamacare to their readers. to wit: there are many people who have looked at the penalty for not getting insurance and realized that fine for not paying it is considerably lower than the cost of getting even the cheapest plan on the obamacare exchanges (particularly when you factor in rising deductibles, which is something that most obamacare boosters refuse to do*). so those people have opted out of obamacare, which is worrying the folks running obamacare, because opting out was supposed to be something that a few cranks did, not possibly up to ten million people or so. yes, i know that this sounds familiar to redstate readers: we’ve been saying this ever since obamacare got revved up. the situation hasn’t really improved, either – but that isn’t the point. the point is apparently that the nyt is taking the opportunity granted them by the new year to explain some very unpleasant truths to its readership. one of which being: the wonderfully optimistic plan where everybody would be gently nudged into going onto obamacare because of, gasp, a fine did not crash and burn so much as simply spontaneously combust, and before said plan ever even left the hangar. as many people have said before: it turns out americans actually can do math. go figure… …sorry. note

Article 4 - liberals can thank george w. bush for passing obamacare
(before it's news) the supreme court on thursday upheld nearly all of president obama’s health care overhaul, in a landmark ruling that will have sweeping consequences for the economy, the election and america’s health care system. in a 5-4 decision, the court ruled as constitutional the so-called individual mandate requiring most americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014. the ruling is a victory for the president, ensuring for now that his signature domestic policy achievement remains mostly intact. it also ensures that the law will play a prominent role in the general election campaign, as republican candidate mitt romney vows to repeal the law if elected. obama is expected to speak publicly about the ruling later in the day. chief justice john roberts, who was appointed during a republican administration, joined the four left-leaning justices on the bench in crafting the majority decision. “the affordable health care act survives largely unscathed,” justice ruth bader ginsburg, one of those justices, declared at the end of the reading, claiming the “setbacks” going forward will be “temporary blips, not permanent obstructions.” the ruling relied on a technical explanation of how the individual mandate could be categorized. roberts, in the opinion, said the mandate could not be upheld under the constitution’s commerce clause. however, it could be upheld under the government’s power to tax. “the affordable care act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part the individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise

Article 5 - supreme court rejects obama’s commerce clause arguments, upholds obamacare anyway under tax and spend clause
(before it's news) chief justice john roberts’ majority decision today upholding the patient protection and affordable care act makes a number of very important points. first, roberts completely rejected the obama administration’s unprecedented argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under congress’ power “to regulate commerce…among the several states.” as roberts wrote: the constitution grants congress the power to “regulate commerce.” art. i, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). the power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. if the power to “regulate” something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the constitution would be superfluous…. our precedent also reflects this understanding. as expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: they uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.” it is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them…. the individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. it instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce. construing the commerce clause to permit congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. that’s important. when you also count the four dissenters (justices kennedy, scalia, thomas, and alito), a majority of the supreme court refused to

Article 6 - supreme court upholds bill nelson’s massive tax increase & medicare cuts on florida seniors
supreme court upholds bill nelson’s massive tax increase & medicare cuts on florida seniors (before it's news) decision sets the stakes for november’s election two years after u.s. senator bill nelson (d-fl) made clear that passing president obama’s massive health care bill would mean “unconscionable” cuts to medicare for florida seniors, the supreme court today has affirmed nelson’s decision to put president obama’s agenda ahead of florida seniors and small businesses. in doing so, the court has made clear what is at stake in november’s election. “the supreme court’s decision makes clear that bill nelson was not telling the truth when he promised that his massive health care bill would not increase taxes on florida families and small businesses. the stakes are now clear in this election – the only way to stop the massive tax increases, government spending, and cuts to medicare contained in obamacare is to replace liberal bill nelson in washington,” national republican senatorial committee (nrsc) spokesman jahan wilcox said today. background…. supreme court affirms bill nelson broke his 2009 promise not to raise taxes individual mandate ‘considered a tax,’ hits middle class families congressional budget office: at least 75% of individual mandate penalties fall on those making less than $$250,000.

Article 7 - health care act upheld!
health care act upheld! (before it's news) the entire aca is upheld, with the exception that the federal government’s power to terminate states’ medicaid funds is narrowly read. the deciding vote supporting it was that of c.j. roberts. the individual mandate survives by being deemed a tax. the only effect of not complying with the mandate is that you pay the tax. the court holds that the mandate violates the commerce clause, but that doesn’t matter because there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power. the court holds that the anti-injunction act doesn’t apply because the label “tax” is not controlling. justice ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. her opinion, for herself and sotomayor, breyer and kagan, joins the key section of roberts opinion on that point. she would go further and uphold the mandate under the commerce clause, which roberts wouldn’t. her opinion on commerce does not control. on the medicaid issue, a majority of the court holds that the medicaid expansion is constitutional but that it w/b unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions. the key comment on salvaging the medicaid expansion is this (from roberts): “nothing in our opinion precludes congress from offering funds under the aca to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states

Article 8 - what happens if obama gets to replace a conservative justice?
what happens if obama gets to replace a conservative justice? (before it's news) in the wall street journal, clink bolick writes about the supreme court stakes in 2012: . . . chief justice roberts has become a “swing” justice on the supreme court—along with justice kennedy, who has occupied the swing position held by justice sandra day o’connor until she was replaced by conservative justice samuel alito in 2006. the court now is composed of three solid conservatives and four solid liberals, with chief justice roberts and justice kennedy leaning conservative. even that mixture makes the current court the most conservative in nearly a century. but it also means that the replacement of a single conservative justice by president obama in a second term would turn the court sharply to the left. the obamacare ruling highlights the stakes. chief justice roberts joined the liberal justices in finding that the penalty imposed on individuals who refuse to sign up for government-prescribed health insurance is a permissible tax. but he sided with his fellow conservatives in holding that the mandate to buy insurance itself exceeded congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce. inactivity, the court held, is not commerce. by contrast, the liberal justices argued that anything that even indirectly affects commerce (which amounts to everything) can be regulated. with the replacement of one conservative justice by a liberal, congressional power under the constitution’s commerce clause will be boundless. by holding the line in june, then,

Article 1 - a look at republican priorities: comforting the comfortable
two weeks ago, the senate killed an effort to repeal the federal estate tax on multimillion-dollar fortunes. the ""no"" votes were a stand for budget sanity and basic fairness. but the pro-repeal camp doesn't want to take no for an answer. yesterday, the house of representatives passed an estate-tax cut that is a repeal in everything but name. the so-called compromise would exempt more than 99.5 percent of estates from tax, slash the tax rates on the rest and cost at least $760 billion during its first full decade. of that, $600 billion is the amount the government would have to borrow to make up for lost revenue from the cuts, which would benefit the heirs of america's wealthiest families, like the marses of mars bar and the waltons of wal-mart stores. the remaining $160 billion is the interest on that borrowing, which would be paid by all americans. no lawmaker who voted for the compromise gets any points for moderation. like the earlier full repeal bill, this one is unfair and grounded in intellectual dishonesty. the goal is not to pass good legislation, but to get this top priority for big-shot constituents nailed into law before the november elections produce a legislature that's more responsible on fiscal matters. in an attempt to rally support, house lawmakers have included in the bill another, totally unrelated, tax cut — for timber companies, worth $900 million over the next three years. the measure, based on the theory that american timber companies

Article 2 - justices allow the term 'tax' to embrace 'penalty'
there are lots of taxes that people pay only if they buy something -- sales taxes, taxes on cigarettes and taxes on airline tickets among them. but by calling the penalty for not buying health insurance a tax, the supreme court on thursday effectively created a tax that people will pay only if they do not buy something. that decision led some opponents of the health care law to proclaim that it was a large tax increase, something the sponsors of the bill had explicitly denied when the law was passed. to some extent, calling it a tax does break new ground. ''nobody here can think of an example where you pay a tax if you do not buy something,'' said howard gleckman, a resident fellow at the tax policy center in washington. ''but there are plenty of examples of where you get a tax break for doing something or buying something. in effect, your failure to buy something means you will pay more taxes.'' health insurance, as it happens, has long been one such area. suppose your employer pays you a $90,000 salary and spends $10,000 to buy health insurance for you. all $100,000 is considered a business expense and is therefore a tax deduction for the company, but you will pay income taxes only on the $90,000. if the employer did not buy insurance, but instead paid you the full $100,000, the company's tax bill would be unchanged. but you would pay taxes on the full $100,000, even

according to the latest new york times/cbs news poll, nearly 70 percent of americans say that congressional republicans’ policies favor the rich and that they oppose lowering taxes for large corporations. two-thirds polled say that wealth should be distributed more evenly; a similar share wants to increase taxes on millionaires, not cut them. in a previous times/cbs poll from august, a majority of americans also wanted to use tax increases to close the deficit, rather than rely only on spending cuts. mr. perry has not provided the details necessary to independently analyze the plan’s impact, but economists of the right and left agree that it would be a huge revenue loser. mr. perry’s main prescription for dealing with the deficit is to slash government spending down to a level last seen in the 1960s — before programs like medicare , pell grants and head start had kicked in and long before the baby boom generation was facing retirement . newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. of course, mr. perry isn’t the only republican contender calling for cutting taxes on the rich and gutting the government’s ability to pay

Article 4 - after a century of talking, tax plan has a familiar ring
in 1898, congress approved an excise tax on a luxury item of the day, the telephone, to help pay for the spanish-american war. and except for three tax-free hiatuses, it has been on the books since then. ''that war's been over a long time,'' representative jerry weller said today as the house moved toward repealing the tax, which is 3 percent on phone bills and costs the typical household $50 a year. mr. weller, a republican from illinois, is on the ways and means subcommittee on oversight that gave gentle questioning to witnesses who were urging repeal. the pro-tax side, if there is one, had no advocates. another member of the subcommittee, representative rob portman, republican of ohio, said: ''it finally drives a stake in the heart of the temporary tax that was imposed for the spanish-american war. it turns out the spanish were tougher than we thought.'' advertisement continue reading the main story the full ways and means committee is expected to approve a bill containing the repeal on wednesday. it is expected to pass easily in the house, and advocates have high hopes of passage in the senate.

Article 5 - states vie to shield the wealth of the 1 percent
yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway. “there is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,” said edward mccaffrey, a professor at the university of southern california gould school of law. “i think the real question now is: ‘where is the bottom?’” the federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. but in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the kloibers’ home of kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts. the clear leaders are nevada, delaware, south dakota and alaska, but other states have also joined the frenzy. new hampshire, wyoming, tennessee and ohio all hope to dip a spoon in the trillion-dollar-plus pot of cream that had traditionally been preserved in offshore tax havens like the cayman islands. over the last decade, for example, new hampshire has passed nearly a dozen laws affecting trusts that expanded their life span, lowered taxes and made it easier to transfer assets

Article 6 - obama to insist on tax increase for the wealthy
“while there may be disagreement in congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over $250,000 a year, nobody — not republicans, not democrats — want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,” he said. “so let’s not wait.” the president’s comments came shortly after speaker john a. boehner , who had been striking a conciliatory tone since republican election losses in the senate and the house, told reporters that republicans had won a mandate of their own by retaining control of the house and that he supported continuing rates enacted in the bush-era tax cuts for all income levels. “raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want,” said mr. boehner, who said he favored generating any new federal revenue to offset the deficit by closing tax loopholes and limiting deductions. “it’s clear that there are a lot of special interest loopholes in the tax code, both corporate and personal,” he said. “it’s also clear that there are all kinds of deductions, some of which make sense; others don’t. and by lowering rates and cleaning up the tax code, we know we’re going to get more economic growth.” photo the president and mr. boehner were careful with their language and left room for compromise despite their fundamental differences about shifting more of the tax burden to high-income americans. mr. boehner would not be very specific on

Article 7 - more cities pass soda taxes on sugary drinks
cbs/ap 52 am more cities pass soda taxes on sugary drinks a 32-ounce soda is filled at a mcdonald’s in new york city. mario tama, getty images stumble san francisco -- voters in four u.s. cities approved or appeared likely to approve special taxes on sugary drinks, energizing advocates who say the victories are indicative of growing momentum for measures that discourage people from guzzling calories. the penny-per-ounce taxes in three san francisco bay area cities will apply to energy, sweetened tea and sports drinks, but not to diet sodas or naturally sweetened drinks. on tuesday, measures in san francisco and oakland, california, captured about 60 percent of the vote, with approval higher in neighboring albany. in boulder, colorado, a 2-cent per ounce tax was headed toward victory, although ballots were still being counted on wednesday. “this is a very strong message to the soda industry, and this will lead to the introduction of new proposals all across the country,” said dr. john maa, secretary of the san francisco medical society. the philadelphia city council is expected to vote wednesday on a ""sugar tax"" on soft drinks. the mayor wants to add three cents an ounce to the p... the four cities join berkeley, california , which passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks in 2014, and philadelphia , which passed a

Article 8 - rand paul’s fake flat tax
every four years, republican candidates for the white house denounce the federal tax system — often advocating replacing it with a supposedly more equitable single tax rate — and this year is no exception. senator rand paul has already come up with a flat-tax reform plan, and it shows clearly, once again, that this is a fundamentally flawed idea. mr. paul has pledged to “blow up the tax code” by replacing all federal taxes with a flat 14.5 percent tax on personal and corporate income — except, that is, when his plan exempts income from taxation altogether by retaining popular write-offs. mr. paul proposes to continue deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, which would gut the supposed simplicity of a flat tax. the paul plan, like the flat-tax plans from previous campaigns, would fail to raise enough revenue to finance a modern government. estimates by the conservative tax foundation found that it would reduce revenue to the treasury by $1 trillion to $3 trillion over a decade. citizens for tax justice, a more liberal advocacy group, estimates a 10-year loss of $15 trillion. arguments about the proper role of government aside, a population and an economy that are growing in size and complexity cannot thrive with a shrinking government. photo the paul plan also fails the basic test of progressivity. it promises a big tax cut for everyone, but analyses show it would be a big tax cut for high earners and businesses and basically a wash for everyone else. and that’s being generous. if

Title: seeking the half-full glass
Content: seeking the half-full glass (before it's news) while i am feeling very glum about justice roberts’ decision to uphold the mandate as a tax, there are some bright sides to his decision. as john fund and ilya somin write, by saying that the mandate would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause, the court has put stronger limits on the commerce clause than we’ve seen previously. all those liberals who laughed at that construction of the mandate will now have to consider the new parameters of the clause. if congress wants to expand their powers, they’ll have to admit that they’re taxing people. of course, that means our hopes for limitations on their power will rest on their unwillingness to pass a new tax. todd gaziano of heritage writes that there are two important silver linings in the decisions, although he finds the main decision to read the mandate as a tax as inexplicable. despite the court’s error in reading the individual mandate penalty as a tax, five justices opined that the mandate, standing alone, cannot be justified under the commerce clause or the necessary and proper clause. this is not remarkable to anyone who knows the original meaning of the commerce and necessary and proper powers, but it is a serious blow to 90 percent of the legal academics and about 90 percent of congress, since these have been the clauses used to justify so much of the modern administrative state…. the majority’s ruling on the onerous conditions attached to the medicaid expansion is also helpful in limiting congress’s power to bribe states into submission or to threaten them with the loss of federal revenue in a long-run federal-state program. in a fractured set of opinions that will take some additional time to untangle, a majority of justices imposed limits on congress’s ability to threaten the denial of previous funding streams based on states’ agreeing to new funding conditions in those programs. indeed, seven justices seemed to agree that some constitutional limitations were breached in the medicaid expansion. this itself is a landmark ruling. liberal legal scholars are not going to like most of today’s constitutional rulings; their wailing will start pretty soon. in the long run, today’s constitutional rulings will be seen as an important victory in promoting fidelity to the constitution and the ideal of limited government. the american people and their elected representatives have a lot of work to do to repeal and replace the obamacare statute. moreover, we still have an uphill battle to restore and preserve the written constitution we have been bequeathed, but the court today put some temporary brakes on our republic’s descent down an extra-constitutional slippery slope in which the federal government can control any aspect of our lives that has any imaginable impact on commerce—meaning everything. if you were above all interested in the bill being struck down, it was mostly a loss. on the other hand, if you were more concerned about the qualitative expansion in the power of the government that the bill represented, it was definitely a win.jay cost agrees, now that ob

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US Supreme Court upheld nearly all of President Obama's health care overhaul, including the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance. The 5-4 decision was a victory for the president and ensured his signature domestic policy achievement remains mostly intact.

Chief Justice John Roberts joined the four left-leaning justices on the bench in crafting the majority decision. He ruled that the mandate could not be upheld under the commerce clause but could be upheld under the government's power to tax.

The court also upheld the Medicaid expansion, but found it unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions. The decision sets the stakes for November's election and has significant implications for healthcare reform.

The ruling rejected Obama's unprecedented argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress' power ""to regulate commerce among the several states."" The court held that the mandate violates the commerce clause, but found it constitutional as a tax.

The decision also affects Florida seniors, with the Supreme Court upholding a massive tax increase and Medicare cuts on them. The ruling makes clear what is at stake in November's election, with Republicans vowing to repeal the law if elected.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles discuss various tax-related topics in the US. 

A recent House of Representatives bill would exempt over 99.5% of estates from tax, slash tax rates on the rest, and cost $760 billion during its first decade. The bill's passage is seen as a compromise to pass a top priority for big-shot constituents before the November elections.

The Supreme Court effectively created a new tax by calling the penalty for not buying health insurance a ""tax."" This decision led some opponents of the healthcare law to claim it was a large tax increase, despite sponsors' denials.

A New York Times/CBS News poll found that nearly 70% of Americans believe congressional Republicans favor the rich and oppose lowering taxes for large corporations. Two-thirds want wealth distributed more evenly, while a similar share wants to increase taxes on millionaires.

The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve a bill repealing a 3% excise tax on phone bills, which costs households $50 per year.

Some states are competing to shield the wealth of the 1%. Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, and Alaska have passed laws to attract trust business, while other states like New Hampshire and Ohio also aim to do so.

President Obama stated that he will insist on a tax increase for those making over $250,000 per year. Speaker John A. Boehner supports continuing Bush-era tax cuts but favors closing loopholes and limiting deductions.

There are no significant contradictions or unsupported claims in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY that would indicate it is fake news. The only minor discrepancy is the mention of a ""parabolic rise"" in gold prices, which is not explicitly stated in the original article but is implied by Brent Cook's comparison to the 1970s.

According to Article 1, the US dollar's strengthening against the euro has led to lower precious metals prices, but analysts believe the euro project is not dead yet.

Article 2 features Charles Oliver, who continues to follow a long-term strategy in his fund, Sprott Gold & Precious Minerals Fund. He believes gold is in a bull market and is upgrading his portfolio with large-cap components.

Article 3 discusses gold stocks being out of favor, but Joe Foster from Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund disagrees, stating that miners are more attractive at this point due to valuations being at the bottom of the valuation range.

Article 4 suggests that the GLD Gold ETF may be cannibalizing the HUI gold-stock index by diverting capital away from traditional gold exposure. However, traders must be cautious not to extrapolate this theory too far.

Article 5 reports on the decline in profitability for gold mining companies due to plummeting prices, with some producers cutting spending on mines in half over three years.

Article 6 features Brent Cook, who expects to see a turnaround in the gold market and identifies nine companies that he believes will shine when commodity prices recover. He emphasizes the importance of patience and caution during bear markets.

Article 1 - what’s up with gold mining stocks?
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by ron hera december 22, 2011 ©2011 hera research, llc claims that the gold bull market has ended are incorrect. one of the main causes of recently lower precious metals prices is the fact that the u.s. dollar has strengthened against the euro. since the u.s. dollar is the world reserve currency, a stronger dollar lowers the u.s. dollar prices of global commodities. also, financial flights to safety, e.g., out of the euro or european sovereign bonds, temporarily increase demand for u.s. dollars and u.s. treasuries, strengthening the u.s. dollar against other currencies and lowering u.s. treasury yields. as the great american author and humorist mark twain famously said in 1887, “the report of my death was an exaggeration.” most analysts believe that the euro project has failed, which is to state the obvious. nonetheless, the euro isn’t dead until european banks, the european central bank (ecb) and european political leaders decide to end it. however, they will not let it end in the foreseeable future. european sovereign defaults, if they were allowed to occur, would not require the european monetary union (emu) to end, although the treaty of maastricht would have to be amended. what is far more important is that there is no way to allow sovereign defaults, or to break up the emu, while

Article 4 - gld cannibalizing the hui?
– posted friday, 8 february 2013 | share this article | source: goldseek.com with gold stocks languishing near lows in a desolate sentiment wasteland, investors are wondering why this sector has fallen so deeply out of favor. one theory is capital that would have traditionally flowed into major gold producers has been diverted into the gld gold etf instead. taken to extremes, this logically leads to the conclusion gold stocks will never thrive as long as gld exists. is it cannibalizing the miners? undoubtedly it is, so the real question is to what degree. since gld’s birth in november 2004, it has grown into a wildly successful behemoth holding a staggering $$71.5b worth of physical gold bullion in trust for its shareholders. i suspect the majority of gld purchases have been for diversifying large portfolios, for obtaining that necessary fractional exposure to the gold price. gld is fantastic for that. in a parallel universe where gld had never been conceived, some fraction of the massive capital it has attracted inarguably would have flowed into traditional “gold exposure” for portfolio diversification. and that was buying shares in the world’s biggest and best gold miners, the ones that dominate the leading gold-stock index (hui). thus the thesis that gld is cannibalizing the hui is correct to some extent. but traders have to be careful, as conspiracy theorists tend to extrapolate this theory way too far. despite gld

Article 1 - divining a 5-year investment strategy
regardless of whether a correction comes or not, this is where the medium-term projection should have value. instead of reading tea leaves, it should be able to assess tectonic shifts. so now that we’re in 2014, i wanted to consider what investment strategists think the near future could bring. trends some of their views are very broad — like stocks continuing to do well because of solid corporate earnings, low inflation and little pressure to raise wages given how high unemployment remains. but other views are based on stories that could play out for far longer than five years. production of oil and gas in the united states, for one, is expected to be stronger in five years. this is based on proven reserves and new drilling techniques. saying what will happen in six to 12 months in this industry, though, is always difficult: a pipeline could explode, turmoil in the middle east could impact prices, or regulation in washington could cost companies more money. longer term, the issue is supply and demand. “we’ve discovered through this shale drilling how to exploit much more natural gas than we ever thought we could,” said kent croft, chief investment officer of croft leominster. “have all the stocks been the greatest this year? no. do i expect them to outperform over time? i certainly do. i think this is one of those watershed moments in the u.s. economic outlook.” the mobile technology sector is another longer-term play. mr. sass said payment

Article 3 - oil prices raise cost of making range of goods
“our strategy is to raise prices and improve the mix to offset the cost of raw materials,” said keith price, a goodyear spokesman. “no one has predicted how long we can continue to do that.” the sense that many companies may be hitting a wall is palpable. corporate profits peaked last spring and have shrunk since then, moody’s economy.com reports, drawing on commerce department data. the housing crisis and the weakening economy are big reasons, but oil prices are adding greatly to the pressure on profits as retailers fail to pass along higher prices to consumers. that helps to explain why expensive oil has not yet pushed up the inflation rate. so far this year, the nation’s employers have been cutting jobs at an accelerating pace, particularly last month, when the unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent from 5 percent. but with the vise on corporate profits tightening and the price of oil continuing to climb, more dire action, including job cuts and higher prices, may be in store, economists say, although there is still room to avoid such steps. “companies came into this period with extraordinarily high profit margins,” said edward mckelvey, chief domestic economist at goldman sachs, “and some of the surge in raw material costs will be absorbed by lowering those profits.” still, the prevailing attitude that the economy could just keep absorbing higher oil prices is being tested — for the first time in nearly 30 years. adjusted for inflation, a barrel of

while 2005 was a banner year for iron ore, with bhp and other leading producers winning a price increase of more than 70 percent from steel mills in china and japan, 2006 is turning out to be the year for copper. prices have doubled since january — less than a year after bhp paid $7 billion to buy another producer, wmc resources, and bolster its copper output by 20 percent. the higher prices for copper contributed $2.6 billion to the company’s pretax profit. bhp said worldwide demand for commodities remained strong despite broadly rising interest rates. growth was particularly robust, mr. goodyear said, in europe and japan. and while china and india are increasing their rates to brake extraordinary growth, he said demand was unlikely to suffer as the industrialization in these countries continued to fuel demand for raw materials. “we think it’s going to be very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle,” the executive said. bhp’s sales to china rose 10 percent, to $6.6 billion, and now represent 16.8 percent of total revenue. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later.

Article 5 - trump plan to boost oil, coal could send prices lower

Article 7 - french refinery strike stirs fears of fuel shortage
a strike at total refineries in france entered a second week on monday with no signs of abating, raising fears about possible fuel shortages in the country. eighty percent of total's refinery workers were on strike on sunday, according to the union, which has called for the strike to spread beyond total to sites operated by exxon mobil, petroplus, lyondellbasell and ineos. the union said that output would be fully halted at total's largest refinery, gonfreville, by late tuesday. the strike, called over the oil giant's plans to end refining at its dunkirk site, is symptomatic of broader problems in a sector where capacity is running ahead of demand. rapid expansion during the commodity boom has given way to weaker consumption amid the downturn. workers at total's six french oil-refining plants and some storage depots have been on strike since feb. 16 to protest total's plans for dunkirk, where operations have been suspended since september. the workers have been promised that they will not lose their jobs; they are seeking assurances on the future of refining at the site, which employs 370 directly as well as several hundred indirectly. the total spokesman said that 119 of 2,000 gas stations in the main total-elf network had shortages on monday. the company also services supermarkets and many industrial clients. talks between total, which has pledged to retain industrial activities at the site, and workers broke down on sunday. total said on monday that

Article 8 - after lean years, big oil may emerge stronger than ever
besides being forced to cut its dividend, conocophillips reduced its capital budget for exploration and production by more than $10 billion — or roughly two-thirds. since late 2014, its shares have fallen from over $70 to around $40 recently. but if crude prices can stay above $40 a barrel, the dividends, and stock prices, of the big american oil companies should be secure. and if oil stays above $50, or even hits $60 in the coming months or years, big oil may well emerge from the recent lean years stronger than ever. “whoever survives this is going to win,” said michael rothman, a veteran oil analyst who is president of cornerstone analytics, a new jersey-based research firm. “they’re going to come out smelling like roses.” what is more, the big pullback in exploration has caused a steady drop in the cost of completing those projects that are still underway, as prices for steel, drilling rigs and other services have plunged. that should enable major energy firms to take advantage of economies of scale and increase their profit margins further. “capital spending has come down massively, and majors have taken a lot of the fat out of their organizations,” said neil mehta, who tracks the north american integrated oil and refining industry for goldman sachs. now, after investing tens of billions of dollars, many of these giant projects are set to come online in the next few years, and mr. mehta said he expected big

Title: rick rule & brent cook: gold correction to bring pawnbroker paradise
Content: rick rule & brent cook: gold correction to bring pawnbroker paradise headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the gold report: the performance gap between equities and their underlying commodities has been especially noteworthy with gold. brent, you wrote recently that the gold price has outperformed mid-tier gold mining stocks since 2005, with the price of gold up 190% versus 70%�90% for gold equities. is this because investors can buy gold more easily now, or are some systemic reasons behind the equities’ underperformance? brent cook: several dynamics are involved. certainly one is that you can now buy gold through exchange traded funds (etfs). that is a very simple bet on the gold price that does not carry all the baggage that comes with mining the stuff. that baggage includes the almost universal underestimation of development and mining costs published by mining companies, engineering firms and equity analysts. capital costs are rising sharply due to the basic increase in cement, steel, fuel and everything else that goes into building a mine. production costs are going up for many of the same reasons, plus rising labor costs. qualified and experienced people are hard to come by and overworked. the result is lower-quality engineering studies and misses on cost estimates. additionally, with the higher gold price, companies are mining lower-grade ore, which cuts down on margin per ounce produced. then, we have the almost continual issuance of stock whenever a brokerage firm sees a chance to make a commission. from my dealings with value-oriented funds, this continual dilution from mining companies has been very frustrating and perplexing. given everything i mentioned, it’s not hard to see why the leverage we expected in gold equities at a $1,500 price hasn’t materialized. tgr: so, will we ever see the leverage? bc: now is probably a good time to look at mid- to large-tier companies that have good production profiles at the lower end of the production cash costs and high cash flow per share. tgr: what’s your opinion on that, rick? rick rule: with regard to the juniors, everybody looks to the 1970s as the analogue, when we had that huge parabolic rise. that won’t happen again. we won’t see the circumstances we had in the mid- and late-1970s, when there was a shortage of stock. the industry now has the infrastructure to print paper�stock certificates�faster than demand can ever develop. brent nailed the reasons for the underperformance. people don’t have to invest in gold stocks; they can invest in a gold proxy in the stock market. the underperformance has been disgusting, frankly, and investors are punishing the industry deservedly. the basic product going from $250�$1,500 an ounce without margins going parabolic is truly sick. tgr: given that, why should anyone invest in a junior at this

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss the current state of gold mining stocks and the potential for a turnaround. According to Article 1, the US dollar's strengthening against the euro has led to lower precious metals prices, but analysts believe the euro project is not dead yet.

Article 2 features Charles Oliver, who continues to follow a long-term strategy in his fund, Sprott Gold & Precious Minerals Fund. He believes gold is in a bull market and is upgrading his portfolio with large-cap components.

Article 3 discusses gold stocks being out of favor, but Joe Foster from Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund disagrees, stating that miners are more attractive at this point due to valuations being at the bottom of the valuation range.

Article 4 suggests that the GLD Gold ETF may be cannibalizing the HUI gold-stock index by diverting capital away from traditional gold exposure. However, traders must be cautious not to extrapolate this theory too far.

Article 5 reports on the decline in profitability for gold mining companies due to plummeting prices, with some producers cutting spending on mines in half over three years.

Article 6 features Brent Cook, who expects to see a turnaround in the gold market and identifies nine companies that he believes will shine when commodity prices recover. He emphasizes the importance of patience and caution during bear markets.

Article 7 provides a long-term outlook for gold, focusing on medium- and long-term charts and analyzing the metal priced in currencies other than the US dollar.

Article 1 - a black hole that has stopped swallowing stars
the brightest orb in the center of this photograph captured by the hubble space telescope is a galaxy some 300 million light-years away called ngc 4889. at its core rests a supermassive black hole that is about 21 billion times the size of the sun, according to nasa and the european space agency. though you cannot see it in this image because black holes swallow light, nasa said it was one of the largest star devourers ever observed. it dwarfs the black hole that twists at the center of our milky way, which researchers estimate is only four million times the size of the sun. the monster once feasted upon many of its host galaxy’s stars, gas and dust, but is no longer active. the diameter of its event horizon, or the edge of where light is trapped and cannot escape, measured 80 billion miles, and its intense gravitational grasp was capable of heating material to millions of degrees, according to nasa.

Article 2 - astronomers watch a supernova and see reruns
dr. kelly is lead author of a report describing the supernova published on thursday in the journal science. robert kirshner, a supernova expert at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics who was not involved in the work, said: “we’ve seen gravitational lenses before, and we’ve seen supernovae before. we’ve even seen lensed supernovae before. but this multiple image is what we have all been hoping to see.” supernovas are among the most violent and rare events in the universe, occurring perhaps once per century in a typical galaxy. they outshine entire galaxies, spewing elemental particles like oxygen and gold out into space to form the foundations of new worlds, and leaving behind crushed remnants called neutron stars or black holes. because of the galaxy cluster standing between this star and the hubble, “basically, we got to see the supernova four times,” dr. kelly said. and the explosion is expected to appear again in another part of the sky in the next 10 years. timing the delays between its appearances, he explained, will allow astronomers to refine measurements of how fast the universe is expanding and to map the mysterious dark matter that supplies the bulk of the mass and gravitational oomph of the universe. the heavens continue to light candles for albert einstein. on march 14 he would have been 136, and this year marks a century since his greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity that

Article 4 - light show that fizzled
like eager paparazzi, astronomers trained an arsenal of telescopes this spring on the milky way’s crowded center, hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch an immense gas cloud collide with the galaxy’s supermassive black hole. the shock generated when the cloud smashed into gas surrounding the black hole, 26,000 light-years from earth, could have produced radio waves, x-rays and a possible brightening of infrared light. but researchers saw nothing. new observations of the cloud, known as g2 — along with a neighboring gas cloud, g1, that passed close to the black hole 13 years ago — have led astronomers to an intriguing explanation for the light show that wasn’t. stefan gillessen of the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching, germany, and his colleagues found that g1 and g2 have identical orbits that lie in the same plane as that of young stars near the milky way’s center. the team suggests that both clouds, along with a gas tail that appears to be trailing g2, are all part of a stream of gas that gravity ripped from the envelope of a young star about 100 years earlier. like rocks carried by a swift current, the clouds may be dense lumps embedded in the moving gas stream. there may be additional lumps in the tail that could serve as future snacks for the black hole, known as sagittarius a*. that interpretation is open for debate. but

Article 5 - squeezing the milky way into a photo
photo q. when i see a published photograph purporting to be of the entire milky way, i wonder, was it really possible for someone to take it? a. many of the photos illustrating the milky way are actually top or bottom views of other presumably similar galaxies. an earthbound observer cannot stand outside earth’s home galaxy and photograph its overall pinwheel structure, with its spiraling arms and central cluster of stars. earth is in a corner of what humans see as a diffuse nighttime haze of stars. one model often chosen as a stand-in is the galaxy messier 74, because many scientists assume its spiral looks the way the milky way would look if photographed from above or below its plane. another stand-in has been the neighboring andromeda galaxy, or messier 31. a satellite image of the milky way from within the galaxy shows some indications of its structure. a groundbreaking panoramic view was made in 1990 by the cosmic background explorer satellite, capturing near-infrared wavelengths of light in a time exposure. it shows the central bulge of stars as a bright spot placed at the middle of a thin line that represents the sparser collection reaching out in either direction. if this image were wrapped around the viewer, it would be very close to how an edge-on view of a spiral galaxy would appear.

massive galaxy cluster found 'hiding' behind the milky way the vela supercluster could help explain how our own galaxy group moves. save thomas jarrett, university of cape town you would think that it would be easy to spot a cosmic structure as enormous as a supercluster holding legions of galaxies, but not so -- the milky way can hide all kinds of objects , usually due to dust and stars obscuring the view. if you need proof, you just need to ask the astronomers who have discovered the vela supercluster, a giant collection of galaxies about 800 million light years away (shown as ""vsc"" above). they only detected it by making ""thousands"" of spectroscopic studies of partially obscured galaxies -- it was hidden on the far side of the milky way. the actual details of the supercluster, such as its full size, mass and gravitational pull, are still forthcoming. researchers will need to use radio astronomy (such as the new meerkat facility) and other techniques to measure an area that remains a relative mystery. once that happens, however, humanity could learn a lot about the movement of both the milky way and other galaxies in the local group. superclusters have enough gravitational influence to pull galaxies along in neighboring clusters, and vela's existence could help explain the movement of our celestial home.

Article 7 - c. megan urry, peering into universe, spots bias on ground
c. megan urry credit christopher capozziello for the new york times c. megan urry is a former president of the american astronomical society and the first woman to head the physics department at yale university. recently inducted to the national academy of sciences , she has published pioneering studies on the role of black holes in the formation of galaxies . more than 20 years ago, dr. urry helped organize 200 scientists who issued the baltimore charter for women in astronomy , which declared that “women should not have to be clones of male astronomers in order to participate in mainstream astronomical research.” more recently, she announced that scientists with a record of sexual harassment would no longer be welcome at the astronomical society’s meetings. we spoke at her new haven, conn., office. a condensed and edited version of the conversation follows. q. why was the meeting ban necessary? a. we had a situation where we had young female astronomers reporting conference experiences that were very different from those of their male counterparts. the men came and used the event to network. the women came and sometimes found themselves worried about people propositioning them. i wanted to make clear what our values are. i said straight out, “look, our meetings are not ‘the dating game.’ this is a professional environment. act professionally.” was there much sexual harassment at astronomy conferences? probably no more than at other corners of academe. it’s a problem all over. i suspect we’re hearing more about astronomy

Article 8 - stars burst on scene ensemble, astronomer suggests
dr. margon said the result would be controversial ''because it is a very difficult measurement,'' and dr. lanzetta himself said his conclusions would require further analysis and observations. ''if this can be verified, it will dramatically change our understanding of the universe,'' said dr. anne kinney, director of astronomy and physics at nasa. ''because stars are the building blocks of galaxies and the birthplace of solar systems, proving that countless numbers of stars began forming so early after the birth of the universe could cause us to rethink a lot of our theories.'' dr. lisa storrie-lombardi, an astronomer at the california institute of technology in pasadena, said the research indeed appeared to reach back to the first epoch of star formation. ''i am very confident,'' she said. ''the distance measurements are very good indications of their true distances.'' but because the observed objects are so far away and faint, beyond the range of the most trusted means of measuring cosmic distances, some scientists were reserving judgment. calling the results ''very important, if true,'' dr. mario livio, a theorist at the space telescope science institute, said in an interview: ''there's nothing wrong with what they are doing; it's the best one can do at those distances. but it seems to take a necessary leap of faith.'' what dr. lanzetta and his colleagues at stony brook did was analyze with different filters the color of infrared light from the faint galaxies in the

Title: anne’s picture of the day: ngc 2787
Content: anne’s picture of the day: ngc 2787 (before it's news) read more at anne’s astronomy news http://annesastronomynews.com/ october 28, 2012 ngc 2787, a lenticular galaxy in ursa major image credit: m. carollo (swiss federal institute of technology, zurich), nasa and the hubble heritage team (stsci/aura) ngc 2787 is a barred lenticular galaxy of about 4500 light-years across, located approximately 24 million light-years away in the constellation ursa major. it is moving away from us at about 696 kilometers per second. lenticular galaxies are lens-shaped galaxies and, like spiral galaxies, they contain a disk, but like elliptical galaxies, they are usually short on dust and gas. they show little or no evidence of the grand spiral arms that occur in their more photogenic cousins. lenticulars are relatively little studied, possibly because of their seemingly benign nature. however, despite ngc 2787′s seemingly bland qualities astronomers did take a look at the center of this galaxy in order to understand what happens in the center and to help determine how lenticular galaxies formed, including the role of galaxy collisions and central black holes. pictures and evidence indicate that lenticulars can be both photogenic and scientifically interesting after all. for example, the above image of ngc 2787. although the galaxy has no appreciable spiral structure or ongoing star formation, this image shows that the center of this lenticular galaxy does have an interesting structure. it contains a faint bar (not apparent in this image) and a bright nucleus, encircled with tightly wound, almost concentric, arms of dark dust. measurements of the speed of gas quite near the center of the galaxy show that it is accelerated to high speed, probably by a supermassive black hole that is quietly consuming small amounts of matter. astronomers study this black hole to learn more about the relationship between supermassive black holes and their parent galaxies. ngc 2787 may be in the latest stages of an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg). there are about a dozen globular clusters hovering around ngc 2787 visible in this image. what appear to be stars are, in fact, gravitationally bound families of hundreds of thousands of ancient stars orbiting the center of the galaxy. this image was made with the hubble space telescope using hubble’s wide field planetary camera 2 in january 1999, by combining light from blue, green and infrared filters. n/a source:

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Recent astronomical discoveries have shed new light on the universe. A massive black hole, 21 billion times the size of the Sun, has stopped swallowing stars and is now dormant (Article 1). In contrast, a supernova observed by astronomers appears as multiple images due to gravitational lensing, providing insights into the expansion of the universe (Article 2).

Astronomers have also discovered new stars in a nebula using infrared light, which will not ignite for tens of thousands of years (Article 3). However, a recent attempt to observe a massive gas cloud colliding with the Milky Way's supermassive black hole was unsuccessful due to dust and stars obscuring the view (Article 4).

The Milky Way can hide cosmic structures like galaxy clusters, which were recently discovered using spectroscopic studies of partially obscured galaxies (Article 6). Another discovery involves bias on the ground in astronomical research, with efforts to create a more inclusive environment for women in astronomy (Article 7).

Recent measurements suggest that stars may have burst into existence early after the universe's birth, challenging current theories about galaxy formation and solar system creation (Article 8). These findings highlight the importance of continued exploration and analysis of the universe.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Astronomers have made several discoveries in recent years. In Article 1, a team of astronomers discovered a ""monster"" black hole in NGC 1277, a lenticular galaxy located about 220 million light-years away.

Article 2 discusses the Orion Nebula, a star-forming region with glowing gas clouds and hot young stars. Astronomers have identified what appear to be numerous infant planetary systems within the nebula.

In Article 3, Anne's Image of the Day features Messier 65 (M65), an intermediate spiral galaxy in Leo, approximately 35 million light-years away. The galaxy has a prominent central bulge and tightly wound spiral arms.

Article 4 showcases NGC 1097, a barred spiral galaxy in Fornax, about 45 million light-years away. The galaxy features long, spindly arms of stars and a strong bar, with a supermassive black hole at its center.

Article 5 highlights the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), an actively producing new stars located near the southern constellation Dorado. Telescopes can reveal intricate details about smaller star-forming regions within the cloud.

In Article 6, astronomers have captured images of rare polar-ring galaxies, including NGC 660. These galaxies are formed when two galaxies interact and collide.

Article 7 discusses a strange, glowing green cloud of gas discovered by Hubble in 2007. The cloud is lit up by a nearby quasar

The article also mentions specific companies like Ford, Peugeot, and Opel, which are mentioned in the summary. There are no significant contradictions between the article and the facts presented in the summary. The article provides detailed information about the industry's struggles, including financial losses and job cuts, which supports the claims made in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","The articles discuss various topics related to the decline of manufacturing, environmental policies, and economic trends. 

Article 1 highlights how free trade has made democracy a disadvantage by eliminating jobs and transferring manufacturing capacity to foreign shores. The author argues that this has led to a constant elimination of jobs and a formula for disaster.

Article 2 criticizes the ""green movement"" for driving industrial manufacturing out of business, resulting in a constant elimination of jobs and transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign shores. The article claims that this has been a reckless orgy of economic extravagance driven by environmental values.

Article 3 discusses the decline of the US auto industry, stating that once the US was the leader in car production, but now Japan and Germany produce more vehicles than the US. The article argues that the US needs to start making things again to remain a great nation.

Article 4 reveals that millions of brand new unsold cars are just sitting redundant on runways and car parks around the world, with some examples shown in images. This is attributed to stagnant end demand for new cars.

Article 5 reports that Volkswagen's settlement with US diesel owners and government regulators over polluting vehicles is valued at over $15 billion, including $10.033 billion for buybacks and nearly $5 billion for excess emissions.

Article 6 discusses the ""Club of Liberals,"" a group of people who accept big government as a given, regardless of their political affiliation. The article argues that this group supersedes the US Constitution's limitations on central authority.

Article 7 addresses concerns about silver supply, stating that the industry is experiencing a lack of refined silver and high premiums, which may define the market less by price and more by supply.

Article 8 reports on the continued pickup in auto sales, with a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million total vehicles sold in July, up from June's figure. This represents a shift upward in momentum from last year.","The European automotive industry is facing significant challenges. G.M.'s Opel unit is struggling, and the company may file for bankruptcy by June 1. The German government has offered financial aid to potential buyers, including Fiat and Magna International.

Ford is downsizing its European operations, closing three plants in Belgium and Britain, which will reduce production capacity by 18% and eliminate 5,700 jobs. The company's European division produced 2.25 million vehicles last year but sold only 1.7 million.

The industry is also dealing with overcapacity, with some plants operating at only 74% of their potential. A merger between Opel and Peugeot could help address this issue, potentially lifting Peugeot's market share to 16%.

Ford has reported a surprise loss, and the company plans to add new initiatives to its turnaround plan in the next 60 days. The company is looking to stabilize and increase its North American market share, which has been declining since the beginning of the decade.

European auto sales have fallen to 14 million vehicles this year, down from 18 million in 2008.

Article 1 - auto troubles touch many corners: europe feels the strain of protecting workers and plants
sales have dropped sharply in both markets, however, and experts say europe has at least 25 percent too much production capacity. in recent years, car production at new plants in central and eastern europe has surged, but few of the older, more expensive factories in france, belgium or germany have closed. “if they don’t take the pain now the way the u.s. is accepting it, you’re just storing up a crisis in 10 years time,” stuart pearson, an analyst with credit suisse in london, said. for now, however, european workers and politicians prefer to put off any hard decisions. as g.m. lurches toward a likely bankruptcy filing by june 1 and several bidders race to make a deal for opel and the rest of g.m. europe, the goal of preserving jobs, not profits, could determine the winner. along with g.m.’s endorsement, financial aid from the german government will be needed by any of the potential acquirers, which include the italian automaker fiat as well as magna international, a canadian auto parts maker with major operations in europe, and rhj international, a brussels-based private equity firm. “too many players and too much capacity is a recipe for value destruction,” mr. pearson said. the stakes are especially high for fiat, whose chief executive, sergio marchionne, has embraced the american approach and called for consolidation with a few global players dominating the industry. last month

Article 2 - ford closing 3 plants in european downsizing
ford’s chief executive, alan r. mulally, said the automaker was working with its unions in belgium and britain to assist workers affected by the factory closings. “we recognize the impact our actions will have on many employees and their families in europe, and we will work together with all stakeholders during this necessary transformation of our business,” he said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. ford had said wednesday that it would close its assembly plant in genk, belgium, by the end of 2014. on thursday, it said it would also close two plants in southampton and dagenham in britain next year. the actions will reduce production capacity in europe by 18 percent, or 355,000 vehicles. the company said it would eliminate 4,300 positions in belgium and 1,400 in britain. the moves contrast with those of other automakers that have either avoided plant closings altogether, or scheduled shutdowns for several years from now. one industry analyst said other auto companies in europe could follow ford’s lead and step up their restructuring efforts. “there is something to be said for swallowing all of the bad medicine at one time,” said michael robinet, managing director of ihs automotive consulting in northville, mich. “i think other manufacturers have to acknowledge a real sense of urgency now.” european auto sales have fallen to a projected 14 million vehicles this year, down from about 18 million in 2008

Article 4 - berlin rejects aid for g.m.’s opel unit
mr. reilly said that he was “very disappointed” with berlin’s decision to deny aid and that he did not understand the reasoning. the decision comes after a negative assessment last week by a german government advisory committee. mr. reilly said that the economics minister, rainer brüderle, told him that the government did not want to distort the market. but other automakers in europe have received billions in government-backed loans, mr. reilly said. the decision is a serious setback to g.m.’s efforts to resuscitate opel, which has continued to lose market share in europe to rivals like renault and psa peugeot citroën. opel and vauxhall brand cars accounted for 7 percent of west european car sales through april, down from 7.6 percent in the period a year earlier, according to the european automobile manufacturers’ association. peter wells, a director of the center for automotive industry research at cardiff university, said that sales could continue to suffer because customers would worry about whether opel would survive to support its products. opel may also have trouble retaining its best employees, mr. well said, and suppliers may be reluctant to devote research and development money to products for opel. photo “it’s very difficult for a company to turn that around,” he said. mr. reilly said that opel was hurt by poor sales in the crucial german market, where total new registrations plunged 25.5 percent in the

carlos tavares has shown he can quickly turn around troubled european carmakers. within three years of his taking charge at the paris-based psa group, the company’s profit margin has tripled. now mr. tavares may be preparing to take on a new challenge by acquiring general motors’ troubled european unit. combining europe’s third- and sixth-largest makers of passenger cars would be a big step toward ending the gridlock in the continent’s auto industry. despite years of downsizing and a rebound in demand for new vehicles, the industry suffers from overcapacity. peugeot plants operate at around 74 percent of their potential, according to evercore isi analysts. uniting the opel and vauxhall brands with peugeot and citroen would lift psa’s european market share to 16 percent, second only to volkswagen’s 24 percent. bigger companies have better bargaining power with suppliers and are better able to pay rising research and development costs. renault of france and nissan of japan provide a possible road map. the companies, which are both run by carlos ghosn as chief executive and have significant cross-shareholdings, reckon their alliance lowered costs by 4.3 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2015 — equivalent to about 3.5 percent of combined sales. advertisement continue reading the main story if psa and general motors europe achieved similar savings, costs would fall by 1.9 billion euros, based on

Article 8 - ford reports a surprising loss
ford’s stock fell 4.7 percent that day, and has been mainly drifting downward since then. it was trading near $6.25 a share at midday, down 8 cents from wednesday’s close. on a conference call with analysts and reporters today, ford officials said the company planned to add new intiatives to its turnaround plan, called the way forward, in the next 60 days. “we’re starting to put plans together to accelerate our actions, and take them further, faster and deeper,” said mark fields, president of ford’s division for the americas, who is in charge of the program. mr. fields said the company was looking at “every element” of the plan, which originally called for ford to close 14 plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs through 2012. ford also pledged to stabilize and then increase its north american market share, which has been declining since the beginning of the decade, and to return to profitability there in 2008. bill ford, the automaker’s chief executive, said today that that was still the company’s goal. but he said the company did not anticipate that american buyers’ appetites would shift away from the big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that make up a majority of ford’s sales, nor did officials expect prices for oil and other materials to rise as much as they have. “the speed and magnitude of the market shift is putting added pressure on our costs,” mr. ford said.

ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY
-------------------
Title: europe’s auto industry has reached day of reckoning
Content: huge overcapacity, some auto executives say, has spawned a crisis similar to the one the u.s. industry barely survived just a few years ago. in fact, the downturn in europe threatens the remarkably rapid recoveries that ford and general motors were able to make after detroit’s moment of truth in 2009. underused plants are ruinous for car companies, which must continue to pay upkeep costs and make payroll even as revenue plunges. by some estimates, the european industry as a whole is operating at only about 60 percent to 65 percent of capacity. as a general rule, plants must operate at about 75 percent or 80 percent to be profitable, analysts say. the figures may be much worse for some factories, including fiat plants in italy, analysts said. at the same time, german luxury carmakers like bmw and mercedes continue to thrive and are operating at or near capacity. few business undertakings are more tortuous than closing a european car factory. peugeot braved howls from unions and the new socialist government of françois hollande this month when it said that it would close a plant in aulnay, outside paris, in hopes of stemming losses that reached €819 million, or $993 million, in the first half of this year. closing a plant typically requires a long and costly battle with unions, which have more legal rights than in the united states. german law, for example, requires companies to negotiate job cuts with worker representatives, who can demand large severance payments or pensions. in an effort avoid a confrontation with labor, peugeot has promised to convert its plant in aulnay, which employs 3,000 people, to other, unspecified manufacturing. the company also promised to help employees find new jobs after car production ends in 2014. but such measures add to the cost at a time when peugeot is hemorrhaging money. and the compromises have not prevented political leaders from pushing the company to scale back plans to cut a total of 8,000 jobs in france, or dissuaded workers from protesting outside the company’s paris headquarters on wednesday. photo even after four years of catastrophic sales, only a few of europe’s 100 or so auto plants have shut down. the closures include an opel factory in antwerp and a fiat plant in sicily. advertisement continue reading the main story “it’s a question of who has the stomach for the fight,” said tim urquhart, an analyst at ihs automotive. but with the european car industry on track to suffer its worst year since 1996, more closings seem unavoidable. about 12.4 million vehicles will be sold in the european union this year, according to industry estimates. that is 3 million less than in 2007. the car industry provides one of the most vivid examples of how the euro zone debt crisis is infecting companies outside the financial industry. there are some disturbing parallels.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various topics related to the decline of manufacturing, environmental policies, and economic trends. 

Article 1 highlights how free trade has made democracy a disadvantage by eliminating jobs and transferring manufacturing capacity to foreign shores. The author argues that this has led to a constant elimination of jobs and a formula for disaster.

Article 2 criticizes the ""green movement"" for driving industrial manufacturing out of business, resulting in a constant elimination of jobs and transfer of manufacturing capacity to foreign shores. The article claims that this has been a reckless orgy of economic extravagance driven by environmental values.

Article 3 discusses the decline of the US auto industry, stating that once the US was the leader in car production, but now Japan and Germany produce more vehicles than the US. The article argues that the US needs to start making things again to remain a great nation.

Article 4 reveals that millions of brand new unsold cars are just sitting redundant on runways and car parks around the world, with some examples shown in images. This is attributed to stagnant end demand for new cars.

Article 5 reports that Volkswagen's settlement with US diesel owners and government regulators over polluting vehicles is valued at over $15 billion, including $10.033 billion for buybacks and nearly $5 billion for excess emissions.

Article 6 discusses the ""Club of Liberals,"" a group of people who accept big government as a given, regardless of their political affiliation. The article argues that this group supersedes the US Constitution's limitations

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The European automotive industry is facing significant challenges. G.M.'s Opel unit is struggling, and the company may file for bankruptcy by June 1. The German government has offered financial aid to potential buyers, including Fiat and Magna International.

Ford is downsizing its European operations, closing three plants in Belgium and Britain, which will reduce production capacity by 18% and eliminate 5,700 jobs. The company's European division produced 2.25 million vehicles last year but sold only 1.7 million.

The industry is also dealing with overcapacity, with some plants operating at only 74% of their potential. A merger between Opel and Peugeot could help address this issue, potentially lifting Peugeot's market share to 16%.

Ford has reported a surprise loss, and the company plans to add new initiatives to its turnaround plan in the next 60 days. The company is looking to stabilize and increase its North American market share, which has been declining since the beginning of the decade.

European auto sales have fallen to 14 million vehicles this year, down from 18 million in 2008. The industry is also facing pressure from climate change, with some cities and companies committing to the Paris accord despite the US withdrawal.

A Texas family's car and garage were vandalized with racist graffiti, but the husband later admitted to staging it himself. A black man arrested for writing racist messages at a college was found to be a white supremacist. A young woman from Ann Arbor fabricated a story about Trump supporters attacking her.

In another incident, a protester who threw Russian flags at Trump was found to have been on a watch list and had previously attempted to get close to the President.

A gunman opened fire on congressmen and aides in Virginia, wounding several people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. The suspect is in custody and has been charged with multiple counts of assault.

Article 2 - trump to criminalize filming police shootings if elected: “it’s just an excuse for racist labels”
charlotte, n.c. – the charlotte-mecklenburg police department on saturday released portions of video footage of the police shooting of keith scott. scott was killed by police tuesday in an incident described very differently by police and witnesses. a graphic video released on saturday, taken from police body camera footage of the incident, shows an officer trying to gain access to scott’s vehicle. it captures the moments after scott goes down, but the shooting itself is obscured. reacting to the controversial video of the incident, republican presidential candidate donald trump said in an interview with fox news that the rise in police shootings that has occurred in recent months serves “as an excuse for handing out racist labels,” when in reality, many of the shootings were “pretty justified.” “now, don’t get me wrong – i think the police are making a lot of mistakes, as well,” trump said. “but the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that these videos can be very easily misused to paint the picture of police officers who are killing suspects intentionally, just for the heck of it.” “and that is precisely why i intend to criminalize those body cams that serve against police officers who are wearing them the second i am elected, we can’t have any more of that,” he added. “and here’s a very simple reason why that’s such a good idea. police officers protect citizens and the law because they have a duty and an obligation to do

Article 3 - shocking revelation on protester who threw russian flags at trump is bad news for capitol police
a new revelation in the case of ryan clayton — the protester who managed to make his way into the press area of the capitol to get close to president donald trump — is bad news for the capitol police. fox news reported that clayton was known by capitol police, and they had him on a watch list. it turns out clayton was denied entry earlier on tuesday but managed to go through a tunnel later without having to show his id. the id he did have was an outdated, four-day visitor’s pass. he then got to the senate chamber, where members of the press were waiting and blended in with them. as trump passed by them, clayton threw russian flags and shouted “treason” at him. “this was a monumental f**k up,” a senior congressional security source told fox news. clayton caused a scene on capitol hill in july, when trump’s son-in-law, jared kushner, met with the senate intelligence committee. in that incident, clayton tried to get kushner to sign a russian flag as he left. fox news congressional reporter chad pergram said there will probably be serious consequences for the officers who were present. “some heads will roll,” a source told him. in a press release, capitol police said clayton was only charged with unlawful conduct, a misdemeanor. if he is convicted on the charge, he could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and face a

Article 1 - in italy, rioting leads to recriminations
the center-right government sought to blame left-wing groups and their sympathizers. defense minister ignazio la russa attributed the violence to a tone used by the italian left in which “everything is justifiable as long as we can get rid of berlusconi.” those arrested, however, did little to lend credence to that accusation. news reports said that some of the 12 arrested were believed to belong to right-wing soccer fan groups, while others were linked to self-styled anarchist groups. to some italians, the images of rome in flames cast light on the government’s shortcomings, suggesting that a government elected promising law and order and led by a salesman once perfectly attuned to the national mood had lost control not only of the demonstration, but also of the economy, and increasingly of public opinion. the violence came at a time of deep political uncertainty. “italians are indulgent toward the government because they don’t see that there’s an alternative,” said massimo franco, a political commentator for the daily newspaper corriere della sera. “but when they realize that the government cannot do anything — and even makes fun of them, especially about the economy — at that point the lack of alternatives isn’t enough.” he added: “when italians turn the page, they turn it definitely. the big question is whether they’ve already turned the page.” the demonstration on saturday, one of more than 900 planned around the world to call attention to economic inequality, gave

but it was also a harbinger of future violence, and a glimpse of how mr. trump, who has promised to bring the country together, seems to have united americans only in stirring their passion and anger. photo what we are witnessing now is complicated, with few obvious heroes. at times, both sides have behaved badly. trump supporters are quick to turn on protesters, especially those who don’t look like them. they point and holler. sometimes they spit and kick and shove. a young black woman in kentucky was pushed and called names, her sign ripped from her hands. a black man in north carolina was sucker-punched by a 78-year-old white man, who later looked into a camera and warned that next time, “we might have to kill him.” to witness the crowd turn on the protesters in its midst is to watch a feverish body, bucking and writhing as it tries to eject an invading virus. i have talked to protesters who still don’t quite have the words to describe what they felt when they were singled out and turned upon, often by their communities. mr. trump says he condemns violence. but he also shouts at his crowds to “get ’em out!” and even when he urges them not to hurt the protesters, a hard edge of menace bullets his words. yet the protesters, too, have sometimes instigated the clashes. they fling themselves to the ground, forcing law enforcement officers — often outmanned and

“if we allow a sitting parliament to extend its term for these months, this may happen again and again,” said giorgi khaindrava, a former government minister who is now in the opposition. “changing their term while in office violates a fundamental principle of democratic systems.” the demonstration signaled a significant degree of popular discontent with mr. saakashvili and his government, which inherited a country in near ruin four years ago and embarked upon an ambitious set of reforms. mr. saakashvili, a lawyer educated at columbia university, has steered his post-soviet country sharply toward the west, seeking admission to nato and the european union, while moving against corruption at home, especially in the police. he has often said he hoped to model his country’s development after the experience of the eastern european countries that were once under the kremlin’s yoke, and to bring democracy and free markets to the caucasus, a region with a history of corrupt, brutal and autocratic governments. he has set new standards for education, increased tax collection and revenue-generation, improved the readiness of the country’s once feeble army and repaired soviet-era infrastructure to the degree that the country, once plagued by blackouts, now has a reliable electricity supply. but some of the reforms have made him enemies, and he has alienated several prominent politicians, who find him domineering and abrasive. his opponents accuse him of hoarding and abusing power, and of running

Article 3 - what the world cup can teach about corruption
(before it's news) fighting corruption is a proven means to reduce inequality. but the issue has often been co-opted by elites looking to do just the opposite. walden bello brazil’s crushing world cup loss to germany’s world champion team wasn’t just bad news for brazilian football fans. it’s also likely to reignite the anger that many brazilians felt towards the government of president dilma rousseff for hosting such a spectacular eventwhen it could hardly afford decent public transport and social services for its citizens. corruption is also part of the explosive narrative. in the most expensive world cup ever, millions of brazilian taxpayer dollars went into corruption-plagued construction projects, including a new bridge in belo horizonte—site of the humiliating dismantling of brazil by germany—which has already collapsed. photo: sebástian freire / flickr with brazil stuck with a $$14-billion price tag and fifa—probably the most corrupt international sports body in the world—clearing a $$2-billion, tax-free profit, it is hard to see how rousseff’s center-left government can survive the coming blowback. in many ways, the episode encapsulates the complex relationship between the politics of progressivism and corruption in the developing world. corruption as unifying issue apart from passionate support for their national sports teams, hatred of government corruption and “crony capitalism” is one of the few issues that unite all social groups in developing countries. corruption is often the main

iceland’s economy recovers by going after the banksters, while europe’s malaise continues and the us barrels toward collapse (before it's news) by sarah lyall © andrew testa for the new york times reykjavik, iceland – for a country that four years ago plunged into a financial abyss so deep it all but shut down overnight, iceland seems to be doing surprisingly well. it has repaid, early, many of the international loans that kept it afloat. unemployment is hovering around 6 percent, and falling. and while much of europe is struggling to pull itself out of the recessionary swamp, iceland’s economy is expected to grow by 2.8 percent this year. “everything has turned around,” said adalheidur hedinsdottir, who owns and runs the coffee chain kaffitar, the starbucks of iceland, and has plans to open a new cafe and start a bakery business. “when we told the bank we wanted to make a new company, they said, ‘do you want to borrow money?’ ” she went on. “we haven’t been hearing that for a while.” analysts attribute the surprising turn of events to a combination of fortuitous decisions and good luck, and caution that the lessons of iceland’s turnaround are not readily applicable to the larger and more complex economies of europe. but during the crisis, the country did many things different from its european counterparts. it let its three

Article 8 - is bitcoin the answer?
what is money? strangely, for something with which we are all so familiar, not one person in a thousand could explain what money really is where it comes from the fundamentals of how it moves between businesses, banks and countries to really understand this most of us need to discard some things we long thought we understood. but when you finally see what’s going on it is extraordinarily satisfying. money – of a sort – arises naturally in the animal kingdom. chimpanzees trade a variety of delayed and highly valued favours which it would be impolite to describe. south american vampire bats run a small economy which pays in blood. the little darlings have such a need for their daily dose that they lend, borrow and pay back amongst themselves rather than let a close relative go fatally bloodless for a whole night. these animal transactions contain the seed of money in so far as a favour is performed, and the favour due back, the ‘credit’, which it generates, is stored up and repaid later. the plastic cards we use are poorly named. they should be called credit-and-debt cards, because although you can spend the credit bit you may have noticed they leave the debt bit overhanging. to get just the spending power, without the debt which goes with it, we usually need to do some work, or possibly provide somebody with something in a sale. either way, we too generate an unreturned favour, which we usually try to store up until we demand its return – probably from

Article 1 - u.s. inquiry of drug makers is widened
now, prosecutors are investigating whether the payments made to doctors who conducted these studies abroad were appropriate. if evidence shows that such payments have influenced the results of some clinical trials, prosecutors will be inspecting the trials closely, mr. ogrosky said. an article about the inquiry appeared friday in the financial times. last month, a federal drug official reported that he found repeated instances in a landmark clinical trial of avandia, a controversial diabetes medicine, in which patients taking avandia appeared to suffer serious heart problems that were not counted in the study’s crucial tally of adverse events. many of the study’s trial sites were in foreign countries, and the study is a main reason that avandia remains on the market in the united states. government officials have not accused glaxosmithkline, the trial’s sponsor, of fraud. “at the justice department, investigations that involve allegations of patient harm rise straight to the top and will attract the immediate attention of the f.b.i.,” mr. ogrosky said. the pharmaceutical industry may be more vulnerable to such investigations because its representatives overseas work on a daily basis with officials or doctors employed by state health systems. because pharmaceutical companies “are in the health care sector and because, in so many foreign countries, heath sector employees could be considered foreign officials, there is a heightened risk there,” said jay darden, a washington lawyer and former federal prosecutor who specialized in health care and foreign corrupt practice cases. but, he said

Article 2 - documents show kpmg secretly met prosecutors
the previously unseen notes convey the twists and turns of a legal drama, for sure — but for some criminal defense lawyers, their language bolsters the contention that the prosecution of kpmg was particularly zealous. kpmg fulfilled a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the government last december and avoided criminal charges, but the effects of its ordeal continue. the handling of the case has significant implications for the prosecution of its former employees, as well as for a criminal case against deutsche bank, which is under federal investigation into its tax shelter work. no charges have been filed against it. the federal judge overseeing the prosecution of the former kpmg employees on criminal tax shelter charges has said that the government was coercive and violated the constitutional rights of the defendants by pressing kpmg to cut off payment of their legal fees as a condition of avoiding indictment itself. but to other legal observers, the notes of the discussions also highlight the gray areas between coercion and cooperation that typify corporate criminal investigations. “there’s a lot of posturing going on on both sides,” said peter henning, a former lawyer in the justice department’s criminal fraud division, after reviewing the notes. “the government was threatening to put kpmg out of business, but i don’t think they were serious.” the first meeting between kpmg and the prosecution described in the notes took place on march 2, 2005, at the manhattan office of federal prosecutors for the southern district of new york. advertisement continue

Article 3 - as scandal unfolds, g.m. calls in the lawyers
for one, some of the firm’s lawyers may have to ask their own colleagues if they advised g.m. about whether to recall the vehicles at the time the melton case was settled. “they are part of the story,” said mr. cooper, whose firm is based in marietta, ga. there is a predictable trajectory to the modern institutional scandal: charges of wrongdoing surface, then mount, and then the company announces that it will bring in an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation. the announcement, made in sober, corporate language, sends a calming message: we’re not hiding. we’re taking this seriously. we’ve got this. hiring outside counsel in these cases is part investigation, part public-relations gambit and part legal strategy. in most cases, the goal isn’t to publicly flog a company or its top executives, but rather to limit damage to an institution’s reputation or to contain the financial harm to shareholders of a publicly traded company. and it does so under the protection of the attorney-client privilege. from the point of view of the company, a well-done internal investigation can shape the accepted story of what happened — and produce findings that allow the company to negotiate for lower penalties from prosecutors or regulators down the road. to achieve those ends, the law firms conducting the investigations must be viewed as forthright and uncompromised. in this respect, some critics have already questioned g.m.’s choices. the g.m. investigation will be led by anton r

Article 4 - malaysia and the trans-pacific partnership trade pact
to the editor: re “justice dept. rejects account of how malaysia’s leader acquired millions” (news article, july 23): i’ve been following your coverage of the scandal in malaysia, in which $700 million in government funds was moved to a bank account controlled by the prime minister and billions more to the accounts of others close to him. the justice department has just moved to seize $1 billion of these embezzled assets located in the united states. it would be easy to dismiss this situation as just another example of corruption halfway around the world, but in this case malaysia is a party to the pending trans-pacific partnership trade agreement. if approved, the tpp would give malaysia privileged access to the united states market in return for access to theirs. setting aside the unbalanced nature of that proposition, this scandal raises serious doubts about whether malaysia can live up to its end of the bargain. our state department has turned a blind eye to malaysia’s complicity in human trafficking, but the justice department’s recent actions underscore why we shouldn’t enter into economic partnership with bad actors like malaysia. this is one of hundreds of reasons congress should reject the tpp. louise slaughter rochester the writer, a democrat, represents new york’s 25th district in the house.

Article 5 - obama takes tougher antitrust line
the administration is hoping to encourage smaller companies in an array of industries to bring their complaints to the justice department about potentially improper business practices by their larger rivals. some of the biggest antitrust cases were initiated by complaints taken to the justice department. ms. varney said that the administration rejected the impulse to go easy on antitrust enforcement during weak economic times. instead, she said, severe recessions can provide dangerous incentives for large and dominating companies to engage in predatory behavior that harms consumers and weakens competition. “there is no adequate substitute for a competitive market, particularly during times of economic distress,” she said. “vigorous antitrust enforcement must play a significant role in the government’s response to economic crises to ensure that markets remain competitive.” the announcement is aimed at making sure that no court or party to a lawsuit can cite the bush administration policy as the government’s official view in any pending cases. ms. varney warned judges and litigants in antitrust lawsuits not involving the government to ignore the bush administration’s policies, which were formally outlined in a report by the justice department last year. the report applied legal standards that made it difficult to bring new cases involving monopoly and predatory practices. as a result of the bush administration’s interpretation of antitrust laws, the enforcement pipeline for major monopoly cases — which can take years for prosecutors to develop — is thin. during the bush administration, the justice department did not file a single case against a dominant firm for violating the antimonopoly law. advertisement

the imam and former spiritual leader of an islamic community center and mosque near ground zero is accused in a new lawsuit of defrauding donors to his nonprofit organizations of millions of dollars, using the money for personal real estate, lavish trips and a luxury sports car. the suit against the imam, feisal abdul rauf, was filed on monday in state supreme court in manhattan by robert leslie deak, a major donor to the imam’s nonprofit organizations, the cordoba initiative and the american society for muslim advancement. mr. deak said in the suit that he donated $167,000 between 2006 and 2008 to a project to combat anti-muslim sentiment. instead, the suit alleges, mr. abdul rauf used the money for entertainment and other personal purposes. the lawsuit also accuses the organizations of not reporting on their tax returns approximately $3 million that the malaysian government donated to the two organizations. instead, according to the suit, that money was also taken by mr. abdul rauf for his personal use. advertisement continue reading the main story jonathan nelson, the lawyer for mr. deak and his wife, moshira solimon, said that his clients first began to suspect in 2010 that fraud had taken place, and that they had “gathered the information in bits and pieces” by april 2011. the couple are asking for $5 million in punitive damages.

Article 8 - australia suit over wheat for iraq
sydney, australia — six australian businessmen face the possibility of millions of dollars in fines in a new civil case connected with huge bribes paid to the government of saddam hussein. the men could also face criminal proceedings, but because the statute of limitations expires earlier for civil suits than for criminal cases, the authorities moved first on the civil action. the six men are all former senior managers of the australian wheat board, which an independent inquiry last year found had paid some $250 million in bribes to the iraqi government just as australian troops were preparing to go to war. the bribes, which the board paid to secure contracts to supply wheat under the united nations oil-for-food program, were disguised as transport fees paid to a jordanian trucking company partly owned by mr. hussein’s ministry of transport, the inquiry reported. advertisement continue reading the main story “the australian securities and investments commission alleges that the defendants contravened section 180 of the corporations act, which requires company officers to act with care and diligence, and section 181, which requires company officers to discharge their duties in good faith and for a proper purpose,” the commission said wednesday.

Key points such as technical glitches, waivers, subsidies, and executive orders are not present in the article. Instead, the article discusses a study by the National Center for Policy Analysis finding that free competition would benefit Americans who fill a dozen prescriptions a year, contradicting the focus on ACA implementation in the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY. The tone of the article also suggests a critical view of regulations and government overreach, which is not present in the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY.","The articles discuss various issues related to the US healthcare system, specifically the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its implementation. Key points include:

* The ACA's rollout was marred by technical glitches, with some estimates suggesting that the website's costs increased by 29% before it even started operating.
* Congress had initially sought a waiver from the law, but ultimately decided to proceed with implementing it.
* President Obama's administration had promised ""no bailouts"" and ""no handouts,"" but later provided subsidies to certain industries, including ethanol and manufacturing.
* The ACA's subsidies were estimated to total over $1 trillion by 2022, up from an initial estimate of $814 billion.
* Executive orders signed by President Trump aimed to reduce the ACA's subsidies and promote competition in the healthcare market.
* House Republicans had initially sought to defund the ACA, but ultimately settled for a symbolic vote that left the law intact.

Overall, these articles highlight the complexities and challenges surrounding the implementation of the ACA, as well as the ongoing debates over its role in the US healthcare system.","The articles discuss various aspects of the US healthcare system and politics. Article 1 highlights that Democrats need to rethink their approach to reach moderate swing voters, focusing on economic growth. 

Article 2 critiques Obama's health plan, stating that electronic health information technology and prevention programs may not save money in the long run. It suggests considering a single-payer system like Medicare.

Article 3 notes a shift towards populism among Democrats, with proposals reflecting concerns about jobs, healthcare affordability, and education costs. This contrasts with Republican policies, which prioritize free trade and tax cuts.

Article 1 - america r.i.p. 1776 – 2012
america r.i.p. 1776 – 2012 (before it's news) barack obama addressing a joint session of congress (state of the union-like) on the night of february 24, 2009. standing in front of vice president joe biden (left) and speaker of the house nancy pelosi (right). (photo credit: wikipedia) america has made her decision. progressives, liberals and low information voters ruled the day and decided that barack obama’s record of epic failure and malaise was good enough. this motley coalition of “me-first” malcontents and fairness hustlers was enough to push pharaoh obama over the top and into another four years of despotic rule where executive orders pass for law and lies pass for the truth. we, the god fearing patriots of the united states of america felt like the country deserved better but in the end our efforts were in vain except for the inner contentment that comes with knowing you did all you could do. in the end it was not enough and the country was taken off life support where most of us expect her to die a slow and agonizing death as the cancer of redistribution, excessive regulation and corruption eats away at her. the country will not survive this. there will not after four more years be a way to pull the country back from the brink as it will have long since passed the point of no return. as middle aged people enter their third or fourth year of

Article 2 - letter of support for the no special treatment for congress act, h.r. 3071
letter of support for the no special treatment for congress act, h.r. 3071 (before it's news) dear freedomworks member, as one of our millions of freedomworks members nationwide, i urge you to contact your representative and tell him or her to support the no special treatment for congress act, h.r. 3071. introduced by congressman phil gingrey (r-ga), this bill would stop members of congress, their staff and all executive branch employees from receiving any subsides beyond those that would be received by other citizens of the united states under obamacare. under section 1312 of the affordable care act, congress and their staff were to be enrolled in health insurance exchange plans, just like every ordinary american, and would lose their existing privileged coverage in the popular and successful federal employees health benefits program (fehbp). but rather than accept the consequences of passing obamacare, the political class of washington, d.c., who passed the law that fewer than 40% of all americans support, have decided to exempt themselves from obamacare. and the most offensive fact is that they’ve received this special treatment without even transparent vote for the american people to see. the president, acting with questionable legal authority through the federal office of personnel management, has declared that members of congress and their staff can effectively be exempt from the law. while they must still enroll in obamacare’s exchanges, the president is allowing congress to keep their gold-plated insurance subsidies that pay up to

Article 3 - desperate congress realizes they're getting obamacare, seeks a waiver
desperate congress realizes they're getting obamacare, seeks a waiver (before it's news) for years, congress has enjoyed a fantastic health benefits program, better than that of most americans. but during the debate over obamacare, senator chuck grassley (r-ia) managed to get language into the bill that requires members of congress and their staff to purchase their insurance through a government-run health insurance exchange like every other citizen under obamacare. naturally, some members of congress were none too happy about this, and lo and behold, politico reported earlier this year that congressional leaders have quietly been looking for a way to exempt themselves from receiving the same (inferior) health benefits that they have foisted upon those who elected them. this hypocrisy is made possible by a flaw in the grassley amendment, which unfortunately is not absolutely specific regarding whether congress is to receive the same (inferior) levels of insurance premium subsidies as other americans, or the same (generous) subsidies it always has. the insurance premium subsidies under obamacare are not nearly as generous as what congress is currently receiving – so, naturally, some members have been looking for a way to keep their old, special deal. the grassley amendment’s ambiguity has left the hypocrites with a big opening for mischief. congressmen and staffers are anxiously awaiting official word on this issue from the office of personnel management (opm), which administers the federal employees health benefits (fehb) plan and has the power to

Article 4 - no more bipartisan bailouts by michael d. tanner
no more bipartisan bailouts by michael d. tanner (before it's news) one of the few lines in president obama’s state of the union address that actually received bipartisan applause was his vow of “no bailouts, no handouts, and no cop outs.” of course the president then went on to claim credit for his bailout of the auto industry and promise additional handouts to the “green energy” industry. both liberals and conservatives often succumb to a narrative that pits big government against big business. no doubt many of big government’s tax and regulatory policies do make it more difficult for businesses to expand and hire people. but just as often, big business and big government are all too happy to work hand in hand to thwart the free market.confusing support for free markets with support for the corporate agenda is a bipartisan failing. in a free market, for example, corporations compete against one another on their merits. government doesn’t pick winners and losers or prefer one type of industry over another. yet, rick santorum shares president obama’s desire for special tax breaks for “manufacturing.” both newt gingrich and mitt romney join president obama in backing government subsidies for ethanol and other alternative energy. and obviously, in a free market, when businesses fail because they made stupid investment decisions, they go bankrupt. but both romney and gingrich joined president obama (and president bush) in supporting tarp and the bailout of some of america’s biggest banks and investment

Article 5 - glitches? not really
glitches? not really (before it's news) president obama and his supporters had been singing a happy tune even after the disastrous rollout of the health insurance exchanges. that’s changing. this video shows why: this partial transcript should highlight why the obama administration should be firing consultants: luke chung: it wasn’t designed well. it wasn’t implemented well. it looks like nobody tested it. jan crawford: luke chung’s company builds online database programs. he supports the new health care law. he says it’s not demand that’s crashing healthcare.gov. the entire website needs a complete overhaul. luke chung: it’s not close. it’s not even ready for beta testing from my book. i would be ashamed and embarassed if my organization delivered something like that. couple that with this video of robert gibbs calling the rollout of the affordable care act’s health insurance exchanges and there’s a disaster brewing: these problems are fixable with time, though it’ll take months, not days or weeks to fix what’s been ‘implemented’, not to mention the beta testing and implementing the major fixes to the exchanges. the biggest problem is the product itself, which i wrote about here: another person shared a link found on the federal government’s main obamacare page listing premium estimates for small business employers: the information is not very complete as i don’t see anything about deductible or other detailed info, but it does given an actual price as to the “premium.”

Article 6 - obamacare exchange costs up 29% before program even starts!
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! one of the big features of the affordable care act (a.k.a. health-care reform or obamacare) is the creation of exchanges where people can buy subsidized insurance plans. there’s a raft of implementation issues as states try to figure out whether they want to set up their own exchanges or go along with federal ones. here’s something that only makes 2014, the year obamacare fully comes online, even more dread-worthy: the estimated cost of subsidizing plans through obamacare’s exchanges has grown from $3,970 in 2010 to $5,510. here’s john merline of investors business: the cbo’s new baseline estimate shows that obamacare subsidies offered through the insurance exchanges — which are supposed to be up and running by next january — will total more than $1 trillion through 2022, up from $814 billion over those same years in its budget forecast made a year ago. that’s an increase of nearly 29%… last year, the cbo said the average exchange subsidy for those getting federal help when obamacare goes into effect next year would be $4,780. its latest estimate raised that to $5,510 — a 15% increase. all these numbers are up even more from the cbo’s original forecast made in 2010, which had the first-year subsidy average at $3,970. the cbo also expects 7 million workers will lose their employer

Article 7 - trump obamacare executive orders: an analysis and opinion
trump obamacare executive orders: an analysis and opinion (before it's news) this is a long analysis, so if you’d like to read the key summary, here you go: it’s kind of like this. you have two problems in your single engine plane that is magically being kept afloat even though it really is not fit for flying. the reason it is not fit for flying is the government has created regulations that cause you to point the ailerons always down, as well as regulations that don’t allow you to attach a propeller to your plane. the plane is being held up in the air by a giant jumbo liner that’s about four times as expensive to fly as the single engine plane you have. that would be all the subsidies in the system. along comes donny with his executive orders that take away the jumbo plane and allow you to add the prop. what happens? well, the plane shoots right towards the ground. everyone aboard the plane is screaming for their very lives. then along comes the next president, or maybe a veto-proof congress, and they say, hey, see what we told you? you need government. this is why it is evil to take government out of healthcare. the plane will crash. tell you what – let’s make a bigger jumbo liner to carry this plane and for the love of humanity, get that freaking propeller off the plane. the people in the plane rejoice that they have been saved by the government, not

Article 8 - house republicans have hurt their chance to defund obamacare
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! from former congressman ernest istook via washington times – washington, october 2, 2013 — republicans in the u.s. house of representatives may have painted themselves into a corner. they evidently will settle for symbolism to end the ongoing government slowdown. that would leave virtually all of obamacare intact and more difficult than ever to defund or repeal. the most-recent house vote lowered the gop’s demand significantly. the original vote (plan a) coupled funding for the rest of government with a defunding of obamacare. the second vote late sunday night (plan b) offered to fund all of government in exchange for two things: a) a one-year delay in the individual mandate, plus b) enforcement of the requirement that congress get its own insurance through obamacare. by lowering their goals voluntarily, the gop has reduced the chance that they will accomplish anything substantive rather than symbolic regarding obamacare. rather than accepting plan b, the white house is standing back while the media trashes and blames republicans for what is called a shutdown. (huge parts of “essential” government remain on-the-job, so” slowdown” is a term that fits much better.) when obama figures he’s gathered enough election year ammunition, he could pivot. posturing as magnanimous, obama would need only minor negotiations to close a deal along the lines of plan b. the house essentially has backed down to

Article 1 - where do democrats go next?
and we were too deferential to our most zealous supporters. during election season, congress sought to placate those on the extreme left and motivate the base — but that meant that our final efforts before the election focused on trying to allow gays in the military, change our immigration system and repeal the george w. bush-era tax cuts. these are legitimate issues but unlikely to resonate with moderate swing voters in a season of economic discontent. with these lessons in mind, democrats can begin to rebuild. where to start? first, we have more than a communications problem — the public heard us but disagreed with our approach. democrats need not reassess our goals for america, but we need to seriously rethink how to reach them. second, don’t blame the voters. they aren’t stupid or addled by fear. they are skeptical about government efficacy, worried about the deficit and angry that democrats placed other priorities above their main concern: economic growth. so, in the near term, every policy must be viewed through a single prism: does it help the economy grow? newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. a good place to start

Article 2 - obama’s health plan, dissected
easton, conn., july 23, 2008  to the editor: barack obama proposes to make health care affordable for all americans with an injection of cash from the repeal of the bush tax cuts and with savings realized from electronic health information technology and programs to improve disease prevention and chronic disease management. while better record-keeping and prevention and management programs would improve the quality of our medical system, there is little data that they would actually save money. they certainly would not do so for many years. most waste in our health care system is a result of our reliance on private health insurers. having multiple competing insurers results in costs for marketing, underwriting, billing, claims adjudication, executive salaries and profit. administrative costs account for 31 percent of all health care spending in the united states, but only 17 percent in canada’s single payer system. the administrative costs of america’s own single-payer system, medicare, are only about 3 percent, compared with 12 to 15 percent for private insurers. if mr. obama wants to save enough to provide health care for every american, he needs to open the debate to include consideration of medicare for all in the united states. rachel nardin photo cambridge, mass., july 23, 2008 the writer, an assistant professor of neurology at harvard medical school, is chairwoman of the massachusetts chapter of physicians for a national health program.  to the

Article 3 - a new populism spurs democrats on the economy
their language, and to some degree their proposals, reflect a striking contrast with the approach taken by democrats during much of the 1990s, when president bill clinton asserted that trade would create american jobs and that paying attention to the concerns of wall street would help the economy by lowering interest rates. the more populist tone is one indication of a broader debate among democrats over economic policy and how much they should break with the careful centrism of the clinton years embodied by robert e. rubin, the former treasury secretary, who was a champion of free trade and cutting deficits. so far, republicans have, by and large, stuck by their free-market philosophy. they point to a rebounding stock market, declining deficits and steady if unspectacular economic expansion as evidence that conservative policies of tax cutting, less regulation and more trade are working. but democrats say they are responding to economic trends that the statistics in the headlines do not capture, including middle-class insecurity about jobs, the affordability of health insurance and the costs of education. the times have changed, these democrats argue, and six years of republican tax and economic policies have heightened the inequities. even as mrs. clinton has sought to associate herself with the economic growth of her husband’s administration, she, like other democratic presidential candidates, has been expressing a sharp skepticism toward trade and globalization under president bush. in recent weeks she has announced her opposition to the proposed south korean free trade agreement and denounced globalization

Article 4 - ‘essential benefits’ and health reform
the obama administration surprised supporters and critics when it decided to let states define the “essential health benefits” that must be provided to their citizens under health care reform. the move could lessen opposition in republican-led states and increase the chances that they will move ahead on building new health insurance exchanges to comply with the reform law. the impact on most consumers may be minimal. even the most fiercely antiregulation states will not be free to approve extremely miserly policies, because they will have to be comparable to popular and fairly comprehensive “benchmark” private plans. there are concerns that insurance company lobbyists — who are even more powerful in many states than in washington — will find ways to shape requirements to favor their bottom lines rather than consumers. in the longer run, it would be better to set a national standard. that would also be easier for federal regulators to monitor. the health care reform law requires private health insurers that sell policies to individuals and small businesses to provide, starting in 2014, a set of “essential health benefits” in 10 categories, including hospitalization, ambulatory care, maternity care, prescription drugs and laboratory services. the law also said the benefits should be comparable to those provided under “a typical employer plan.” but it left it up to the secretary of health and human services to define what benefits are “essential” and what employer plans are “typical.” now secretary kathleen sebelius has passed those decisions to the states, at least for a two-year transition

Article 5 - the supreme court’s ruling on the health law
photo to the editor: the supreme court has read some sloppy legislation in a way most beneficial to millions of americans now covered by medical insurance with the help of a federal subsidy. many politicians will also benefit as a result. since the passage of the affordable health care act, republican opponents of the obama administration have made the act public enemy no. 1. however, as affordable health care has begun to settle in, its political value as a target has increasingly waned. had the supreme court negated the federal subsidy system, republican candidates would have had to answer for the mayhem that was sure to follow. the court’s sane reading of the act has removed that political burden. more important, the nation should now be able to move forward with insured health care as a permanent part of the lives of millions of americans previously left by the side of the road. there will, i hope, be improvements to come, but the debate should now forever turn from health care as a privilege to health care as an entitlement and how best to maintain it. advertisement continue reading the main story bruce neuman sag harbor, n.y. to the editor: the supreme court accepted a case that was based on the notion that a few ambiguous words in a law — “an exchange established by the state” — meant that the law did not mean what the people who wrote it and those who voted for it thought it meant. three justices were willing to support that point of view. that is truly shocking

Article 6 - can we afford it?
republican critics have a fiercely argued list of reasons to oppose health care reform. one that is resonating is that the nation cannot afford in tough economic times to add a new trillion-dollar health care entitlement. we understand why americans may be skittish, but the argument is at best disingenuous and at worst a flat misrepresentation. over the next two decades, the pending bills would actually reduce deficits by a small amount and reforms in how medical care is delivered and paid for  begun now on a small scale  could significantly reduce future deficits. here is a closer look at the benefits and costs of health care reform: status quo is unsustainable more than 46 million americans have no insurance, and millions more have such poor coverage that a severe illness threatens bankruptcy. small employers are dropping coverage because of the cost. those lucky enough to have insurance are struggling with higher premiums and co-payments, and worry that if they are laid off they could lose coverage. without reform, that bad situation will only get worse. the commonwealth fund, a respected research organization, warned that the average premium for family coverage in employer-sponsored policies would almost double in the coming decade, from about $12,300 in 2008 to $23,800 in 2020, with part paid by workers and part by employers. premiums are also soaring for individuals who buy their own coverage directly. but a trillion dollars? both the house and senate bills would cover more than 30 million of

Article 7 - ‘i will give you everything.’ here are 282 of donald trump’s campaign promises.
in donald trump’s final days on the campaign trail, he promised his supporters that “every dream you ever dreamed for your country” will come true if he becomes president — one of dozens of sweeping promises he made and is now expected to fulfill. in january, i compiled a list of 76 campaign promises trump had made. since then, the list has grown to 282, collected from trump’s speeches, public comments, tweets and campaign and transition websites. jobs 1) create at least 25 million jobs and “be the greatest jobs president that god ever created.” 2) bring back manufacturing jobs from china, mexico, japan and elsewhere. states that can expect a rush of jobs include pennsylvania, north carolina, michigan, ohio, florida, new hampshire, iowa, nevada, new york and virginia. 3) encourage manufacturers to build or grow factories in the united states with tax incentives . 4) refuse to eat another oreo until nabisco fully moves production back to the united states from mexico. 5) tell ford’s president that unless he cancels plans to build a massive plant in mexico, the auto company will face a 35 percent tax on cars imported back into the united states. trump is confident he can get this done before taking office. (trump has twice incorrectly said this has already happened.) 6) “get apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in

Article 8 - republicans must keep promise to repeal obamacare
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse ken blackwell is the senior fellow for family empowerment at the family research council, and the ronald reagan distinguished fellow for public policy at the buckeye institute in columbus, ohio as the legendary robert novak once said, ""god put the republican party on earth to cut taxes. if they don't do that, they have no useful function."" president donald trump has promised bold reagan-like tax cuts to spur economic growth. however, with health care premiums skyrocketing and the devastating effect on businesses, america desperately needs to repeal the obamacare tax. for seven years, congressional republicans on the campaign trail promised to repeal former president barack obama's signature healthcare legislation. now, after a historic election, what is the delay? the ""fake news"" media spin is to blame this on the conservative freedom caucus, including my friend rep. jim jordan (r-oh) for standing on principal and demanding a full repeal of obamacare. but the real blame belongs to so-called centrists and the d.c. establishment that has worked too closely with the insurance industry to defend many of the healthcare law's worst mandates. and the same obamacare-repeal bills that congress repeatedly passed during the obama-era are now ignored. the republican leadership has put president trump in an uncomfortable situation, presenting him with potential bills that are far from ideal and do not

Title: captain obvious in da house
Content: as bob spent most of the morning pointing out ( here and here ), the obamatax does little but increase our costs; whether they’re called premiums or taxes is of little consequence to our checkbooks. a new study by the national center for policy analysis finds that, contra-obamatax expectations, “americans, who on average fill a dozen prescriptions a year, would benefit from free competition.” no kidding. in some ways, this is the fox butterfield effect hard at work: “[t]he study argues that the many new regulations, often enacted in the name of protecting consumers, are having the opposite effect, placing barriers to efficiency“ that is – and this will be no surprise to regular ib readers – the regs are there specifically to create those barriers. anyone who’s been paying attention the past 3 years understands this: decreased efficiency leads to more regulations, and thus more government overreach. but then, that’s been the real game all along.

Article 3 - mets should give juan lagares job in center
mets should give juan lagares job in center headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! juan lagares deserves to start on opening day for the mets. with opening day approaching, the new york mets still have lingering questions to answer. one is in center field, where they face what many have seen as a tough choice between eric young jr. and juan lagares. mets manager terry collins is known to prefer young as his leadoff hitter. young’s speed and hustle sparked the team in the second half of the 2013 season, and he led the national league in stolen bases. he also made numerous spectacular catches to save runs and end innings. however, despite the stellar plays, young is an average-at-best outfielder. his fantastic catches sometimes result from poor reads, and his throwing arm is not strong. as a hitter, despite the energy and excitement he provides, his .251 batting average wasn’t what one would hope for at the top of the order. he did, however, get on base at a more acceptable rate of .318. juan lagares appears to be a future perennial gold glove outfielder. he gets excellent jumps and covers tremendous ground. his arm is one of the best in the business. he plays hard, and he always seems to do something to make his pitcher’s night easier. the problem with lagares has generally been spotty hitting. he batted .242 last season

nate’s takes: alex rodriugez, jorge posada, september call-ups, bartolo colon (before it's news) alex rodriguez is back inthe lineup and it will be interesting to see if he can hit 30 home runs againthis season. he always seems to find a way to do it. how much fun is watching curtis granderson and mark teixeira try to outdo each otherwith home runs? now imagine if a-rod was in on their friendly competition. is it too soon to put jorge posada back as the full-time dh? itseems as though the second joe girarditook him out of the lineup he started hitting. we are approachingseptember 1st call-ups. if you were the yankees, who would you callup? i would take a backup catcher (jesusmontero), another lefty (steve garrisonor raul valdes), a backup infielder (brandonlaird) and another outfielder or two (greggolson and chris dickerson). it is time for bartolo colon to showing the yankeessome more if he wants to be the no. 2 starter in the playoffs. he started theseason on fire and after coming back from the dl has been effective, but notthe same. the yankees have a quickthree-game homestand versus oakland before hitting the road to play the oriolesand red

red sox report: grady sizemore shakes up opening day roster headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! grady sizemore is in line to open the season as boston’s center fielder. (michael ivins/getty images) when the boston red sox signed grady sizemore in late january, it was a depth move. a one-year, $750,000 contract with up to $6 million in incentives was about what could be expected for a player who last saw regular playing time in july of 2011, almost three years ago. although the red sox opened camp with the expectation that prospect jackie bradley, jr. would be manning center field following the departure of jacoby ellsbury, those expectations have changed. a year ago, it was bradley jr.’s hot spring that forced the red sox hand, and allowed him to start the season in the majors. now, it’s another new face’s strong spring that is complicating john farrell’s opening day roster. the red sox signed sizemore with the intention of stashing him in triple-a, or possibly keeping him as the fifth outfielder, should they move mike carp or someone got injured. having not played baseball in over two years seemed reason enough to not expect the former mvp-candidate to make much of an impact. but then spring training started. as of march 19

Title: m.l.s. suspends two red bulls
Content: the red bulls, who are battling for a playoff spot in major league soccer, will play the final two games of the regular season without two starters — goalkeeper jon conway and defender jeff parke — after both were suspended thursday by the league for violating its substance-abuse policy, the first drug suspensions in league history. the two players were suspended for 10 games, including the balance of the regular season and the playoffs, and fined 10 percent of their salaries after testing positive for androstatriendione and boldenone metabolites, performance-enhancing substances that were purchased over the counter at a vitamin store that is part of a national chain. conway’s salary this season is $115,000; parke was due to earn $58,487. the red bulls (9-10-9, 36 points), who are vying for one of two wild-card playoff berths, play columbus on saturday before ending their regular season thursday at the chicago fire. conway had started and played every minute of the red bulls’ 28 games this season. parke, who has been with the club since 2004, has appeared in 24 matches this season. “we have met with both players and they informed us that they ingested an over-the-counter supplement that unknowingly contained a banned substance,” erik stover, the red bulls’ managing director, said in a statement. “however, the red bulls support m.l.s.’s policy and believe that performance-enhancing drugs have no place in professional sports.” jack bell

Article 1 - national academy revises its policies
the association in turn offered to help the academy work through its problems, but made no pledge to remove penalties. “there are no promises about the lifting of sanctions, nor was there a request to do so — sanctions never came up,” said michael conforti, president of the museum directors’ association, in an interview. “but clearly this is a step in the process of re-engaging the academy as a member in good standing.” the academy’s sale of the two paintings — frederic edwin church’s “scene on the magdalene,” from 1854, and sanford robinson gifford’s “mount mansfield, vermont,” from 1859 — came shortly before brandeis university’s january announcement that it would close its rose art museum and sell its collection to help shore up the university’s finances. (brandeis has since said it would form a committee to consider the future of the museum.) together those decisions spurred concerns that more institutions would follow suit. new york assemblyman richard l. brodsky, a westchester county democrat and brandeis alumnus, has introduced legislation with the state board of regents to set deaccessioning guidelines for new york museums. “this is going to smack us in the face, as more cultural institutions face the consequences of the fiscal crisis,” mr. brodsky said. “we need a reasoned, responsible set of laws.” michael botwinick, executive director of the hudson

Article 2 - the modern finds a temporary home in queens
the museum of modern art, one of manhattan's top cultural landmarks, is picking up and moving to long island city in queens this summer, hoping that tourists and art lovers will follow. the museum, on west 53rd street, closes its doors on tuesday and they will stay shut for three years, awaiting completion of the japanese architect yoshio taniguchi's new and enlarged version. on june 29, the doors will open at moma queens or qns, shorthand for the modern's new site at 33rd street and queens boulevard. visitors arriving from manhattan on the no. 7 subway line, which stops directly across the street, will know they have arrived when they see the giant letters moma on the building's roof. the temporary museum, which began life as a staple factory, has been painted bright blue on the outside, and on the inside has been reconfigured to provide gallery space for changing exhibits as well as a sampling of masterworks from the modern's permanent collections, such as van gogh's ''starry night'' (1889) and picasso's ''demoiselles d'avignon'' (1907). this summer, the modern will take advantage of the wide, sweeping spaces at the queens site and present for the first time its collection of automobiles, including the oldest, pininfarina's cisitalia 202 gt (1946), and arguably its fastest, ferrari's formula 1 racing car

Article 4 - rockwell’s children sue berkshire museum to stop sale of his works
“this move is also antithetical to the museum’s stated charitable purpose, and is financially unnecessary,” michael b. keating, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. photo lawyers for the plaintiffs have asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the auctions, which are to be handled by sotheby’s. the two paintings by norman rockwell, the most valuable among the works for sale, are scheduled to be offered on nov. 13. nineteen works are set to be auctioned by march, with others to follow. in a statement late friday, william f. lee, a lawyer for the berkshire museum, said, “we are confident that the museum has the right to go forward and that the lawsuit is factually and legally flawed.” maura healey, the massachusetts attorney general, is also named in the lawsuit as a so-called necessary party because it is her office’s job to oversee public charities like the museum. emily snyder, a spokeswoman for ms. healey, said her office “has been closely reviewing” whether there are restrictions on the museum’s ability to sell the art, and that it would also review friday’s filings. since announcing its “new vision” plan in july, the berkshire museum has been criticized by some prominent museum organizations, which believe that proceeds from the sale of artworks should be reserved for acquiring other works — not remedying budget shortfalls. in a telephone interview on friday, mr. ke

Article 6 - whose rules are these, anyway?
beyond shaping the fate of any one museum, this exchange has sparked larger questions over a principle that has long seemed sacred. why, several experts ask, is it so wrong for a museum to sell art from its collection to raise badly needed funds? and now that many institutions are facing financial hardship, should the ban on selling art to cover operating costs be eased? lending urgency to the discussion are the travails of the museum of contemporary art in los angeles, which has one of the world’s best collections of contemporary art but whose endowment is said to have shriveled to $6 million from more than $40 million over the last nine years. wouldn’t it be preferable, some people asked this month, to sell a mark rothko painting or a couple of robert rauschenberg’s legendary “combines” — the museum owns 11 — than to risk closing its doors? (ultimately the museum announced a $30 million bailout by the billionaire eli broad on tuesday that would preclude the sales of any artworks.) photo yet defenders of the prohibition warn that such sales can irreparably damage a institution. “selling an object is a knee-jerk act, and it undermines core principles of a museum,” said michael conforti, president of the directors’ association and director of the clark art institute in williamstown, mass. “there are always other options.” the sale of artwork from a museum’s permanent collection, known as deaccessioning,

Article 7 - portrait of a library testing the art world
“there was an awful lot of soul-searching,” said anne robinson, the president of the library’s board, who moved to one of those grand neighboring mansions from manhattan after 9/11. “what are our needs and what are our resources, and how do we balance them?” it’s a question that many other institutions have wrestled with — most recently and prominently brandeis university, which last month abruptly announced that it would close its art museum and sell its entire collection — and the library’s trustees consulted with several of them. the board discussed its options at its regular meetings for six months last year in the conference room beside the library’s extensive archives of local history. “what do we do with a painting that costs us $25,000 a year to insure, that we can’t display, that nobody has ever seen, that wasn’t painted by a plainfield artist, that wasn’t painted in plainfield, that isn’t a scene of plainfield, and is worth millions of dollars?” ms. robinson asked. “shouldn’t we use that for the betterment of plainfield?” photo the paintings, as well as a lithograph that is much less valuable, were owned by benjamin m. day, who had lived in north plainfield and died in 1905. his widow died in 1930, and the next year their only child, benjamin m. day jr., gave the homers to the library, where they had previously

pence springs grand hotel (before it's news) andrew pence came to this area of summers county around 1872, and in 1893 bought land from jesse beard that would be the future home of his grand hotel. the original pence springs hotel, built around 1897, made use of a nearby spring to draw in visitors all over the country. however, it wasn’t until a bottle of water from the spring won an award for best spring water at the 1904 world’s fair that business really took off. unfortunately, the original hotel burned down sometime between 1914 and 1916. however, a new, bigger hotel was built and completed around 1918. it was considered the most expensive place to stay in the state, catering to the rich who were in search of the healing waters of the springs. the money didn’t last long, though, and the great depression was enough to shut the grand hotel down. eleanor roosevelt tried to turn the property into a finishing school for young ladies, but that venture didn’t last long, either, and in 1944 the estate was finally purchased by the hugh and hall adams corporation of huntington and by 1946, the plans were drawn and finalized, turning the hotel into the west virginia state prison for women. west virginia’s female inmates were housed in the former hotel until the early 1980s. ashby berkley, the son of a

Article 1 - new body for a seaport's soul; at maritime museum's remade home, old walls talk
the new museum space, between front and south streets on fulton street, will offer salt-scented breezes and views of the harbor, and more important, walls and windows that were witnesses to the city's vibrant maritime saga. only yards from the schermerhorn buildings, with their handmade bricks and raked slate roofs, the first american ships sailed to china to open trade. whalers and packets arrived, as did boatloads of coffee, tea, molasses and, yes, immigrants. professor bender said the seaport was the place ''where immigrants got off the boat, and found employment, and even the most unskilled could get their shot.'' that influx of new americans, and the way of life of the working people of the wharves, will also be a focus of the new museum. ''we don't have the great collections of the historical societies uptown,'' mr. neill said, ''which are basically the heirlooms of the great families that no one wanted to keep. this museum is about the working people -- downtown, where the value was created. this is the beginning of the story. the uptown museums are the end of the story.'' schermerhorn row was saved after a group of spirited citizens fought for years against its demolition. they created the museum, which was chartered in 1967. the row and its block were declared landmarks in 1968 and incorporated, along with the museum, in the mall

Article 2 - the bionic brownstone
supporters say these substitute materials are stronger, cheaper and easier to maintain than original parts, and thus, paradoxically, encourage preservation. but critics worry that faux parts are often imperfect replacements for original materials, and that by allowing them, the city may be forfeiting small but significant parts of its soul. ''you end up losing the texture of a substance when you replace it with a new material,'' said simeon bankoff, the executive director of the historic districts council, a preservation group. ''and you have to ask, when does a building stop being what it was?'' it is a complicated issue, in part because it is not about something as heavy-handed as patching carnegie hall with asphalt siding. both sides want historic buildings preserved carefully and perceptively. and while the differences in their views are subtle, the stakes are high: the character and future of the built city. when the ancient romans repaired their chipped marble statues with wax, they didn't need municipal approval. new york is different, at least when it comes to noteworthy buildings. the city's landmarks preservation commission decides, case by case, what types of materials can be used on new york's 22,139 landmark properties and within its 82 historic districts. the commission, though cautious, has been fairly warm toward the new technologies and techniques. ''we're a little more progressive than the secretary of the interior,'' said brian hogg, the commission's director of preservation, referring to the

Article 3 - a rare listing on fifth avenue
correction appended take a mansion for sale on a singular block of fifth avenue, designed by a gilded age architect whose work defined an aesthetic that forever changed the landscape of the well-to-do corners of new york, throw in a $49 million price tag, and you have a blockbuster listing that is going on the market this weekend. the mansion at 973 fifth avenue, with its grand italian renaissance palazzo style and more than 15,000 square feet of living space on seven floors, was built for henry h. cook, a banker and railroad tycoon, and completed in 1907, a year before the architect, stanford white, was shot and killed by the jealous husband of a former lover. it was one of the last buildings white designed, in the swan song of beaux arts architecture, before modernism began to overtake the renaissance ideal, architectural historians say. cook at one point owned the entire block from fifth to madison avenue, between east 78th and 79th streets, and limited the building heights on fifth with deed restrictions, ensuring that nothing taller than a town house was built on the block, along a stretch of the avenue known as millionaire's row. cook himself died in 1905, before his mansion was complete, with family members inheriting it. it last sold in 1977 for $600,000, according to property records. the house is being sold by the estate of victor shafferman,

Article 4 - streetscapes/70th street between central park west and columbus avenue; a block full of late-19th-century row houses
across on the south side of the street, a house at no. 38 is the only one left of a group designed in 1888 by the architect charles clinton. an early photograph shows a picturesque row, with varying roof lines with flemish gables. next to it, at 40-58 west 70th, the architects thom & wilson designed a suave, elegant series of brick and brownstone houses, with particularly graceful carving in brownstone around the windows. a close inspection, by ascending the stoops, reveals details like inner storm doors set into angled recesses. when they are folded away, they look as if they are part of the paneling in the vestibule. several of these houses have deliciously untouched brownstone, deep and rich; they have not been misguidedly restored with the usual brown stucco. in this row two families with now-familiar names -- goldman and sachs -- once lived side by side, at nos. 44 and 46 west 70th. samuel sachs lived at no. 44 in the 1890's with his wife, louisa, two children and six servants. he had been associated since 1882 with his father-in-law, marcus goldman, in the firm of goldman, sachs. goldman lived next door at no. 46. both these houses, and many in this row, have exquisite quartered oak visible in

Article 5 - the brewer kings of staten island
even before hurricane sandy struck, the north shore of staten island called out for attention and appreciation. plans to encourage the local economy include building a 60-story ferris wheel near the st. george ferry terminal and, a short walk away in stapleton, redeveloping the old navy homeport site. but stapleton remains curiously trapped in its past, with remarkable buildings and an interesting if slightly down-at-heel commercial center. the town was named in 1836 for william j. staples, who laid out its streets and established ferry service to manhattan with his partner, a son of daniel d. tompkins, the sixth vice president of the united states. abundant local springs and a steep hillside perfect for “lagering” beer in caves attracted breweries; the largest of these was george bechtel’s, founded in 1853. photo old stables on van duzer street are all that remain of the brewery, but the grand houses on st. paul’s avenue recall the bechtel era. the meticulously maintained victorian at 387 st. paul’s avenue, built in 1888 as a wedding gift for mr. bechtel’s daughter, has not escaped notice by the “boardwalk empire” film crew. if you prefer your ladies unpainted, there are other houses nearby in a spooky, if romantic, state of dishevelment. a hike through the serpentine art and nature commons offers a clear

Article 6 - two different developers gave block its character
photo q i live at 632 west end avenue. why are there two nearly identical corner buildings flanking a row of nearly identical brownstones? ... george moran, manhattan a why, indeed? for reasons unknown, the blockfront was sold for development in two segments in 1896. william l. crow bought almost all of the frontage — enough to build eight high-stoop row houses, running from 622 to 636 west end avenue and completed in 1897. but he did not get the corners, which were acquired at the same time by the developer francis jencks. he in turn retained the architect hugh lamb to build the double town houses at each end of the block, nos. 620 and 638. mr. crow’s architect, george f. pelham, followed convention in his choices for the brownstones, even though architects like clarence true had already popularized the low-stoop house. the pelham buildings are late examples of the high-stoop type. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. jencks waited until 1899 to build on the corners, and he put up town houses with an air of edwardian london, red brick and limestone, their rooftop dormers with distinctive broken pediments. clifford hartridge, who lived in the house at the 90th street corner, was a prominent lawyer, who served on the defense of harry k. thaw in the 1906

Article 7 - in chicago, more landmarks to live in
in downtown chicago, meanwhile, the premier ""starchitect"" buildings are 860 and 880 north lake shore drive, two steel and glass apartment buildings designed by mies van der rohe over a three-year period starting in 1949. the buildings, featured in architecture history books and often referred to as among the most influential structures of the 20th century, are perennial favorites with the city's creative community. ""it's like living in a museum,"" said james kinney, president of rubloff residential properties, a large downtown real estate brokerage firm. ""people either love them or hate them. but the fact that mies designed them is a definite marketing factor."" the tradition continues today with mr. jahn's project and another by the spanish architect santiago calatrava. both projects are in streeterville, a lakefront enclave. of the two projects, mr. jahn's is closer to completion. the condo building -- a striking 41-story curvilinear tower sheathed in glass and featuring amenities like an enclosed rooftop pool -- began construction in early march and is scheduled to be completed in 2008. the building has 227 units, at prices ranging from $330,000 for an 825-square-foot one-bedroom unit, to $2.3 million for a 3,200-square-foot penthouse. buyers have signed contracts and made down payments on three-quarters of the units. ""we're selling to sophisticated people who have an interest in design,"" mr.

Article 8 - a hollywood pitch: bring the junkets back
the success of the junket business in beverly hills, mr. collins added, is “largely a default position, because there are no five-star hotels in hollywood.” the new hotel will “fill a vacuum in hollywood in a big way,” said leslie lambert, a regional administrator for the los angeles community redevelopment agency, which is overseeing the revitalization of the historic hollywood district. developer interest in hollywood appears high, to judge from more than a dozen current proposals, including a 1.3-million-square-foot millennium hollywood residential, office and retail project. directly across the street from the w hotel is the proposed boulevard 6200, with 1,042 rental units. designing a hotel that can accommodate junkets is not a casual undertaking, according to edward abeyta, principal of hks inc., an architecture firm based in dallas that is responsible for the hotel-and-condominium complex. junkets are highly structured events and require a specific configuration of hospitality rooms and reception rooms, according to the architect. some hotel rooms need at least three bathrooms, with two of them large enough for a hair stylist or makeup artist to work in. photo those same rooms need to be capable of being emptied of furniture at a moment’s notice so they can be transformed into “taping suites,” where actors can chat on camera with a succession of reporters and camera operators, who wait their turns in the adjoining hallway. in a single

Title: streetscapes/19 gramercy park south; an 1880's house that asks, 'what's in a name?'
Content: up a sensuously modeled staircase, the second floor has a white-painted central room, with columns and unusual classical detailing -- early and elaborate for 1887, when american architecture was still in the thrall of the richardsonian romanesque. in 1979, mr. gill wrote in the new yorker that the fish house was designed by white, reflecting a strong oral tradition that the famed partner in mckim, mead & white was in charge. white's house -- no longer standing -- was just across gramercy park, at lexington avenue. the fishes' later house at 78th street and madison avenue was definitely designed by white. and mckim, mead & white did render a bill to the fishes for work on the gramercy park south house. but the internal records were marked, ''check to stratton.'' (most of the firm's surviving records are at the new-york historical society.) indeed, both the alteration permit at the department of buildings and the real estate record & guide, a trade journal, list the architect as sidney v. stratton, not mckim, mead & white. stratton is now a little-known designer, but he was one of the first american students at the ecole des beaux-arts in paris, along with h. h. richardson and richard morris hunt. after the ecole, stratton worked for hunt and went out on his own in the 1870's; he designed the queen anne style house & school of industry at 120 west 16th street, several country houses and the green alcove, a gemlike portion of an older room now at the new york society library at 53 east 79th street. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. mosette broderick, a lecturer in the urban design program at n.y.u. who has studied the work of both stratton and mckim, mead & white extensively, says that stratton met charles mckim at the ecole, sublet space from the firm in 1877 and developed an unusual arrangement from the early 1880's to about 1889. stratton was listed on the firm's letterhead, but underneath the partners' names, and separated from them by a line. mrs. broderick says that in the early 1880's, stratton was much better connected to new york society than were charles mckim, william mead or white -- that they used stratton to gain access to that world

These statements are not supported by factual information and seem to be intended for entertainment or ridicule rather than serious reporting. The article also contains numerous contradictions with established facts about government shutdowns, tax policies, and economic issues in the US.","Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

The US Senate was addressed by Sen. Marco Rubio in response to President Obama's State of the Union address, highlighting America's exceptionalism and the importance of individual freedom.

Meanwhile, food stamp recipients exceeded 45 million for four years, with over 47 million people receiving benefits as of December 2012. This has raised concerns about the nation's economic health.

In a surprising move, Alice from Wonderland held her first press conference, calling the US an ""asylum"" and criticizing the current political state. She also expressed frustration with the Republican Party, labeling it the ""stupidest party ever.""

The Daily Bell published an article claiming that government shutdowns pose a risk to public health and economic stability, citing CNN reports on potential outbreaks of disease and economic meltdowns.

Larwyn's Linx featured an article about Rep. Alan Grayson, who has been described as a national embarrassment due to his comments on spending and the economy.

The article ""Renewed Government Attack on Private Property – Why Fear This?"" highlighted the government's increasing control over land in America, with 1 out of every 3 acres controlled by the federal government.

These articles highlight concerns about individual freedom, economic health, and government control, as well as the potential risks posed by government shutdowns and the nation's reliance on food stamps.","The US budget is facing a debt battle, with veterans warning that discretionary spending cannot continue to bear the brunt without significant implications for government services. The deficit-reduction compromise last year left unscathed entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

A report from the President's bipartisan deficit commission was released, but its recommendations are unclear whether the administration and Congress will embrace them. Wall Street analysts cite uncertainty on environmental regulations as another source of damaging uncertainty.

The tax wilderness is complex, with changes made last year affecting single people with high incomes and couples earning above certain thresholds. The Affordable Care Act introduced new taxes, including a 0.9% Medicare contribution tax on wages and self-employment income.

Senator Bernie Sanders criticized President Trump's infrastructure plan, labeling it ""corporate welfare."" He proposed a $1 trillion investment over five years to rebuild America's infrastructure.

Treasury Secretary Paulson emphasized global issues, citing the economy's slowdown, rising inflation, and gasoline prices. The administration plans to announce a lower-than-projected budget deficit due to climbing tax revenues.

Actor Arshad Warsi was trolled on Twitter for targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

The Trump administration is moving forward with a tax overhaul plan, which will be unveiled this month. However, most analyses suggest the plan disproportionately benefits the rich, leaving many tax experts scratching their heads.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

(before it's news) one of the things that perpetually frightens me about america is the unreasoning ability of our people to continually wave off things that are right in our faces – to just believe in the better side of people – even politicians. “they wouldn’t do that to us – it’ll never last” or “that’ll never pass”. right. remember health care? one of the newest versions of this is the cap and trade bill which is supposedly scrapped, though senate leader reid stated that postponing the bill didn’t preclude him from bringing it back. trying to talk to farmers every day about this sledgehammer heading for their heads is frustrating because they believe the mainstream media when they quote the first half of reid’s statement about postponing the bill, but not the second part of his statement about bringing it back. sound familiar? it should. how many times were we told about the death knell of health care? now we have this spectacular initiative of the government to continue to expand their control over land in america. this is to “protect the special places”. one thing i didn’t know until i saw an article by michelle malkin on cns news where she hit me in the head with an astonishing fact: the government controls 1 out of every 3 acres in this country. why is this

Article 1 - as a debt battle looms, budget veterans see no option but to raise taxes
the two budget deals last year — the deficit-reduction compromise in august and a smaller agreement before that — called for cutting $1.7 trillion from so-called discretionary spending, which covers the bulk of federal programs whose budgets congress controls annually, including air-traffic control, the military, education, research and much more. those deals left unscathed the entitlement programs like medicare, medicaid and social security, which, given the growing aging population, are driving projections of unsustainable deficits. and those deals, because of republicans’ resistance, did not raise taxes, unlike the deficit measures of the 1980s and 1990s. “tax hikes destroy jobs,” mr. boehner said in his speech on tuesday. but veterans of past budget wars say that discretionary spending for domestic programs, which make up just 15 percent of the federal budget, cannot continue to bear the brunt without significant implications for government services. “they’ve gone way past fat and are cutting into muscle,” said bruce r. bartlett, who was a treasury official in the reagan administration. nor, these people say, would the public support the deeper reductions that would have to be made in programs like medicare if taxes are not part of the mix. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and

Article 2 - it’s the big questions that slow growth
simply promising not to raise taxes wouldn’t be helpful. the american people are wise enough to understand that wishing won’t make the problem go away. the only way to resolve this fundamental uncertainty is to enact a credible long-run deficit reduction plan that shows what spending will be cut and what taxes will be raised, once the economy returns to full employment. the release of the report of the president’s bipartisan deficit commission on wednesday was an important step, but it is unclear whether the administration and congress will embrace the recommendations. wall street analysts often cite possible government regulations on the environment as another source of damaging uncertainty. but as with the deficit, inaction could be far more damaging than action. climate change and dependence on foreign oil are problems that won’t go away on their own. tabling plans to deal with them doesn’t make it easier for companies to plan and invest; it makes it harder. photo until businesses and communities know the costs and incentives for developing renewable energy, nuclear power and natural gas — and whether we will address climate change through prices or direct regulation — it will be very hard to invest in new power sources and related industrial technologies. the deepest and most destructive uncertainty we face centers on the overall health of the economy and its prospects for growth. unlike other postwar recessions that were caused by tight monetary policy and high interest rates, the recent downturn resulted from the bursting of a housing bubble and a financial crisis. because we are in largely uncharted territory, figuring out how and when

Article 3 - the tax wilderness, untamed
but the changes last year were not entirely straightforward — and certainly weren’t part of a comprehensive overhaul. they did not merely raise taxes for higher-income people; they also made filing more complex. single people with at least $250,000 in adjusted gross income — the threshold for married couples is $300,000 — were hit by new curbs on personal exemptions and on many popular deductions, such as those for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions. on top of those changes came the tax increases of the affordable care act, billed as a way to pay for president obama’s health care law by tapping the pockets of the well-to-do. individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 saw an additional medicare contribution tax of 0.9 percent on wages and self-employment income. and an additional tax of 3.8 percent on investment income — interest, dividends, royalties, annuities, capital gains, rents and income from passive business activities — will be calculated on whatever is less, net investment income or gross income above the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold. there were other changes, too. a total of 55 tax breaks expired — at least for now — including one that allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in out-of-pocket costs for school supplies. a deduction for tuition and fees vanished, as did credits for installation of some energy-efficient home improvements. of course, congress could reinstate

Article 4 - bernie sanders rails against donald trump’s infrastructure ‘scam’ | the huffington post
bernie sanders rails against donald trump’s infrastructure ‘scam’ “trump’s plan is corporate welfare coming and going.” 11/22/2016 04:54 am et rebecca shapiro senior editor, the huffington post sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) called out president-elect donald trump ’s plan on infrastructure, labeling it a “scam” and “corporate welfare.” in an article posted to medium on monday , the senator said trump rightfully promised to improve america’s infrastructure while on the campaign trail, but the president-elect’s plan has fallen short on that promise. “trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes. and then he would allow the companies to ‘invest’ in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks,” sanders wrote. “trump’s plan is corporate welfare coming and going.” sanders added that he planned to reintroduce in january his policy calling for a $1 trillion investment over five years to rebuild america’s roads, bridges, water systems, railways, airports, levees and dams, which he unveiled last year. “unlike trump’s plan, which creates new tax loopholes and is a corporate giveaway, my rebuild america act would be paid for by eliminating tax loopholes that allow hugely profitable multinational corporations to stash their profits in offshore tax havens around the world,” he wrote. trump has cited

Article 5 - paulson, taking treasury post, emphasizes global issues
administration officials are frustrated that mr. bush’s popular support has plunged, mainly because of the war in iraq, even as the economy has grown briskly and unemployment has remained comparatively low at 4.6 percent. on tuesday, the administration plans to announce that this year’s budget deficit will be lower than projected because tax revenues are climbing faster than expected. last friday, mr. bush visited a microelectronics factory near chicago to highlight the nation’s high-technology strength and the newest employment statistics. but mr. paulson will be taking over at a time when the economy appears to be slowing, inflation is rising and gasoline prices have climbed to nearly $3.20 a gallon in many regions. the federal reserve has raised interest rates 17 times in two years and is expected to increase them at least once more. the once-sizzling housing market has slowed noticeably, with prices edging down in some cities and homes remaining on the market much longer than in the recent past. although mr. bush’s economic policy, with its emphasis on tax cuts, deregulation and trade, has a distinct ideological cast, mr. paulson will be leading a new economic team that has an early reputation as more pragmatic than ideological. mr. bush’s chief of staff, joshua b. bolten, is a former goldman executive who is trying to improve ties between the white house and congress. rob portman, who recently took over as director of the office of management and budget, served as

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US budget is facing a debt battle, with veterans warning that discretionary spending cannot continue to bear the brunt without significant implications for government services. The deficit-reduction compromise last year left unscathed entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

A report from the President's bipartisan deficit commission was released, but its recommendations are unclear whether the administration and Congress will embrace them. Wall Street analysts cite uncertainty on environmental regulations as another source of damaging uncertainty.

The tax wilderness is complex, with changes made last year affecting single people with high incomes and couples earning above certain thresholds. The Affordable Care Act introduced new taxes, including a 0.9% Medicare contribution tax on wages and self-employment income.

Senator Bernie Sanders criticized President Trump's infrastructure plan, labeling it ""corporate welfare."" He proposed a $1 trillion investment over five years to rebuild America's infrastructure.

Treasury Secretary Paulson emphasized global issues, citing the economy's slowdown, rising inflation, and gasoline prices. The administration plans to announce a lower-than-projected budget deficit due to climbing tax revenues.

Actor Arshad Warsi was trolled on Twitter for targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

The Trump administration is moving forward with a tax overhaul plan, which will be unveiled this month. However, most analyses suggest the plan disproportionately benefits the rich, leaving many tax experts scratching their heads.

photo volgograd, russia — in less than two months, i hope to be competing in the pole vault at the olympic games in rio. this would be my fifth and final olympics — a unique accomplishment for a woman, one that seemed just a faint dream when i started my career almost two decades ago. but this dream may not be fulfilled. i and my fellow track and field athletes from russia were suspended by the international association of athletics federations (i.a.a.f.) from international competition, including possibly the olympics, after the world anti-doping agency confirmed allegations of state-sponsored doping by russian athletes. on friday, the i.a.a.f. will be voting on whether to lift that suspension. if they uphold it, those of us who have never used banned substances will be punished for the behavior of others. i wholeheartedly support the battle against cheats who willingly choose to breach the antidoping rules, violate the spirit of athletic competition and leave a stain on the reputation of their countries and their fellow athletes. they must be held accountable; after all, it is because of the reprehensible actions of such people that i am in this predicament, fighting for my right to compete. i understand that the i.a.a.f. needs to take strong action to eradicate doping. but i do not think it is fair to forbid me and other clean russian athletes to compete — athletes who have repeatedly proved they are innocent of cheating. advertisement continue reading the main

gailhaguet did not specify who had pressured le gougne. he added that ''contrary to the accusations, there was no collusion with the east european nations.'' skating officials said earlier today that it was not likely that the decision would be overturned, although a canadian olympic official raised the possibility of awarding a second set of gold medals if judging improprieties were found. ottavio cinquanta, the president of the international skating union, said today that the head referee, ronald pfenning of the united states, was among the people who had contacted him questioning the voting that left salé and pelletier with a silver despite what appeared to be a cleaner and more elegant long program than that of the russians, berezhnaya and sikharulidze. cinquanta did not disclose the details of pfenning's written report, but said, ''at the moment, i have an allegation and i have a denial.'' he did not identify who was accused or who had made the denial. one member of a western national olympic committee and a high-ranking western figure skating official who spoke to pfenning said today that he was prompted to file the report after he was told about conversations regarding possible collusion on the nine-judge panel. jacques rogge, the president of the international olympic committee, met with cinquanta today to emphasize that the situation needed to be resolved quickly. ''they must work day and night

Article 3 - putin says doping sanctions devalue rio olympic medals
the international olympic committee was urged by athletes and antidoping officials to bar the entire russian team after an investigation confirmed a pervasive state-sponsored doping scheme. but olympics officials instead chose to defer that decision to individual sports federations. mr. putin promised that russia would treat the barred athletes as olympic champions, “with all the administrative and financial consequences this entails.” photo in january, the russian government ruled that gold medalists in rio de janeiro would receive 4 million rubles each, or $60,000. yelena isinbayeva, a pole-vaulter who is among the track and field athletes barred from the games, could not hide her tears in her speech that followed mr. putin’s. “they took from us the goal that had kept us going and motivated us to keep pushing our own limits every day,” said mrs. isinbayeva, two-time olympic champion and the current world-record holder in pole vault. “today we faced such lawlessness, injustice and complacency from certain people in the sports world, who do whatever they want under the rules that they created themselves.” following the meeting, russian athletes went to one of the kremlin’s ancient cathedrals, where patriarch kirill i, the head of the russian orthodox church, conducted a farewell service. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the sports newsletter get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from times journalists

Article 4 - turbine potsdam still powers women’s soccer
hundreds of fans gathered tuesday night at the team’s 40th-anniversary party on the shore of templiner lake outside potsdam. there they watched germany defeat france, 4-2, in the world cup, with the first goal coming off an assist by turbine’s own babett peter. they listened to the power ballads of the pop singer ute freudenberg, who defected to west germany in 1984 but is now back in the former east. the biggest cheers of the night, however, were for the 68-year-old coach and athletic director, bernd schröder, who read that note back in 1971 and volunteered to coach the team. he has been with turbine ever since, with the exception of a one-year suspension by communist officials for letting his squad play teams from the west. photo “it’s unique in world history and cannot be repeated,” schröder said tuesday, a week after receiving the federal cross of merit, the highest civilian award in germany. “you don’t get a penny for it,” he said about the medal. “i won the activist of socialist labor six times and got 250 marks for each one.” the joke is that schröder has worked these past 40 years without taking a salary from the team. he earned his living until retirement as an engineer at the plant. a tall, charismatic coach with a deep voice, schröder is the symbol of the

Article 5 - fifa confirms winter world cup for 2022
fifa confirmed that the 2022 world cup in qatar would be played in the winter, announcing thursday that its governing executive committee had set the date of that year’s final for dec. 18. the move away from the summer months to winter had been expected for years. almost immediately after awarding the world cup to qatar in 2010, top fifa officials, including the president, sepp blatter, acknowledged that playing the event in the searing heat of the gulf summer was unworkable, and unwise. while the final is now set, it remains unclear when the tournament will begin. the 2014 tournament in brazil lasted 32 days, and the 2018 world cup in russia is scheduled at the same length. a similar timetable in qatar would put the world cup opener around nov. 17, though fifa officials suggested thursday that a 28- or 29-day schedule was under consideration. few in soccer disputed the need for a move away from the summer once fifa declared that there was no chance qatar would lose the right to host. the problem was finding an open window on the calendar. advertisement continue reading the main story any move out of the summer would upset fifa’s richest stakeholders, most notably the european leagues and federations that would see their lucrative league and cup seasons interrupted and the united states media companies like fox, which will have to broadcast the tournament during the heart of the american football season

Article 6 - a skier’s singular pursuit
aside from the peruvian ski association’s helping him with the paperwork necessary to participate in the olympics, carcelen is on his own. he works full time to chase his olympic ambitions, consulting with microsoft and operating a business called inca runners, which offers guided running tours of the inca trail to machu picchu. he also looks after his 16-month-old daughter and hopes to find a coach who is willing to work with him for the next year. “you have to prioritize, and this is important to me,” carcelen said. “i am consulting with microsoft and running the guiding business in peru, which gives me a very flexible schedule and allows me to train about three hours a day. my wife is very supportive. without her, it would not be possible. she’ll drive behind me for three hours while i roller-ski.” carcelen, who met his wife online and moved to seattle to marry her in 2003, started skiing in 2005 when kate, 37, introduced him to the sport and coached him through his first seasons. kate carcelen is a skilled skier with a seemingly endless patience for her husband’s effort. she works full time as a manager at microsoft. as the only participant from a developing country, roberto carcelen is already guaranteed an entry in the 15-kilometer race. he also hopes to enter the pursuit race and the sprint, but those events have

Article 7 - american wins women’s luge, upsetting german dynasty
her two-run time of 1 minute 28.098 seconds was 0.187 of a second faster than natalie geisenberger of germany. natalia yakushenko of ukraine finished third. “it was a little bit of a shock for us, but one day the day comes that we lose,” geisenberger said. “the day is today.” some hamlin supporters climbed off of the viewing platform and onto the track, luge’s equivalent of storming the court. her mother leaned over the railing for a tight hug. beyond the immediate family, hamlin was cheered by a grandmother who had never seen her race. an aunt, who owns a charter-bus company, brought about 100 friends and family members from remsen, a small town north of utica. a few feet away from the celebration, ron rossi, the chief executive of usa luge, tried to put the surprising result in perspective. “this is monumental,” he said, sliding into a comparison to the 1980 united states olympic hockey team. “there was a miracle at lake placid 29 years ago, and when you think about a 100-race winning streak, and the type of performance that the germans have had over the years, this is up there. it’s just not something that people will notice as much, but it’s just as significant.” the day opened with a promising harbinger for the home team. mark grim

Article 8 - french need no help to take an early lead
under normal circumstances, the performance of the ice dancers marina anissina and gwendal peizerat of france this evening would have raised few eyebrows. the skaters, among the favorites to win the gold medal, were in sync, technically sound and worthy of their first-place finish after the two compulsory dances. but ice dancing -- and the french couple -- are smack in the middle of the figure skating controversy that has engulfed these olympics. the french judge marie reine le gougne was suspended today for misconduct, after allegations that she scored the russian pairs team of yelena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze higher than the canadians jamie salé and david pelletier on monday night so that anissina and peizerat would be favored in ice dancing. tonight in the quick step and blues programs in front of a crowd of 14,990 at the salt lake ice center, the french team certainly did not need any kind of help. anissina and peizerat, who won the bronze medal at the 1998 nagano games, received mostly 5.6's and 5.7's for technique in the quick step and mostly 5.7's and 5.8's in the blues. their scores for timing and expression were all 5.8's and 5.9's. ''we really don't think about it, care about it,'' peizerat said about the

Title: east german sports machine shadows vancouver olympics
Content: “it’s never too late for an admission,” said thomas bach, the president of the german olympic committee and an i.o.c. delegate. “we appreciate this.” few athletes who became stars in east germany are still competing two decades later. unless they were 18 or older when the wall fell, they can no longer be investigated for possible association with the stasi, which penetrated every aspect of life in the authoritarian nation, a spokesman for the german olympic committee said. a more wary approach is taken with head coaches, doctors and other high officials named to german teams for the winter and summer games. they are vetted by a special sports commission to determine whether their secret police files contain implications of official involvement or harm done to others by their actions. photo “regarding athletes, this should be over by now,” said walter tröger, a former president of the german olympic committee. “for the other persons, it will not be. we have to deal with this until it comes to an end, as long as these people live.” competing for a unified germany, steuer, now 43, won a bronze medal in pairs skating at the 1998 winter games in nagano, japan. it was later discovered that as a teenager, he signed a contract with the stasi, wrote 84 reports about others from 1985 to 1989 under the alias torsten and was paid 4,000 east german marks, or about $2,800 today, german officials said. according to news accounts, he was accused of informing on a skater who considered defecting to france and of spying on the two-time olympic champion katarina witt. before and after the 2006 winter games in turin, italy, german olympic and skating officials tried to bar steuer as a coach. he seemed defiant, unapologetic, olympic officials said. but each time, he prevailed in court. three years ago, steuer finally acknowledged and apologized for his collaboration with the stasi. for the vancouver games, he was welcomed into the german team. he will coach aliona savchenko and robin szolkowy in the pairs competition beginning sunday. advertisement continue reading the main story “his attitude has changed,” bach said. “a lot of time has passed.” in an e-mail response to questions, steuer said that only in recent years had he understood how the stasi had manipulated him. he said the government began observing him after he won the world junior pairs championship. as a teenager, steuer said, he later developed a trusting relationship with his minder, who seemed to understand and help solve many of his problems. photo “i dropped all hesitation and always opened my heart to him,” steuer said. “it did not occur to me that i had done something wrong. unfortunately, i only noticed far too late.” witt said that steuer

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Several articles discuss the ongoing issues in international sports, particularly in figure skating and track and field. 

In figure skating, a French judge, Marie Reine Le Gougne, was suspended for misconduct after allegations of scoring Russian pairs team higher than Canadian pair to favor French skaters. The incident has sparked controversy over judging irregularities.

Meanwhile, Russian athletes were suspended from international competition due to state-sponsored doping. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) is set to vote on whether to lift the suspension, which would affect Russian track and field athletes like pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva.

In another development, FIFA confirmed that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be played in the winter, with the final scheduled for December 18. The move away from the summer months was expected due to concerns over heat and player safety.

Additionally, a Peruvian skier, Roberto Carcelen, is set to compete in the Olympics despite facing challenges in balancing his training schedule with work and family responsibilities.

why is it that there are eight days of hanukkah and only one really traditional holiday food, at least in this country? sure, i’ve read all about what other cultures eat in “the book of jewish food” by claudia roden. the israelis savor doughnuts, the hungarians, cheese pancakes. the sephardim nosh syrup-soaked fritters and the italians deep-fried chicken. but here in the states, it’s the latke that most jews will fry this weekend, letting the grated-potato cakes turn golden and crisp before slathering them with sour cream or applesauce or both. being a documented latke lover, i’ll do my own time with the vegetable grater at least twice during hanukkah. but that leaves me wondering what to make on the other six days. advertisement continue reading the main story as long as it’s fried in olive oil to commemorate the miracle of 165 b.c.

jonathan taube, a personal chef who leads what he calls “interactive dinner parties” through his white plains business, rocky rill foods, thinks he knows why. “so many people are watching cooking shows on tv now that cooking has become a spectator sport. but what’s happening on tv doesn’t always translate into cooking at home,” he said. “this is a fun way to get people together to learn something, and then you all sit down and have a great meal. it’s easy, elegant entertaining.” like ms. fragala-harper and her team, mr. taube consults with hosts weeks before a party, during which the kitchen’s amenities are sized up and a custom menu is drafted. for example, “liza and erica wanted the picky-eaters class because they’re all busy moms who need to be able to get something healthy on the table that their kids are actually going to eat,” ms. fragala-harper said. they settled on a menu that included mini turkey burgers and potato-crusted fish. mr. taube, of white plains, said that the interests of hosts vary widely. some are eager to explore basic knife skills, others want to master pressure cookers and some want to become proficient with asian ingredients. “some people say, ‘just give me a menu for a three-course meal i could do any weeknight,’ ” he said. mr. taube, ms. fragala-harper and jennifer ur

Article 3 - reaching across the ages for breads to warm the soul
in the realm of culinary activities, baking is the most personal. we might cook out of duty but when we bake, we bake out of love. and for most of us, that love needs a mentor. fortunately, there is maggie glezer. ms. glezer knows that baking recipes are best understood within the context and traditions they call home. she also knows that baking is a science, requiring precision and skill, awareness and understanding. many forms of cookery have adjustment valves and reset buttons; baking does not. ms. glezer's first book, ''artisan baking in america'' (artisan), brought a regimen of small-scale professional recipes and techniques -- the magic of cool fermentation, low doses of yeast and the principle of autolyse (a brief early rest to make yeasted doughs compliant) -- into home kitchens. she offered a crash course in tactile education and gave home bakers a feel for soft, sticky doughs and a taste for bread with a big, open crumb and shattering crust. these weren't just favorite recipes: they were a collection that reflected the range and rewards of an american movement toward bread baking as an artisan craft. in her new book, a blessing of bread (artisan, $35), ms. glezer reaches across the jewish diaspora to bring us bread recipes and traditions from eastern europe, the mediterranean, north africa and the near east. to compile this book, ms. glezer interviewed and worked alongside dozens of jewish b

Article 4 - fads aside, the perfect macaron is timeless
with the french economy spiraling downward, with pessimism infecting france like black mold, la patisserie (the pastry) has risen in importance. “is la pâtisserie going to replace sex?” screamed the headline of an article in the magazine marianne this spring. but the article was not about macarons. in paris, hardly anyone talks about macarons. the battle for the palates of the french seems to be elsewhere. madame figaro magazine announced recently that “the cream-filled puff pastry has replaced the macaron.” and the styles supplement of the weekly magazine l’express declared the éclair the winner, having “rendered the macaron old-fashioned.” of course none of this matters to mr. génot, the baker of the classic macaron, which i sampled from the parchment paper on a tray still warm from the oven. it was crisp on the outside and moist and soft in the middle, with just enough chew. it took me back to buffalo, to the pignoli, a sicilian version of macarons studded with pine nuts that my aunt lili made in huge batches at christmas. like mr. génot, she kept her recipe secret, not by withholding it, but by slightly altering proportions of the ingredients in every retelling. “ours are the originals, the macarons of the french revolution,” said mr. génot, who runs maison des soeurs macarons (house of the macarons

Article 5 - dorie greenspan talks about a world of nothing but cookies
dorie greenspan talks about a world of nothing but cookies dorie greenspan chef dorie greenspan (davide luciano) margy rochlin what must it have been like to be dorie greenspan’s neighbor in paris’ leafy 6 th arrondissement while she worked on her latest cookbook, “dorie’s cookies”? for months and months, the scent-clouds of butter, sugar, flour, eggs and vanilla floated out her window as greenspan, a veteran baker and author of multi james beard award-winning cookbooks — “baking with julia,”“baking chez moi,”“around my french table”— challenged herself to compile an all-star collection of 170 cookies, both sweet and savory. colorful, packed with tips and clocking in at 517 pages, “ dorie’s cookies ” seems also to have become greenspan’s way of democratizing the warm act of cookie baking. greenspan, who swears by high-fat cultured butter but tests her recipes with unsalted land o’lakes, says cheerily, “i’d much rather have people use whatever ingredients they have in their house than not bake.” after writing 12 cookbooks, what made you think, “my next one will be just about cookies”? i hit a bump — a mountain, not a bump — when i was writing “around my french table.” i couldn’t see my way to the end of the project. i called my editor and said,

Article 6 - the english lose their cool
this passionate turn by britain — actually, england and wales; if northern ireland and scotland could, they’d stay put — is not particularly surprising. the passion is not only about europe, and it’s not entirely new. the warming of the english sang-froid has been going on for some time. photo i first noticed a growing propensity for the english to overindulge their feelings in the wake of the death of diana, princess of wales, in 1997. the composure of the funeral guests was in stark contrast to the behavior of the crowd outside westminster abbey: emotional, bereft, even distraught. there were not only tears, there was hugging. london was not london that day, it was rome or naples; it wore its heart on its sleeve, like new york. it was an unrecognizable city, its nerves frayed, sharing its grief. it was the first proof, to my eyes, that the english were losing their imperturbability. the funeral was an inflection point, but it wasn’t a beginning. it merely highlighted changes that had been underway for decades. when i first encountered england as a student, it seemed that, aside from the few who took part in the swinging ’60s and ’70s, the english didn’t know how to have fun. but that soon began to change. they ventured abroad on vacation. long before the global public took notice, english

Article 7 - the chef alex atala reveals surprises in store for danish food conference mad4
how has the role of chef changed in the culture? we have never had the voice we have now, and we are learning how to use that for good. many of us have worked in kitchens our whole lives with the goal of becoming head chef without having the time to expand our education. everyone who is going to mad knows how to cook, but we invite people from other disciplines who might help us understand an aspect of what we do in a different way. mad is an opportunity for chefs to push out the boundaries of the kitchen and explore new ways to be a chef. have any ideas explored at mad had a real application in the world? sure. as an example, we have the first mad, when i introduced the subject of eating insects. it was something quite new at the time, especially in the fine dining world. since then the idea has been well accepted and insects are much more commonplace. they have even been categorized as food by the united nation’s food and agriculture organization. there is an international festival circuit that often features many of the same faces. has there been an effort to diversify that this year? we are going to surprise people with new names, even if they are shining stars in their own world but maybe are unknown in the culinary world. producers, artists, scientists, people who work in social justice. we are also looking at some young chefs who might be a surprise and important in the future. many conferences can be focused only on the existing big names, and that

Article 8 - perfection? hint: it’s warm and has a secret
the first visit was to the city bakery, on west 18th street, owned by maury rubin, who seems to get as much pleasure from talking about food as from eating it. when asked about the secret to his cookies, he said, “we bake them in small batches every hour so they’re always fresh.” he went on to say that the store sells more than 1,000 cookies a day. why, then, does almost everybody say they prefer homemade to bakery bought? mr. rubin smiled, having already figured out the answer. “it’s the warm rule,” he said. “even a bad cookie straight from the oven has its appeal.” it’s an opinion expressed by every baker visited. jacques torres , who has three branches of his jacques torres chocolate in manhattan and brooklyn, has a small warming tray set up near the register so customers can get their cookies soft and gooey, although he offers them at room temperature, too. seth berkowitz, the owner of insomnia cookies on east eighth street, goes so far as to have a display case filled with baskets spilling over with stand-in cookies; the real deals are sold straight from a holding oven. heather sue mercer, one of three sisters who own ruby et violette, which recently reopened on west 50th street, believes that her bakery’s basic chocolate chip cookie “is definitely better warm,” but, she said, “i think some of our

Title: a growing challenge for germans who live by bread alone
Content: the shift in culture is so worrying to bakers like mr. trefzger that they are taking extraordinary steps to raise the awareness of germans, and the world, to the uniqueness of their threatened baking traditions. they are reaching out to young people via social media in an effort to attract more of them to the job. last year, the german bakers’ association even applied for the country’s baking tradition to receive special recognition and protection by adding it to the unesco list of cultural heritages, where it would gain a spot alongside french cuisine and croatian gingerbread. so far, however, none of those steps has reversed the seemingly inexorable decline of the german bakery. last year, the number of german bakeries dropped 3.6 percent. only 13,171 now remain in a country of about 80 million people that six decades ago counted more than 55,000 bakeries in the former west germany alone. in the past seven years, the number of young people training to become bakers has dropped by a third, to 26,535 in 2013. that is a long fall for german culinary tradition, more commonly associated with sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes. yet from the days of charlemagne until the end of the previous century, a staple of the german diet was thick, hearty slices of sourdough-leavened bread made from grains like rye or spelt. the german word for supper, “abendbrot,” means “evening bread.” “until the 1960s, bread served as the central source of nourishment in germany,” said peter becker, president of the german bakers’ association. “people would even make a cross on the bread as a sign of thankfulness. that significance has been lost.” like many traditional bakers, mr. trefzger came to his profession through his father, who instilled in his son the passion for his craft. but, mr. trefzger said, many parents no longer want to see their children enter a profession with such grueling hours — craft bakers usually begin mixing dough for the next day’s bread just after midnight — often discouraging even those who show an interest in baking. sweden 150 miles denmark north sea poland hamburg berlin neth. germany belg. czech rep. france schopfheim austria switz. then there is the convenience of modern, mass-scale food production, which has enticed germans as it has people in other industrialized countries. it can be hard to compete with. siegfried brenneis, 48, a certified baker and pastry chef from the village of mudau and a member of an elite group of german bakers who take part in international competitions, said supermarket bakeries had allowed discounters to attract customers through what he called “aroma marketing,” the pretense of handcrafted breads and

Article 1 - the christmas truce of 1914 – pinhole of light among a nightmare of madness
(before it's news) (tony cartalucci – ld) in the end, we have more in common with the furthest flung foreign common man than the closest corporate-fascist that presumes dominion over our lives. during the early 1900′s, europe was locked in the first world war. millions would perish – tens of thousands in a single day. on one brief occasion, a pinhole of light shined through this utter madness, revealing the truth of this man-made nightmare. the men in the trenches were being driven toward each other, not by some irreconcilable difference they had with one another, but by the greed of those ruling elite residing in their respective homelands. if only the british and germans realized it was the greed of their own banking houses and industrialists that had them in the trenches and not some irreconcilable difference amongst themselves… knowledge is power, ignorance literally can mean death. when will we start being leaders in our homes, communities, counties, and provinces – driving our own destiny rather than being driven? shall we look upon the christmas truce of 1914 with wonder a century on, or look toward it as evidence something was and still is tragically wrong with human civilization and work this next year with renewed vigor to resolve it?

Article 2 - how the u.s. dollar will be replaced
how the u.s. dollar will be replaced (before it's news) this article has been contributed by brandon smith of alt market. after being immersed in the world of alternative economic analysis for several years, it sometimes becomes easy to forget that most people do not track forex markets, or debt to gdp ratio, or true unemployment, or hunch over imf white-papers highlighting subsections which expose the trappings of the globalist ideology. sometimes, you just assume the average person knows what the heck you are talking about. this is, of course, a mistake. however, it is a mistake that is borne from the inadequacy of our age and our culture, and is not necessarily a product of weak character, either of the analyst, or the casual reader. the great frustration of being actively involved in the liberty movement is the fact that many people are rarely on the same page (or even the same book) during political and economic discussion. where we see the nature of the false left/right paradigm, they see “free democracy”. where we see a tidal wave of destructive debt, they see a “responsible government” printing and spending in order to protect our “best interests”. where we see totalitarianism, they see “safety”. where we see dollar devaluation, they see dollar strength and longevity. ultimately, because the average unaware citizen is stricken by the disease of normalcy bias and living within the doldrums of a statistical fantasy world, they

smedley darlington butler born: west chester, pa., july 30, 1881 educated: haverford school married: ethel c. peters, of philadelphia, june 30, 1905 awarded two congressional medals of honor: capture of vera cruz, mexico, 1914 capture of ft. riviere, haiti, 1917 distinguished service medal, 1919 major general – united states marine corps retired oct. 1, 1931 on leave of absence to act as director of dept. of safety, philadelphia, 1932 director of dept. of safety, philadelphia, 1932 lecturer — 1930’s republican candidate for senate, 1932 died at naval hospital, philadelphia, june 21, 1940 for more information about major general butler, contact the united states marine corps. chapter one war is a racket war is a racket. it always has been. it is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. it is the only one international in scope. it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. a racket is best described, i believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. only a small “inside” group knows what it is about. it is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many.

Article 4 - we are teetering on the very brink
we are teetering on the very brink (before it's news) … and all the boy osborne seems able to think of is using the libor outrage to score petty student-politics points against balls. grow up, you infantile git, and look around you at what is about to befall. we have written here before of the significance of defending the uk’s aaa . now we see a challenge of even greater magnitude: powerful forces full of revanchist malevolence see their opportunity to destroy the city utterly and forever. the french, the germans, the multifarious ex-communist euro-federasts seated in brussels, yes and even the americans with their atavistic anti-colonial instincts, they all want the pre-eminence of london ended for good. the chinese will be only too pleased to pick up some of the pieces for themselves. code napoleon. addicted to their own centralising bureaucratic ways, none of these envious nations have ever truly succeeded in emulating (or even understanding) the deep otc markets fostered here. instead, heavy-handedly they always fall back to corralling commerce into exchange-trading uniformity, thereby crushing the financial creativity and innovation which are the hallmarks of flourishing capitalism, and vehicles of economic advance. by contrast, the city together with our precious common law legal system sustains not just the deepest and most liquid markets in financial and physical traded products, but the vast industry of legal and other professional

Article 5 - another war in europe? in whose name?
another war in europe? in whose name? (before it's news) tnd guest contributor: natalia meden | 2014 is gone. 100 years ago the great war of 1914-1918 was unleashed to take away many millions of human lives and destroy four empires. now the old continent is threatened again. the ominous signs are visible; the information about ukraine is reduced to a minimum by european media outlets. this approach is not only myope and light-minded – they misinform people and the deceit could lead to tragic consequences. prominent people who described the eventsof wwi forthwith,like, for instance, grand admiralalfred friedrich von tirpitz, have provided irrefutable evidence of the fact that european politicians had underestimated the threat of all-out war till the last moment. a number of warnings on this account have already been voiced in germany. in early december, 60 prominent german personalities from the realms of politics, economics, culture and the media signed a letter published by die zeit “war in europe again? not in our names!” all the politicians who signed the paper have been ranking officials in the past: a former federal president, a former chancellor, former federal ministers and former prime ministers of federal lands. only former big shots – never incumbents. that’s life. that’s what german politics is about – the rules are strict and nobody wants to doom his or her political career. the idea to publish the letter

Article 6 - cameron’s pumping out fear. boris hope.
are you frit? are you frightened? have they spooked you yet? it is now obvious that the remain campaign is intended to provoke only one emotion in the breast of the british public and that is fear. they want us to go to the polls in such a state of quivering apprehension that we do the bidding of the euro-elites, and vote to stay in the european union. we may accept, intellectually, that the system is unreformed, and often corrupt, and increasingly anti-democratic. we may recognise that if we were asked to join now, for the first time, that we would not dream of doing so. we may at one level understand that if we vote to remain, we will continue to sit trapped like passengers in the back seat of some errant minicab with a driver who cannot speak english and who is taking us remorselessly and expensively in the wrong direction. “i am ever more convinced that the real risk is to sit back and do nothing, to remain inertly and complacently in an unreformed eu that is hell-bent on a federal project over which we have no control.” but the remain camp clearly calculate that when it comes to the choice – between exit now, or an ever-more constricting entanglement – we will funk it; we won’t take the risk; we will stick with the devil we know. to encourage us in that decision, they are making a series of questionable assertions. we are told

Article 1 - francis, in christmas day message, focuses on children in peril
“so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference” are affected by hardness of the heart, he said, calling for reflection and change. and he chided the vatican’s bureaucratic machine in another address this week for losing touch with its spiritual side in the pursuit of power. as christians exchanged gifts and shared family meals, the pope’s thoughts were with the world’s dispossessed, refugees and exiles, those suffering “brutal” ethnic or religious persecution and those held as hostages or killed because of their religious beliefs. “truly there are so many tears this christmas,” francis said from the central balcony of st. peter’s basilica before thousands of faithful in the square below. the address was also broadcast live on the internet. photo to underscore his closeness to those suffering religious persecution, a theme of his nearly two years as pope, on christmas eve, francis spoke with displaced christians who are in a tent camp in northern iraq and told them that they were like jesus. many in the camps have been forced to leave their homes by militants of the islamic state. “you are like jesus on the night of his birth when he had been forced to flee,” the pope told them in a telephone call broadcast live by an italian catholic television station. “you are like jesus in this situation, and that means we are praying even harder for you.” the pope also denounced abortion, and his thoughts turned to “infants killed in

Article 2 - ‘dangerous games’
governments tend to assume that proper attention and care of the past will do the present good. in the united states, the national historic preservation act assumes that a sense of the past will help make good americans. the nation's heritage must be preserved, it says, ""in order to give a sense of orientation to the american people."" president george w. bush's executive order of 2003 titled ""preserve america"" echoed that sentiment: ""the federal government shall recognize and manage the historic properties in its ownership as assets that can support department and agency missions while contributing to the vitality and economic well-being of the nation's communities and fostering a broader appreciation for the development of the united states and its underlying values."" the passion for the past is clearly about more than market forces or government policies. history responds to a variety of needs, from greater understanding of ourselves and our world to answers about what to do. for many human beings, an interest in the past starts with themselves. that is in part a result of biology. like other creatures, humans have a beginning and an ending, and in between lies their story. it probably also has to do with the realization that today the great majority of people live in a rapidly changing world where long-standing relationships that were once taken for granted — whether with places or with people such as family or friends — no longer exist for many. part of the current fascination with preserving heritage comes from the fear that we are losing priceless and irreplaceable pieces of

Article 3 - fighting in the air
any new history of world war ii must clear a high bar to distinguish itself from the competitors that fill the shelves of libraries and bookstores. as our so-called greatest generation fades away, its memory appears better preserved than that of any other cohort of combatants in modern history, thanks to hundreds (if not thousands) of popular histories, memoirs, scholarly and military treatises dissecting the period and its players. michael korda’s “with wings like eagles,” his new volume on the battle of britain, clears this hurdle in a modest way, by stepping back from the minutiae of the clash between the royal air force and the luftwaffe in 1940 to focus on the truly critical events that determined the outcome. the book soars in those parts in which korda describes how the british prepared for the war in the skies, or how the germans failed time and again to deliver a knockout blow. determining the decisive point of any battle is the quintessential challenge of wartime command. the great military leaders have possessed a preternatural ability to see through the fog of war, as von clausewitz described it, to find that moment and marshal their forces at precisely the time and place, and in precisely the right manner, to prevail against an enemy attempting to do exactly the same thing. in the late 1930s, britain’s politicians and generals could see war over the horizon. after watching german and italian forces advance into parts of europe and africa,

Article 7 - what is a european
in april, romano prodi, an italian and the current president of the european commission -- the european union's executive body- criticized the british for defensiveness and timidity with regard to playing their ''full part'' in europe, while they behaved (in a comparison he excised before he gave the speech) like the tiny back wheel of a penny-farthing bicycle in the ''special relationship'' with the states. but i have not detected any strong sense of european identity among italians i know. one wrote in answer to my question that, after seeing the restored frescoes of piero della francesca in arezzo, she felt culturally european, ''even if probably i feel more italian.'' ''politically, if the enlightenment, if liberté, égalité, fraternité, if the ideals of the anti-fascist and anti-nazist men and women still were political european feelings (not only cultural issues), well, i could feel politically european, but they're not. i really hate this european fortress, this cold euro-fortress.'' from another point of view, italy feels very distant from the centers of european power. i was discussing the increasing split between the north and south of that (in european terms) recently unified country, on a boat crossing from capri to naples. i said to the group of italian journalists and university teachers i was with that perhaps europe would provide a place in which intense local identities could co-exist

Title: the christmas truce of world war i
Content: the christmas truce of world war i headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! in august 1914, europe’s major powers threw themselves into war with gleeful abandon. germany, a rising power with vast aspirations, plowed across belgium, seeking to checkmate france quickly before russia could mobilize, thereby averting the prospect of a two-front war. thousands of young germans, anticipating a six-week conflict, boarded troop trains singing the optimistic refrain: “ausflug nach paris. auf widersehen auf dem boulevard.” (“excursion to paris. see you again on the boulevard.”) the french were eager to avenge the loss of alsace and lorraine to germany in 1870. the british government, leery of germany’s growing power, mobilized hundreds of thousands of young men to “teach the hun a lesson.” across the continent, writes british historian simon rees, “millions of servicemen, reservists and volunteers … rushed enthusiastically to the banners of war…. the atmosphere was one of holiday rather than conflict.” each side expected to be victorious by christmas. but as december dawned, the antagonists found themselves mired along the western front – a static line of trenches running for hundreds of miles through france and belgium. at some points along the front, combatants were separated by less than 100 feet. their crude redoubts were little more than large ditches scooped out of miry, whitish-gray soil. ill-equipped for winter, soldiers slogged through brackish water that was too cold for human comfort, but too warm to freeze. the unclaimed territory designated no man’s land was littered with the awful residue of war – expended ammunition and the lifeless bodies of those on whom the ammunition had been spent. the mortal remains of many slain soldiers could be found grotesquely woven into barbed wire fences. villages and homes lay in ruins. abandoned churches had been appropriated for use as military bases. as losses mounted and the stalemate hardened, war fever began to dissipate on both sides. many of those pressed into service on the western front had not succumbed to the initial frenzy of bloodlust. fighting alongside french, belgian, and english troops were hindus and sikhs from india, as well as gurkhas from the himalayan kingdom of nepal. these colonial conscripts had been transported from their native soil and deployed in trenches carved out of wintry belgian cabbage patches. highland scots were also found at the front, proudly wearing their kilts in defiance of the bitter december cold. the german troops were led by elite prussian officers, representatives of the bellicose junker aristocracy. the german rank and file included bavarian, saxon, westphalian, and hessian reservists, more than a few of whom had lived – or even been born – in england and

(before it's news) paul joseph watson prison planet two new videos recently released by the department of homeland security add to the mountain of evidence that proves big sis has now dispensed with all pretense of the war on terror being focused on al-qaeda muslims, as tools that were designed to catch foreign terrorists are now being targeted against americans who are opposed to big government. the two recent psas (watch them below), part of homeland security’s “see something say something” snitch campaign, portray white middle class americans as terrorists in almost all of the scenarios shown in the clips. far from representing some superficial nod to political correctness, this is in fact a deliberate effort by the feds to characterize predominantly white, middle class, politically engaged americans as domestic extremists. it’s all part of the agenda to frame dissent against big government as dangerous radicalism. contrary to claims by the dhs that it does not profile, the bulk of literature and other training tools issued by the federal government over the last decade clearly go to great lengths to demonize informed, middle class, and predominately white americans as the most likely terrorists, despite the fact that the 126 people who were indictedon terrorist-related charges in the united states over the last two years were all muslim. in addition to recent rhetoric

Article 1 - blaming political correctness for trump is like blaming the civil rights movement for jim crow | lindy west | opinion
i ’ll never forget the moment, in one of the 2015 republican primary debates, when donald trump looked into the camera and declared that destroying political correctness was his no 1 campaign issue. his fans went berserk, both in the crowd and, especially, online. oh my god, i thought, even then. he’s courting the troll vote. sure enough, over the subsequent year, i watched as wildly disparate groups of men from the slimiest corners of the internet – anti-feminists, antisemites, anti-choicers, white nationalists, gun fetishists, islamophobes, rightwing talk-radio toadies, garden-variety good old boys – coalesced into one sprawling, frothing hydra behind donald trump. when mainstream news outlets started churning out thinkpieces about the mysterious “alt-right”, the wicked green engine of trump’s base , i wanted to scream. feminists and other social justice activists already know what the “alt-right” is – it’s a roll call of the angry men who’ve been stalking, harassing, abusing and trying to silence us for years. the only thing they have in common is a fixation on the spectre of “political correctness”, a vaguely pejorative catch-all for post-martin luther king social activism, and in trump they found their champion: the alpha male who was finally going to give these bitches what they deserve. (i can’t adequately convey how sickening it

Article 2 - sharpton and 3 from bronx are jailed in vieques protest
but the civil disobedience could backfire. at the very least, these prison sentences, if upheld, could complicate the political campaigns of at least two candidates. mr. ramirez is a central figure in the mayoral campaign of fernando ferrer, the bronx borough president, serving both as a day-to-day strategic adviser and as the leader of his drive to collect the thousands of signatures needed to get on the september primary ballot. mr. carrión, meanwhile, is running for bronx borough president. he must also collect signatures by the july petition deadline. he and the other three new york politicians had expected earlier this week that they might just receive fines, one of their lawyers said, learning only tuesday that they were required to get to san juan immediately for trial. appeals by the four will be filed in boston today, with each seeking to be released from jail pending the appeal, their lawyers said. one of the lawyers representing the four pleaded with the judge to postpone such a hastily called trial, but the judge refused and a federal prosecutor began calling officers who witnessed the protests to testify. ''i don't come from puerto rico,'' mr. sharpton told judge fuste at the three-hour trial yesterday afternoon. ''but i am one for standing up for something that is right. this building will be closed next january in honor of martin luther king, who stood for civil rights. before you sentence me, i would like to wish you a happy

Article 3 - how fake news goes viral: a case study
how fake news goes viral: a case study image images posted on twitter by a marketer in austin, tex., the day after the presidential election. credit eric tucker, a 35-year-old co-founder of a marketing company in austin, tex., had just about 40 twitter followers. but his recent tweet about paid protesters being bused to demonstrations against president-elect donald j. trump fueled a nationwide conspiracy theory — one that mr. trump joined in promoting. mr. tucker's post was shared at least 16,000 times on twitter and more than 350,000 times on facebook. the problem is that mr. tucker got it wrong. there were no such buses packed with paid protesters. but that didn't matter. while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. here, the new york times deconstructs how mr. tucker’s now-deleted declaration on twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon. it is an example of how, in an ever-connected world where speed often takes precedence over truth, an observation by a private citizen can quickly become a talking point, even as it is being proved false. nov. 9, shortly after 8 p.m. eastern image credit snopes mr

",0.8
6190384.0,fake,fake,0.8,113.5840072631836,True," The article does not match the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY in several ways. Firstly, the article makes a claim that Saudi Arabia is ""boycotting American products"" and gouging oil prices, which is not supported by any facts mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. Additionally, the article mentions specific companies like Sunoco, Conoco, and Maverick that do not import Middle Eastern oil, but these claims are contradicted by the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.  Furthermore, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains several inaccuracies, such as the claim that Saudi Arabia has overstated its oil reserves by 40% (which is not mentioned in the article), and the mention of a partnership between Saudi Arabia and China to build an oil refinery. The article does not support these claims.  The only similarity between the two summaries is the discussion on energy markets, but even this is not accurately represented in the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY. Overall, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains several inaccuracies and contradictions that make it clear that the article is not a reliable source of information.","The articles discuss various topics related to energy markets, oil reserves, and the impact of global events on prices. 

According to Article 1, some major gasoline companies that do not import oil from the Middle East include Shell (205,742,000 barrels) and Chevron/Texaco (144,332,000 barrels). However, it is essential to note that these companies still source a significant portion of their oil from the region.

Article 2 reveals that Saudi Arabia has overstated its oil reserves by 40% (300 billion barrels), according to WikiLeaks. This news may indicate that the country's production has peaked, and global oil prices could increase.

Article 3 discusses the energy market trends, with some analysts predicting a bearish outlook due to weak economic growth and increased inventories. However, the article also notes that the Japanese are buying more oil to compensate for their nuclear reactors' shutdowns.

Article 4 reports on Saudi Arabia's new partnership with China to build a massive oil refinery in Yanbu by 2014. This project could potentially disrupt the petrodollar system, which has been a cornerstone of global trade since the 1970s.

Article 5 highlights President Obama's decision to release 30 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) but notes that this move did not significantly impact oil prices. The article attributes the price stability to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's looming resignation and a weak dollar.

Article 6 provides insight into the petrodollar system, which was engineered by Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. The article emphasizes that the US is consistently the top exporter of refined oil products but notes that this does not necessarily mean they need more oil.

Article 7 discusses the choice between Saudi and American oil, highlighting the significant price difference between the two. However, it's essential to consider the broader context of global energy markets and the impact of various factors on prices.

Article 8 quotes biblical passages that describe a time of great distress and upheaval, which some interpret as a warning about the impending collapse of the current economic system.","The US is experiencing a shift in its energy reality, with increased oil production and reduced dependence on imports. The US has seen a 25% rise in oil production since 2008, primarily from tight oil formations. This has led to North Dakota overtaking California as the nation's third-largest oil-producing state.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is facing criticism for high gasoline prices, with President Trump calling for action to be taken against the country. However, a sell-off of US assets by Saudi Arabia could have negative consequences for the country itself.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for American diplomats, with President Obama's trip to Israel being relatively low-key. The end of the Cold War and structural changes in the region have contributed to this shift.

A report on climate change suggests that investing in renewable energy could be cost-effective, but may not be politically easy. The report recommends eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and adopting initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainable development.

where do you buy your gas? this story from tom ohalloran may influence you to change your habits! gas rationing in the 70’s worked even though we grumbled about it. it might even have been good for us! are you aware that the saudis are boycotting american products? in addition, they are gouging us on oil prices. shouldn’t we return the favor? can’t we take control of our own destiny and let these giant oil importers know who really generates their profits, their livings? how about leaving american dollars in america and reduce the import/export deficit? an appealing remedy might be to boycott their gas. every time you fill up your car you can avoid putting more money into the coffers of saudi arabia. just purchase gas from companies that don’t import their oil from the saudis. nothing is more frustrating than the feeling that every time i fill up my tank, i’m sending my money to people who i get the impression want me, my family and my friends dead. where to buy your usa-gas, this is very important to know. read on– every time you fill up the car, you can avoid putting more money into the coffers of saudi arabia just buy from gas companies that don’t import their oil from the saudis. these companies import middle eastern oil: shell………………………205,742,000 barrels chevron/texaco………144,332,000 barrels exxon

wikileaks: oil reserves in saudia arabia off by 40%! (before it's news) when i read this article at zero hedge, my stomach lurched and the hairs on my arm stood up. wikileaks reveals today that saudi arabia has overstated oil reserves by 300 billion barrels. the peak oil proponents have warned us that it was entirely possible that saudi arabia production had peaked and now it appears that it is true. the cables, released by wikileaks, urge washington to take seriously a warning from a senior saudi government oil executive that the kingdom’s crude oil reserves may have been overstated by as much as 300bn barrels – nearly 40%.” saudi arabia has been the “i got your back,” the backup, the country that could provide the oil at the margin to keep oil prices stable. this no longer seems to be true. no longer is there a way to stop the global rise in oil prices and china is stockpiling oil for its own needs. expect oil prices to take out $$100 soon and expect 6000 things made from oil to increase in price, including gasoline. why this country isn’t doing everything in its power to find new domestic reserves is nuts. the u.s. dept of energy has increased our dependence on foreign energy and the whole program is insane! read more at mover mike source:

Article 3 - who’s winning big in lopsided energy markets?: kim pacanovsky
who’s winning big in lopsided energy markets?: kim pacanovsky (before it's news) the energy report: in the past few weeks, commentators have expressed more varied sentiment on oil markets, with some pretty astute analysts now turning bearish. what do you see on the horizon? kim pacanovsky: you’re asking the question at the right time because the u.s. energy information administration (eia) inventories came out today, and they were up 8½ million barrels. that was an extremely bearish number, putting oil down over $$3 per barrel (bbl). but what oil does in the longer term is a complicated projection. first and foremost, “it’s the economy, stupid,” right? if it continues to weaken, we’re going to be using less oil. a few days ago, the organisation for economic co-operation and development forecast the g7 to have growth of about 0.3% in the third quarter. that’s a pretty weak number. the japanese have been helping the market by buying a lot of oil to make up for their off-line nuclear reactors, but that purchasing may slow down. we have a price range between $$90100/bbl to the end of 2013. i would be reluctant to change that right now. once the election is over and some of the stimulus measures take effect, i think we’ll get back to that higher number. it’s politically very bad for saudi arabia to

saudi arabia and china team up to build a gigantic new oil refinery – is this the beginning of the end for the petrodollar? % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the largest oil exporter in the middle east has teamed up with the second largest consumer of oil in the world (china) to build a gigantic new oil refinery and the mainstream media in the united states has barely even noticed it. this mammoth new refinery is scheduled to be fully operational in the red sea port city of yanbu by 2014. over the past several years, china has sought to aggressively expand trade with saudi arabia, and china now actually imports more oil from saudi arabia than the united states does. in february, china imported 1.39 million barrels of oil per day from saudi arabia. that was 39 percent higher than last february. so why is this important? well, back in 1973 the united states and saudi arabia agreed that all oil sold by saudi arabia would be denominated in u.s. dollars. this petrodollar system was adopted by almost the entire world and it has had great benefits for the u.s. economy. but if china becomes saudi arabia’s most important trading partner, then why should saudi arabia continue to only sell oil in u.s. dollars? and if the petrodollar system collapses, what is that going

Article 5 - obama unleashed the spr, and achieved…nothing
obama unleashed the spr, and achieved…nothing (before it's news) on wednesday, june 22nd, the price of oil closed at $$95.41. the following day president obama announced to great fanfare the release of 30 million barrels of crude over the next 30 days from the strategic petroleum reserve (spr) with an eye on reducing oil’s price. mildly sentient minds with a basic sense of oil-price history knew it wouldn’t work, and sure enough, one week later – yesterday – oil closed at $$95.25. as of today oil is trending down to $$94/barrel, but this can be chalked up to treasury secretary tim geithner’s looming resignation. as this piece will make abundantly clear, the price of oil is a dollar phenomenon, and with a weak dollar treasury secretary getting ready to depart, gold is down $$19/ounce in concert with increased dollar strength, thus helping to explain oil’s slight weakness relative to yesterday. what’s perhaps not so fascinating or surprising about the turn of events in the past week has been the response from those who should know better. those in the oil/economic commentariat still deluded by the false notion that the oil price is a supply phenomenon cheered obama’s decision while trotting out “studies” from goldman sachs and other oil-price insiders saying that the release of new supply to make up for an alleged libyan shortfall would bring down the price of a barrel

Article 6 - answer to milt farrow, or, stop being stupid part seven
answer to milt farrow, or, stop being stupid part seven (before it's news) by anna von reitz some americans–at least the ones i consort with— know that the petro dollar was engineered by kissinger because we are consistently the top exporter of refined oil products in the world and always have been. (get a clue: we are also the main supplier of guns and weapons and “defense supplies and materials”. we never re-tooled our industries for peace time after world war ii. we kept right on chugging out the same old crap and developing new versions of it and promoting wars for profit all over the world.) other americans think that we are in constant dire need of oil and can never get enough oil—– and don’t make the distinction between crude oil —- the raw material that we can’t get enough of, and refined oil products— which we can’t offload fast enough. beyond paying for part of the nasty government operations none of us approve of, none of this has anything to do with arabs buying treasury bonds. arabs do that because they figure that treasury bonds are a good safe place to store the value of their money, and as long as the world has an oil-based economy, they are right. when big oil goes down as a result of new technology being released all those who have depended on the value of oil to back-stop their currencies and foreign trade markets, most especially the us and russia and the middle

Article 1 - america’s new energy reality
the other part is the supply side — the turnaround in united states oil production, which has risen 25 percent since 2008. it could increase by 600,000 barrels per day this year. the biggest part of the increase is coming from what has become the “new thing” in energy — tight oil. that is the term for oil produced from tight rock formations with the same technology used to produce shale gas. tight oil is redrawing the map of north american oil. at the beginning of this year, north dakota overtook california as the nation’s third largest oil-producing state. it didn’t stop there. it just overtook alaska, to become no. 2 after texas. tight oil could reach more than four million barrels per day by 2020. what really brings home the new reality is a milestone attained last year: in 2011, the united states registered the largest increase in oil production of any country outside of opec. if one takes a broader north american perspective, the changes in the supply picture are even more striking. the output of canadian oil sands has tripled since 2000 and is now greater than libya’s output before its civil war began in february 2011. this adds up to a very different outlook from a few years ago. until fairly recently, energy independence was a subject to get laughs. the joke was that america was actually becoming more and more dependent upon imports. but now “energy independence” has become a

Article 2 - saudi arabia, you're fired!
donald j. trump has had it with high gasoline prices -- and if it were up to him, we just wouldn't put up with it any more. in his blog on the site of trump university (donald j. trump, chairman), he voices outrage at the ''horrific milestone'' of americans paying as much as $3 a gallon (about half what they pay in europe, but never mind) and states flatly, ''that's just ridiculous.'' he makes a nod to a partial solution (we should ''get on the ball with alternative energy''), but he saves his true magisterial indignation for all this pussyfooting with saudi arabia. ''just threaten to stop protecting'' those oil-producing countries, he said, and watch prices plummet. but the real solution, of course, is alarmingly simple: call off those wimpy politicians. ''send a true business leader,'' he writes, ''someone who is used to tough bargaining.'' after some ''serious talking,'' he vows, ''those prices would drop like a rock -- guaranteed.'' hmm. does he have someone in mind? hubert b. herring

Article 3 - mr. obama goes to israel
in case you haven’t heard, president obama leaves for israel next week. it is possible, though, that you haven’t heard because it is hard for me to recall a less-anticipated trip to israel by an american president. but there is a message in that empty bottle: little is expected from this trip — not only because little is possible, but because, from a narrow u.s. point of view, little is necessary. quietly, with nobody announcing it, the israeli-palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for american diplomats. like any hobby — building model airplanes or knitting sweaters — some days you work on it, some days you don’t. it depends on your mood, but it doesn’t usually matter when that sweater gets finished. obama worked on this hobby early in his first term. he got stuck as both parties rebuffed him, and, therefore, he adopted, quite rationally in my view, an attitude of benign neglect. it was barely noticed. the shift in the israeli-palestinian conflict from necessity to hobby for the u.s. is driven by a number of structural changes, beginning with the end of the cold war. there was a time when it was truly feared that an arab-israeli war could trigger a wider superpower conflict. during the october 1973 war, president nixon raised america’s military readiness to defcon 3 to signal the soviets to stay away

Article 4 - fixing climate change may add no costs, report says
“this is a massive amount of investment firepower that could be geared toward building better cities, and better infrastructure for energy and agriculture,” said jeremy oppenheim, who led the research for the report. while the commission found that the requisite steps may make economic sense, that does not mean they will be politically easy, the report says. for instance, the group will recommend that countries eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost about $600 billion a year but are vigorously defended by vested interests. it will urge nations to take a fresh look at the potential of renewable energy, whose costs are plummeting, and also recommend the adoption of initiatives to halt destruction of forests, use land more efficiently and limit wasteful urban sprawl, among many other steps. the claim that the side benefits, such as better air quality, could potentially offset the costs is likely to be controversial. the intergovernmental panel on climate change, a united nations body, found in a report earlier this year that these side benefits are real, but it declined to attach a specific value to them because the methodology for doing so is difficult and uncertain. the exercise requires, for instance, defining the economic worth of improved human health. ottmar g. edenhofer, a german climate economist who helped lead that earlier effort, said in an interview monday that he was doubtful about the precise values for the side benefits cited in the new report. he served as an adviser to the global commission, but is not an author of the final

Article 5 - saudi threat to sell u.s. assets could hurt, but mostly the saudis
however, a sell-off could be self-defeating for saudi arabia. the port arthur refinery highlights the cost of pulling back. the refinery is owned by motiva enterprises, a joint venture between royal dutch shell and saudi aramco, the state-owned oil giant. aramco has a long history of investing in the united states, in part to facilitate the sale of saudi oil to american consumers. last month, aramco announced a deal to take full ownership of the refinery, along with a network of 26 distribution terminals and the rights to sell fuel under the shell brand name across a large swath of the united states, including texas. the saudis might be able to sell the refinery, but they would lose a strategic investment. “for a producer that big, you have to be in every market in the world to place your oil,” said elizabeth rosenberg, director of the energy, economics and security program at the center for a new american security. aramco also invests in technologies, including the $10 million stake in nanomech in arkansas, announced last week, and part ownership of at least eight other small american companies. there is no comprehensive public accounting of the saudi government’s investments in the united states, although american officials say $750 billion is a plausible figure. photo and the single largest chunk of that money is probably invested in treasury securities. the treasury department says a group of 15 “oil-exporting

Article 6 - oil’s swift fall raises fortunes of u.s. abroad
iran has been hit so hard that its government, looking for ways to fill a widening hole in its budget, is offering young men the option of buying their way out of an obligatory two years of military service. “we are on the eve of a major crisis,” an iranian economist, hossein raghfar, told the etemaad newspaper on sunday. “the government needs money badly.” venezuela, which has the world’s largest estimated oil reserves and has used them to position itself as a foil to american “imperialism,” received 95 percent of its export earnings from petroleum before prices fell. it is now having trouble paying for social projects at home and for a foreign policy rooted in oil-financed largess, including shipments of reduced-price petroleum to cuba and elsewhere. photo amid worries on bond markets that venezuela might default on its loans, president nicolás maduro, who was elected last year after the death of mr. chávez, has said the country will continue to pay its debts. but inflation in venezuela is over 60 percent, there are shortages of many basic goods, and many experts believe the economy is in recession. but the biggest casualty so far has probably been russia, where energy revenue accounts for more than half of the government’s budget. mr. putin built up strong support by seeming to banish the economic turmoil that had afflicted the rule of his predecessor, boris n. yeltsin. yet russia was back

Article 7 - saudi minister says opec should not curtail production
""most probably there is no need to do anything to the ceiling or the level of production,"" mr. naimi of saudi arabia said after arriving in kuwait for monday's meeting. ""we will do our best to maintain reliable and secure supplies to the market, as usual,"" he said. the group pumps some 30 million barrels a day, including about 1.8 million barrels from iraq. most members are producing at full capacity, except for saudi arabia, which still has some unused potential. some ministers suggested that opec might decide on monday to call for a meeting in january, ahead of its planned gathering in march, to discuss possible cuts in supplies before the start of the second quarter. the idea of an early meeting was raised by the kuwaiti minister and backed by the representative from qatar. ""i'm always concerned about the second quarter,"" abdullah bin hamad al-attiyah, the oil minister from qatar, told reporters. ""because you see today, there is more oil in the market and hopefully this oil will not reflect negatively in the second quarter."" ""demand for oil always drops drastically in the second quarter,"" he added, ""so we have to be cautious and learn from the lessons of the past."" producers outside of opec are expected to add as much as one million barrels a day of new supplies next year, with another 500,000 to 1 million barrels coming from opec countries.

Article 8 - saudi arabia calls for summit on energy costs
saudi arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, said on monday that it wanted to convene an energy summit of producers and consumers to focus on “how to objectively deal” with high prices. after a cabinet meeting led by king abdullah, the saudi government said, “the increase in prices isn’t justified in terms of market fundamentals,” according to a statement from the official saudi press agency. the proposal comes as gasoline prices are surging to record highs and political exasperation in washington over high oil costs is mounting. no date was given for the energy summit. iyad madani, the kingdom’s information minister, said saudi arabia would also work with other opec members to “guarantee the availability of oil supplies, now and in the future.” advertisement continue reading the main story few analysts expect that a concerted effort by producers and consumers will push down prices. still, the saudi statement, while vague, helped prick the momentum of last week, when oil prices gained an unprecedented $16 a barrel over two days of trading. oil futures fell $4.19 on monday to close at $134.35 a barrel.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US is experiencing a shift in its energy reality, with increased oil production and reduced dependence on imports. The US has seen a 25% rise in oil production since 2008, primarily from tight oil formations. This has led to North Dakota overtaking California as the nation's third-largest oil-producing state.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is facing criticism for high gasoline prices, with President Trump calling for action to be taken against the country. However, a sell-off of US assets by Saudi Arabia could have negative consequences for the country itself.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for American diplomats, with President Obama's trip to Israel being relatively low-key. The end of the Cold War and structural changes in the region have contributed to this shift.

A report on climate change suggests that investing in renewable energy could be cost-effective, but may not be politically easy. The report recommends eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels and adopting initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainable development.

Oil prices are surging to record highs, with gasoline prices reaching $3 a gallon. Saudi Arabia has called for an energy summit to focus on ""how to objectively deal"" with high prices. However, few analysts expect that this will lead to a significant decrease in prices.

In other news, Iran is facing economic challenges due to falling oil prices, while Venezuela's economy is struggling with inflation and shortages of basic goods. Russia is also feeling the effects of reduced energy revenue, which accounts for more than half of

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various topics related to energy markets, oil reserves, and the impact of global events on prices. 

According to Article 1, some major gasoline companies that do not import oil from the Middle East include Shell (205,742,000 barrels) and Chevron/Texaco (144,332,000 barrels). However, it is essential to note that these companies still source a significant portion of their oil from the region.

Article 2 reveals that Saudi Arabia has overstated its oil reserves by 40% (300 billion barrels), according to WikiLeaks. This news may indicate that the country's production has peaked, and global oil prices could increase.

Article 3 discusses the energy market trends, with some analysts predicting a bearish outlook due to weak economic growth and increased inventories. However, the article also notes that the Japanese are buying more oil to compensate for their nuclear reactors' shutdowns.

Article 4 reports on Saudi Arabia's new partnership with China to build a massive oil refinery in Yanbu by 2014. This project could potentially disrupt the petrodollar system, which has been a cornerstone of global trade since the 1970s.

Article 5 highlights President Obama's decision to release 30 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) but notes that this move did not significantly impact oil prices. The article attributes the price stability to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's looming resignation and a weak dollar.

There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made by the author are supported by data and historical context provided in the article.","The articles discuss the current state of the gold market, with varying predictions and analysis. Article 1 mentions a potential short-term correction in gold prices, citing a recent article predicting a decline to $1320 by the end of the year.

Article 2 highlights a rare setup in the gold and Swiss franc markets, suggesting that gold may be ""down for years to come."" However, this is not universally agreed upon.

Article 3 notes that precious metals are experiencing lower price forecasts and outflows from ETFs, potentially leading to another sell-off. Despite this, some investors remain optimistic about a potential rebound.

Article 4 analyzes the gold market, suggesting that it is nearing a big move. The author notes that gold has tested major resistance levels twice and failed both times, indicating a potential decline if support is lost.

Article 5 provides an update on the gold market, stating that it has arrived in an area of strong support above its rising 200-day moving average. A bullish candlestick pattern, known as a ""piercing pattern,"" appeared on the chart, suggesting a reversal.

Article 6 discusses the recent rally in gold and silver prices, attributing it to extreme bearish sentiment and the European rescue package not being a done deal. The author notes that economic rules controlling inflation are out of window, providing a powerful uplift to gold.

Article 7 cites market technician Jordan Roy-Byrne's charts predicting that precious metals will outperform the S&P 500 in the near term. However, this is based on a negative correlation between precious metals and the equity market that began in the summer of 2011.

Article 8 reports that gold stocks (GDX) have slid, remaining ""undervalued"" despite the decline. The author attributes this to factors such as Barrick Gold's acquisition of a copper company and investors buying gold instead of mining equities.","Here's a concise summary of the articles:

A Texas judge blocked overtime rules that would have affected 4.2 million workers, benefiting dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree. The rule required workers earning up to $47,476 per year to track their hours for overtime pay.

**European Equities Slump Amid Weaker Utilities**

The Stoxx 600 index closed 0.2% higher on Monday, despite a slump in bond-proxy sectors following a rally in bond yields. Utilities were among the sharpest losers, while banks gained.

Article 4 - gold & gold stocks nearing a big move
gold & gold stocks nearing a big move (before it's news) gold and especially gold mining stocks rebounded on wednesday and trended higher into the weekend. this is giving some investors renewed hopes that the bull market that began roughly 18 months ago is about to reassert itself. we cannot know for sure yet but what we can say is precious metals are nearing a big move. gold and gold stocks have traded in tight ranges which will compress further while volatility indicators approach multi-year lows. this is the setup for a break and then a powerful move with increasing momentum and volatility. first let’s take a look at gold. its weekly bar chart is shown (going back 10 years) with two volatility indicators at the bottom. one is the gvz contract and one is the average true range (atr) indicator. the atr indicator is at a 10-year low while gvz is near an 8-year low. gold has tested major resistance ($$1300) twice and failed both times. if gold loses its 2017 uptrend (support is around $$1230) then it is susceptible to an accelerated decline with increasing volatility and momentum. on the other hand, if gold could bust through $$1300 and then consolidate around $$1350, it could setup that anticipated breakout through $$1350-$$1375. turning to the gold stocks, we plot a 10-year bar chart of gdx along with the atr indicator and the bollinger band width for two

Article 5 - gold market update
– posted sunday, 30 january 2011 | share this article| source: goldseek.com a rare and exceptional opportunity has just presented itself to enter this precious metals bullmarket at very favorable prices for gold, silver and especially for precious metals stocks – right at an intermediate bottom. that is what our latest studies indicate. while gold dropped a little lower last week than expected in the last update, it has arrived in an area of strong support above its rising 200-day moving average in a deeply oversold condition, as we can see on its 8-month chart below. thus it is interesting to observe that a bullish candlestick pattern, known as a “piercing pattern”, appeared on its chart on thursday and friday, which frequently signifies a reversal. the downturn in gold and silver has not unnaturally brought bears out of hiding, and they of course are to be found in large numbers near market bottoms. the claim of some of them is that gold has been marking out a bearish rising wedge. that is not how it looks to us – instead we see a fine parallel channel with a parallel inner uptrend at which the last upleg halted. this can be seen on our 2-year chart and also how, with gold having just arrived at the lower boundary of this uptrend channel in a deeply oversold condition on its medium-term macd indicator, we are at the optimum buy spot right now – which explains the aggressive buying on friday that completed the piercing pattern.

Article 6 - it’s all better now
it’s all better now (before it's news) by neil charnock goldoz.com.au introduction gold reached us$$1248.20 which was a new record high in usd. silver has also followed gold up, this rally looks like the real thing. i have to stand corrected here as i was off the mark a little in some recent statements. i forecast us$$1180 as an interim top and it only reached $$1170 before pulling back to the $$1140 level. i had also thought we would have pulled back for longer and that this rally would be a false break out. so much for short term forecasting it is extremely difficult. this short term forecast turned out wrong thanks to one trillion more reasons potentially circulating in europe. the european rescue package is not a done deal as there are all kinds of caveats to clear first. markets have appeared unconvinced this will either happen or actually help at all in the longer term. economic rules that control inflation are out the window and confidence in the euro is hitting very low levels providing a powerful uplift to gold. there is talk of the weaker nations being evicted from the euro and talk of the stronger ones leaving to save their own hide. none of this is good for confidence in european economic output or the currency. there is also the strong sense of futility; that they might be able to borrow however will not be able to repay the debt leaving the system even more exposed to default in future. gold is now the

Article 7 - market technician jordan roy-byrne’s charts predict precious metals will outperform
market technician jordan roy-byrne’s charts predict precious metals will outperform (before it's news) the gold report: since november, there’s been a decisive break between the s&p 500 and gold, bullion and the amex gold bugs index (hui:nyse). the hui has provided leverage to gold, but it’s been leverage to the downside. there are new highs on the s&p 500 almost daily. does that mean that you’re looking for new lows in mining equities? jordan roy-byrne: there’s been a negative correlation between precious metals and the equity market that became quite pronounced in november. however, the negative correlation really began in the summer of 2011, when gold peaked at $$1,900/ounce ($$1,900/oz) and the hui gold stock index and market vectors gold miners etf (gdx:nysearca) also peaked. the negative correlation is in place over a long period and not necessarily over a day-to-day or week-to-week period. the precious metals complex has likely bottomed due to extreme bearish sentiment. in the near term, i think a move higher in the s&p 500 could be speculative and actually benefit mining shares before the larger correlation comes back into play. many investors forget history. everyone is focused on what happened in 2008. there were times in the 1960s through the 1980s, during that bull market

gold stocks (gdx) slide, remain “undervalued” headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! gold stocks news – gold stocks fell tuesday as the market vectors gold miners etf (gdx) slid $1.04 to $62.66 per share. the sell-off in gold stocks and the gdx came as gold futures tumbled to $1,875 after earlier reaching a new record high of $1,917.90 per ounce. the s&p/tsx global gold index, a leading basket of gold stocks in canada, fell 1.8% in concert with the gdx. today’s weakness in gold stocks follows yesterday’s 3.9% rally in the gdx, which brought the gold stocks etf into positive territory on a year-to-date basis. however, with this morning’s decline, the gdx cut its monthly and year-to-date gains to 10.1% and 1.6%, respectively. this compares rather unfavorably to the yellow metal, which has surged 16.2% in august and 32.1% this year. commenting on the underperformance of gold stocks and the gdx relative to gold bullion, rodman & renshaw analyst wayne atwell attributed the weakness to four factors: “barrick gold (abx), the largest gold company is acquiring a copper company, which demonstrates a lack of confidence in gold, 2) investors are buying gold

dollar stores caught a break when a texas judge blocked overtime rules that would have taken effect on dec. 1, according to credit suisse analysts. district court judge amos mazzant ruled on tuesday that the labor department is not allowed to put in place the rule, which would require workers earning up to $47,476 per year to track their hours for overtime pay. the rule would apply to about 4.2 million workers . currently, workers making up to $23,660 are eligible for overtime. see also: obama administration is chastised once again by the judiciary dollar stores like dollar general corp. dg, +0.51% and dollar tree inc. dltr, +0.19% could have felt an impact of 5% of earnings on a gross basis before taking steps to mitigate the effect., according to credit suisse. “dollar stores would have been most heavily impacted by the new overtime rule given the sheer number of stores they operate and their unique low-cost labor model,” credit suisse said in a wednesday note. “with only two to three employees per store typically working at any given time, store managers comprise a significant percentage of store labor and generally work heavy overtime.” see also: dollar tree posts better-than-expected sales shop like a holiday bot (2:16) reality check: amazon.com doesn't always have the lowest prices. wsj personal tech columnist geoffrey a. fowler shows how to win at christmas

the first-quarter financial results from all the big banks have underscored the challenges facing the financial industry as it grapples with volatile markets and a wide array of new regulations that raise the cost of doing business. goldman is in a particularly difficult situation. it has again become a target during this election season, with the democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders using the bank as a symbol of wall street greed. at the same time, its reliance on trading and underwriting has made it more vulnerable than other big american banks to the new regulations and volatile markets. on tuesday, the bank reported the lowest first-quarter profit and revenue since 2004, with declines across almost all of the bank’s major business lines. the firm earned $1.1 billion, or $2.68 a share, down 55 percent from the same period a year earlier. analysts polled by thomson reuters had been expecting earnings of $2.45 a share. some analysts said that including certain one-time items, goldman did worse than they expected. goldman’s chief financial officer, harvey schwartz, defended the company’s approach — and suggested that analysts not focus too much on one quarter, particularly with the slide in the price of oil and the unstable outlook for interest rates. advertisement continue reading the main story but mr. schwartz also argued that the bank had been cutting employees and expenses to deal with the difficult environment. “this has been — and i admit it – this has been

Article 4 - investing; these days, gold earns its shine
historically, war fears have broadened gold's appeal. political instability usually breeds economic difficulties, prompting investors to seek a haven. but even if a war with iraq is avoided, weakness in the american economy will probably buoy gold's value, gold bugs say. ''the slowing economy has eliminated the fear of inflation, but it has raised concerns about deflation,'' said loyd j. stegent, president of stegent equity advisors in houston. ''since lower interest rates, have been slow to the rescue, the fed has had to take additional steps to prevent the deflationary abyss that occurred during the great depression,'' he said. ''so they have turned on the printing presses in an effort to reinflate the economy and have been buying treasuries.'' gold, of course, is always a hedge against inflation, the end result of printing money. to mr. stegent, the federal budget deficit also weakens the already slipping dollar sending more people to precious metals like gold as the haven of choice. he is telling clients to put 10 percent to 25 percent of their assets in gold mutual funds. virginia gerhart, a financial planner who runs her own firm in san rafael, calif., has favored a small allocation -- about 5 percent -- in gold since 1979. but, she says, picking individual stocks is a ''burden.'' investors have, for example, punished barrick gold, the world's third-largest gold producer

gold miner slump pushes tsx down; banks gain wed nov 23, 2016 6:39pm est [ - ] text [ + ] by alastair sharp toronto (reuters) - sharp losses among gold miners weighed heavily on canada's main stock index on wednesday as the precious metal slid to a nine-month low, with the falls offsetting solid gains for heavyweight banks and more subdued rises across most other sectors. a slew of gold mining stocks, including two of the world's largest gold producers, fell between 3 and 8 percent. gold prices slumped as strong u.s. data and the release of minutes from the last u.s. federal reserve policy meeting buoyed the u.s. currency to its highest level since 2003 and further cemented a case for increasing u.s. interest rates next month. barrick gold corp fell 4.5 percent to c$19.72, and goldcorp inc declined 4 percent to c$17.41. kinross gold corp lost 8.2 percent to c$4.26. the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies and accounts for 12 percent of the index's weight, lost 2.6 percent.

cyclical sectors led the stock market on thursday, setting the standard & poor’s 500-stock index up for its first negative week in six, after factory data showed a slowdown in both europe and china. the weak data is hardly a surprise for markets because many analysts have already factored in a recession in europe, and early this month china trimmed its 2012 growth target to an eight-year low of 7.5 percent. but investors were unnerved by the drop in new orders in both regions, which highlighted concerns that an unexpectedly severe downturn could hurt the global recovery. the drop in demand drove calls for the pullback in stocks; the s.& p. 500 has scored 10 weeks of gains out of 11 weeks this year. the benchmark index is still near four-year highs reached on monday. advertisement continue reading the main story “the advance we’ve had so far this year is not sustainable, and the market is taking a little breather,” said terry morris, senior equity manager for national penn investors trust company in reading, pa.

Title: gold and silver shares retest of 2010 breakout almost complete
Content: gold and silver shares retest of 2010 breakout almost complete (before it's news) at the start of the year we wrote about what we could expect from the gold stocks and juniors over the first half of the year. all of these markets experienced significant multi-year breakouts in late 2010. this year called for a retest of those breakouts before the next advance would begin. we believed that these markets would spend much of 2011 retesting the breakouts and that markets would later be in position for an unabated advance into 2012 and beyond. we wanted to provide an update on. first we have the nyse gold miners index. this is broader than the hui and gdx but generally follows the same pattern. the market brokeout in september 2010 and successfully retested the breakout in january and two weeks ago. the large cap miners have struggled but are now in an excellent position. essentially there is no resistance after the peaks near 1800. we also want to note that on any historical gold stock index, the 2008 highs are essentially the same as the 1980 highs. thus, the breakout in late 2010, if sustained is a historic breakout. our junior gold index (25 companies equal weighted) has been the strongest. it broke past its 2007 high in late 2009. the market has a larger retest zone than the others. the market recently bottomed at a strong confluence of support. the bottom came at the 62% retracement of the 2010 advance, an area of lateral support as well as our 300-day moving average band. we expect the low to be retested later this summer but it should hold. meanwhile our junior silver index (10 stocks equally weighted) has the clearest breakout/retest pattern. the market broke past 170 in late 2010 before reaching 240 in early 2010. the late january bottom occurred at 175. the recent bottom occurred at 210. these breakouts are from multi-year resistance so retests will generally last longer than a few months. there you have it. gold and silver shares have acted according to a big picture plan we laid out at the start of the year. major multi-year breakouts are always accompanied by a retest that can take months to play out. nine or twelve months from now this retest will be a distant memory and likely a missed opportunity for most to accumulate shares in a bull market that could is on the cusp of a major move higher. if you are looking for more analysis and professional guidance as to how to profit in this bull market, then we invite you to learn about our premium service. good luck! jordan roy-byrne, cmt jordan@thedailygold.com read more at daily gold source:

Article 1 - could a nuclear war in asia effect you? absolutely
could a nuclear war in asia effect you? absolutely headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! right now all eyes on north korea, which is totally understandable. the rhetoric being exchanged between our government and theirs has never been so heated, and at this point it wouldn’t be a surprise if war broke out. however, while the media has been parading an endless stream of worrisome stories on this subject, they’ve neglected to keep tabs on another brewing conflict between china and india. for weeks the two countries have been hashing out a war of words over a border dispute in bhutan. the chinese tried to build a road in disputed territory, and the indian army was deployed to block them. since then the chinese have been threatening to annihilate the indian soldiers if they aren’t removed. over the past month, the people’s liberation army (pla) has been on the move. we believe that the pla has made sufficient preparation for military confrontation. it is a war with an obvious result. the government of prime minister narendra modi should be aware of the pla’s overwhelming firepower and logistics. indian border troops are no rival to pla field forces. if a war spreads, the pla is perfectly capable of annihilating all indian troops in the border region. and that isn’t just bluster. china and india have gone to war over border disputes as recently as the 1960s. the only difference now, is that these nations both have nuclear weapons.

Article 2 - alert- chinese military makes demands
china tells india not ‘to push your luck’ and pull back troops from doklam plateau amid rising tension. china has demanded that india pull back its troops from a contested region high in the himalayas, warning new delhi not “to push your luck” amid a festering border dispute. according to indian officials, about 300 soldiers from either side face each other about 150 metres apart on the doklam plateau, an area also claimed by india’s ally bhutan. what do you think india should do? (comment below) the stand-off began in june when chinese troops started building a road onto the plateau towards india’s border. bhutan sought help from india, which sent troops across the border from the northeastern state of sikkim. comments

Article 3 - analysts: expect attack from chinese military

gerald bull and the chinese super cannon % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) my friends, the events of the last few days have really put me on edge. we have all known that the writings of albert pikewould play out soon, but now we are seeing the first real signs that world war 3 is almost upon us. this week, we discovered china‘s work on directed energy weapons. it has been rumored that the chinese are being feed top-secret technology via russia as a means to counter the americans. the russians have the technology, the chinese have the man-power to make a massive war machine. it all reminds me of an email i received a few years ago. as the story goes, a canadian scientist gerald bull was recruited by saddam hussein to build a long range ballistic weapon that would shoot massive payloads into the sky. just prior to the first gulf war, dr. bull was assassinated. to this day, no one knows exactly who is responsible, but most believe it was saddam hussein. that is where the story takes a strange turn. according to my source, dr. bull’s project was never finished and that he had bowed out so saddam had him assassinated to keep the information secret. then a frightening statement from my source. “saddam sold it to the chinese”. apparently, to counter the us space weapons push, the chinese developed an emp type

Article 1 - pakistan shoots down indian drone 'trespassing' into kashmir
islamabad (ap) — pakistan's military announced saturday that it has shot down a small indian drone after it allegedly trespassed into the country's part of kashmir amid daylong cross-border firing that killed four villagers, including two sisters and their brother. the drone, named ""quad copter"", was targeted after it intruded 60 meters inside pakistan along the line of control in the disputed himalayan region of kashmir, the army spokesman lt. gen. asim saleem bajwa said. his statement added that the drone fell near a pakistani post and troops seized it. there was no immediate comment from the indian army. the latest development came after police said the cross-border firing had killed four villagers. mohammad shafqat , a police official from pakistan's part of kashmir, said three members of a family were among those four people who were killed on saturday. a fourth person who was critically wounded this week died at a hospital, he said. pakistan's army also confirmed the account, saying its troops were returning fire and were carrying out a ""befitting response"" after coming under attack. however, an indian army officer blamed pakistan for initiating the firing, and also described the indian troops' response as ""befitting"". the officer spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief reporters. although such shootouts are common, the latest came a day after pakistan's navy said it had intercepted indian submarines entering the country

Article 2 - 3 indian soldiers are killed in kashmir
new delhi — three indian army soldiers were killed on tuesday on the border between india and pakistan, the army said in a statement, which promised retribution for “this cowardly act.” the body of one soldier had been mutilated, it said. though the army offered no specifics, mutilation in the past has referred to a beheading. it was the second time in recent weeks that a serviceman’s body had been found in that state. in 2013, a few indian soldiers were found beheaded in the area, the disputed border region of kashmir. the encounter on tuesday took place around midday in kupwara, a district in indian-administered kashmir. advertisement continue reading the main story the area is hilly and heavily forested, and the conditions on tuesday were foggy and very cold, brig. p. s. gotra of the indian army’s northern command said by phone. brigadier gotra said it was not clear whether the soldiers had been killed by infiltrating militants, pakistani army troops or a combination of the two.

Article 3 - guns fall silent, but tensions high between india, pakistan
new delhi (ap) — an uneasy calm has fallen over the de facto border between the indian and pakistani-controlled portions of kashmir after months of deadly firing and signs that the two countries were engaged in a brinkmanship not seen for decades. though guns have gone silent for the past five days, analysts say the two nuclear-armed neighbors have displayed unprecedented aggression this year without pursuing any real lines of diplomacy. they've amped up the artillery they've used and targeted infrastructure instead of just military outposts. the corpses of soldiers killed in battle have been found mutilated. ""the level of retaliation was definitely more intense than what india has done in the past,"" said defense analyst c. uday bhaskar of the new delhi-based think tank society for policy studies. ""there is a danger of it spiraling out of control,"" bhaskar said. ""if both sides decide that neither side will blink, then the collateral damage will only increase."" that could also mean recalling diplomats, halting the buses ferrying people back and forth across the border, or stopping all trade. in 2015, bilateral trade amounted to just $2.6 billion — far below the $10.9 billion indian government economists say is possible under normal relations. india and pakistan have long been foes, fighting two of their three wars over their rival claims to the himalayan region of kashmir. countless rounds of peace talks have yielded scant results. the two sides reached a cease

Article 5 - 2 militants, 3 indian security personnel killed in kashmir
srinagar, india (ap) — rebels fighting against indian rule in kashmir ambushed a police patrol on friday, killing two officers, while two militants and an indian soldier died in a separate gunfight in the disputed region, police said. a police officer said rebels fired automatic weapons at the police patrol in southern kulgam town. the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with department policy, said two policemen were killed and another was critically wounded. government forces cordoned off the area to hunt for the attackers, he said. also friday, soldiers and counterinsurgency police raided naidkhai village on a tip and engaged militants in a gunbattle in which two militants and a soldier died, officials said. col. rajesh kalia, an indian army spokesman, said two automatic rifles and ammunition were recovered from the village. after the clash, hundreds of villagers took to the streets to protest against indian rule, chanting slogans like ""we want freedom"" and ""go india, go back."" the villagers demanded that police the return of the bodies of the two militants for burial. tensions have risen sharply along the highly militarized line of control that divides kashmir between nuclear-armed rivals india and pakistan. government forces took extra security measures as authorities allowed friday prayers for the first time in more than four months at the main mosque, jamia masjid, in downtown srinagar city. authorities sealed neighborhoods in downtown srinagar to stop large crowds from gathering

Article 6 - where smugglers once roamed, toothpaste hardly squeezes through
for the first time, pakistan sent a large number of troops into the tribal areas, particularly along a 25-mile stretch across from tora bora in the white mountains. while the primary reason was to block exits for mr. bin laden, analysts said the deployment may provide pakistan with the chance to finally assert control over the lawless frontier. ''the government may want to use this particular opportunity to consolidate the administrative control over this area, which has defied governments since the british,'' said dr. rifaat hussain, chairman of defense studies at quaid-i-azam university in islamabad, pakistan. ''i think the government would like to take maximum advantage of the chance.'' the region's independent nature is obvious from a sign at the western edge of hayatabad warning that no foreigners are allowed to proceed. a policeman lounging nearby wagged a finger and said: ''pakistani police cannot protect you there. you are on your own.'' the government itself had to negotiate with tribal leaders before its soldiers could be sent in. there were reports that some leaders were paid large sums for permission, something the government denies. people in this chaotic bazaar straddling the grand trunk road described watching pakistani troop convoys headed west each of the last three nights. some soldiers cradled rocket-propelled grenade launchers and other heavy weapons, they said. authorities said soldiers are patrolling the rugged mountains and arid valleys on foot, on horseback in off-road

In various articles, several individuals and groups have expressed their views on faith, politics, and social issues. 

Mayor Mrs. Risher of Ingles, Florida, has been in international news for banning Satan from her town's limits through a mayoral proclamation. She claims to have received a divine message to do so.

Rick Warren, a megachurch pastor, discussed cultural and political issues on ABC's ""This Week."" He expressed concerns about the Obama administration's birth control mandate and stated that faith should guide politics, not separate them.

Jeb Bush, a Catholic, has been guided by his faith as a public leader. As governor, he established a faith-based prison to reduce criminal behavior. He believes that one's faith is who they are and should inform their actions.

Paul DeVries wrote about ""clerical errors"" in the Bible, citing examples like Gideon, who was called a mighty warrior despite being inexperienced. DeVries argues that these stories demonstrate divine power in prophetic words.

Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, faced controversy for opposing Donald Trump during his campaign. Many Southern Baptists supported Trump, and Moore's views were seen as out of touch with the party.

Benham brothers, pro-life activists and conservative Christians, suggested that hurricanes striking the US are a message from God to restore boundaries on gender and sexuality. They claimed that America has lost its way and needs to repent.

Article 1 - florida town finds satan an offense unto it
so mrs. risher, the mayor in this town of 1,400 residents for as long as many people can remember, sent him on down the road. she has made international news by banning satan, by mayoral proclamation, from the inglis city limits. she has drawn praise and condemnation and has become the butt of jokes. ''it doesn't bother me,'' she said, ''either way.'' to some people, it is a most heinous violation of the separation of church and state. to others, there was too much separation there already, and it took mrs. risher, a 61-year-old from florida's gulf coast, to pinch church and state together again. mrs. risher, who is known to drive a wrecker for her husband's towing business when she is not handling city business, did not plan on any of that. ''i did what was best for my town and my people,'' mrs. risher said. she did it, she said, because on a late night more than four months ago, god told her to. inglis, about 75 miles north of tampa, was in the grip of what could only be surmised by religious leaders here as satan. to an outsider, cruising down this open stretch of u.s. 19, it would not have looked that way. it would have looked as it always does, slow, a little sleepy, a place where tall, slim palms

Article 2 - rick warren talks about tim tebow, mormons, gay marriage and exclusivity of christ
in an easter sunday interview on abc's ""this week,"" megachurch pastor and best-selling author rick warren talked about a range of cultural and political issues, including president obama's birth control mandate, the intersection of religion and politics and whether one can get to heaven by being a good person. host jake tapper noted that warren has been an outspoken critic of the obama administration's decision to require employers to provide insurance coverage of free birth control without a broad religious exemption. in a february speech, obama offered what he considered an accommodation. religious employers with objections would not have to provide the coverage, but their employees must be offered the coverage at no additional charge by the insurance company. warren said that his concerns were not satisfied by this change. ""the issue here is not about women's health,"" warren explained. ""there is a greater principle and that is, do you have a right to decide what your faith practices. now, i don't have a problem with contraception. i'm a protestant, i'm an evangelical. but i do support my catholic brothers and sisters to believe what they want to believe."" warren also said that he believes in the separation of church and state, but does not believe in the separation of faith and politics. faith is ""simply a worldview,"" warren explained. and, since everyone has a worldview, those who have a religious worldview should not be excluded from politics. ""of course, everybody's

Article 3 - jeb bush, 20 years after conversion, is guided by his catholic faith
“as a public leader, one’s faith should guide you,” mr. bush said in italy in 2009, explaining his attitude about the relationship between religion and politics at a conference associated with communion and liberation, a conservative catholic lay movement. “in the united states, many people think you need to keep your faith, put it in a security box, if you’re an elected official — put it in a safety deposit box until you finish your service as a public servant and then you can go get it back,” he added. “i never felt that was appropriate.” like his brother george w. bush, who established the white house office on faith-based initiatives, jeb bush was a champion of religion-based social services. as governor, he established what he said was the nation’s first faith-based prison, encouraging religious activity — of any faith tradition — in an effort to reduce criminal behavior. and he has said his religious beliefs helped inform his concern about child welfare and other issues. “you hear people say, ‘i don’t want to impose my faith,’ ” mr. bush told the newspaper the florida catholic days after leaving office in 2007. “well, it’s not an imposition of faith. it’s who you are.” the son and brother of protestant presidents, mr. bush, if elected, would be the nation’s second catholic president. sometimes, he carries a rosary in his pocket and fingers its beads at moments of crisis. he is a member

Article 4 - the bible's prophetic calling and why i am a 'clerical error'
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. we have all had clerical errors, whether in making an order online or buying in a store. sometimes others make the errors. sometimes we make them ourselves. in each case, people want to know: in whose favor was this error? who benefitted? who lost? and how should the error be fixed? who i am today is the result of a huge ""clerical error"" – where nobody lost, but many gained. expand | collapse (by cp cartoonist rod anderson) paul de vries is an exclusive cp columnist. there are great biblical models of clerical errors that demonstrate the potential divine power of prophetic words that may seem out of place. how fascinating it is to read the historic stories of very humble people who are given high praise and encouragement – even before they accomplish the great deeds for which god is calling them. only later in the bible story do they accomplish the work that is then worthy of the praise they had prophetically received already. for example, consider gideon. when the lord's angel first encounters him, he calls gideon a ""mighty warrior,"" which he certainly was not! at that moment gideon was futilely trying to thrash wheat indoors, while hiding in a winepress building (judges 6:11-12). it was as if the angels' record-keeping had a major clerical error. however, by

Article 5 - russell moore controversy shows evangelical leaders lack courage
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. (photo: courtesy of sbc/adam covington) russell moore, president of the ethics & religious liberty commission, gives the entity's report during the annual meeting of the southern baptist convention on wednesday, st, louis, missouri, on june 15, 2016. do christians want leaders or lemmings? the recent controversy concerning russell moore, president of the ethics and religious liberty commission (erlc) of the southern baptist convention (sbc), suggests we'd prefer the latter. expand | collapse julie roys is host of a national talk show on the moody radio network called ""up for debate.” moore is in hot water because he opposed donald trump during the campaign, accusing trump of lacking a ""moral compass,"" inciting racial division, and harboring an attitude toward women like that of ""a bronze age warlord."" this didn't sit well with many southern baptists, who largely supported trump. exit polls showed a walloping 80% of evangelicals voted for trump, many of whom, i'm sure, are southern baptists. in addition, some very prominent southern baptist pastors stumped for trump, including arkansas governor mike huckabee and pastor robert jeffress of first baptist dallas, a church with a congregation of 12,000. now,

Article 6 - unmasking magic and murder in the best new crime

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

In various articles, several individuals and groups have expressed their views on faith, politics, and social issues. 

Mayor Mrs. Risher of Ingles, Florida, has been in international news for banning Satan from her town's limits through a mayoral proclamation. She claims to have received a divine message to do so.

Rick Warren, a megachurch pastor, discussed cultural and political issues on ABC's ""This Week."" He expressed concerns about the Obama administration's birth control mandate and stated that faith should guide politics, not separate them.

Jeb Bush, a Catholic, has been guided by his faith as a public leader. As governor, he established a faith-based prison to reduce criminal behavior. He believes that one's faith is who they are and should inform their actions.

Paul DeVries wrote about ""clerical errors"" in the Bible, citing examples like Gideon, who was called a mighty warrior despite being inexperienced. DeVries argues that these stories demonstrate divine power in prophetic words.

Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, faced controversy for opposing Donald Trump during his campaign. Many Southern Baptists supported Trump, and Moore's views were seen as out of touch with the party.

Benham brothers, pro-life activists and conservative Christians, suggested that hurricanes striking the US are a message from God to restore boundaries on gender and sexuality. They claimed that America has lost its way and needs to repent

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
After analyzing the provided articles, it appears that they are all variations of a single question: ""If Satan is as great as he thinks he is, then why does he pretend to be Jesus in the time of Jacob's trouble?""

There is no concrete information or facts presented in these articles. The articles seem to be rhetorical questions with no clear answers or supporting evidence.

The repetition of the same question across multiple articles suggests that it may be a thought experiment or a philosophical discussion rather than an attempt to present factual information.

No specific topics, events, or themes are discussed beyond the central question. There is also no apparent connection between the articles and any external sources or references.

In summary, these articles appear to be a series of rhetorical questions with no clear facts or supporting evidence presented.

The article discusses why people love the Olympics, citing examples of athletes' passion for the games, and explores various reasons behind this phenomenon, such as the infrequency of Olympic events and the high stakes involved in competition. There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made by the article are supported by the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. The only discrepancy is that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY does not mention specific athletes like Andy Murray, Victoria Azarenka, or Usain Bolt, but this can be attributed to the fact that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY appears to focus on a different set of topics and events (e.g., Winter Olympics, corruption issues).","Here's a concise summary of the articles, focusing on facts:

**Olympics and Body Diversity**

The Olympics showcased a range of body types, celebrating every one of them for their abilities. This shift in focus helped people feel good about their own bodies, breaking away from traditional beauty standards.

**Spanish Athlete Sets Example of Kindness and Sportsmanship**

Spanish athlete Ivan Fernandez Anaya allowed Kenyan runner Abel Mutai to finish first despite his mistake during the 2013 Burlada Cross Race. Anaya encouraged Mutai to continue running and cross the finish line.

**Allyson Felix's Journey to Gold**

American track and field athlete Allyson Felix is determined to land gold in the 200m event at the upcoming Olympics, citing ""motivation"" as her definition of silver. She has spent four years training for this moment.

**US Women's Field Hockey Team Prepares for Rio**

The US women's field hockey team will compete in their sixth Olympic appearance, seeking their second medal. The team finished fourth at the 2014 World Cup and is currently ranked fifth in the world.

**Brazil and Canada Fight to Tie in Pan Am Games**

In a recent water polo match at the Pan Am Games, Brazil and Canada fought to tie, with no clear winner announced.

**Tennis Offers Many Physical Benefits**

Engaging in tennis can offer numerous physical benefits, including cardiovascular benefits, muscle strength, bone health, and increased flexibility. Studies have shown that playing tennis early in life can lead to a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease.

**Illinois Lawsuit Settled Over Disabled Student Athletes**

A settlement was reached between the Illinois High School Association and disabled student athlete Mary Kate Callahan, allowing her to compete in swimming, diving, and track and field events.","The Winter Olympics are set to take place in Salt Lake City, with a focus on security and corruption issues. The games will be the first under Jacques Rogge's leadership, following Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure. Corruption led to the indictment of two officials and changes in IOC procedures.

Rhythmic gymnast Wang performed well at the World Championships but fell short of qualifying for the Olympics. She lost her balance during one event, resulting in a 0.4-point deduction.

The Olympics showcase diverse narratives, with athletes from different countries experiencing unique moments. Cathy Freeman's gold medal win and Michael Johnson's consecutive Olympic titles are notable examples.

Lolo Jones is under investigation for an alleged bar fight in Lake Placid, New York. The USBSF is investigating the incident, which may be a code of conduct violation.

NBC is promoting the Olympics with a more edgy tone, focusing on athletes' personalities and rivalries. Promos highlight speedskater Apolo Anton Ohno and mogul skier Jonny Moseley's ""rebel streaks.""

Britain invested heavily in summer Olympic sports, spending $47,000 to $79,000 per athlete on coaching and training. Each medal won by Britain has cost over $6.5 million.

China's Olympic success comes with a heavy burden, as athletes often face injuries, poverty, and unemployment after their careers end. The country's draconian sports system can produce damaged goods, and some athletes are cast aside after their careers.

Article 1 - next stop, salt lake city
now that the super bowl is over, the eclectic assortment of snow and ice-based sporting events known as the winter olympics will soon be in high gear in salt lake city and the wasatch range that towers over that western metropolis. it will probably seem to many viewers -- especially those who remember when the summer and winter games were played back to back once every four years -- as though the sydney olympics just ended. actually, a lot has changed since sydney. the salt lake city games were planned under juan antonio samaranch, the longtime president of the international olympic committee, but they will be played under his successor, jacques rogge, who brings a less regal, more human demeanor to the job. one of the inevitable subtexts of these games will be the corruption that afflicted the selection process and led to the indictment of two members of the salt lake organizing committee. it also led to a change in i.o.c. procedures and the replacement of 10 i.o.c. members. the charges against the two salt lake city officials have been dismissed, but the corruption on the i.o.c. was real, and it was pandered to in salt lake city. another subtext will, of course, be the question of security. salt lake city has faced the extraordinary task of reinventing security procedures in the few months since sept. 11, bringing them up to a standard that will protect and reassure everyone, athletes and spectators alike

Article 2 - top rhythmic gymnast sees dreams of beijing fade away
“when people are little, they say, ‘i want to be a firefighter’ or ‘i want to be a ballerina,’” wang said last week in a telephone interview after practice. “i always wanted to go to the olympics.” rhythmic gymnastics is relatively obscure in the united states, but in europe and south america, it is extremely popular. the olympic qualifier is one event — the world championships. of the 128 athletes who competed in september, 24 made it to the final (only two competitors from each country can advance). the top 20 qualified for the olympics. at the world championships, wang’s best event, the hoop, was first. “you’re a lot more nervous for your first event,” she said. “i knew that would be a disadvantage for me.” on one move in her hoop routine, wang lost her balance and touched her hand to the mat — an automatic 0.4-point deduction. in the preliminary round, her lowest score in the four events would be dropped, giving wang a chance to qualify for the final. there, she could start with a clean slate. she performed her rope, clubs and ribbon routines without major mistakes, but she received scores lower than her average at international competitions throughout the year. even dropping her hoop score, she finished 28th (31st counting competitors who were ineligible to advance), 0.35 of a point from qualifying for the final. photo “it was

Article 3 - olympian narratives
race walking provided the most riveting olympic moment for television viewers in mexico. danes were mesmerized by badminton, south koreans by their men's field hockey team. chinese and swedish fans watched an epic battle between two longtime rivals for table-tennis gold. in the netherlands, these olympics were mostly about swimming. in cameroon, they were about soccer. the olympic games, it is easy to forget, are no monolith. because it is human nature to cheer our own, the olympics are experienced, and ultimately remembered, in different ways in different places. but the narratives all share a common theme, one of athletic prowess and determination overcoming the surrounding clutter -- the politics of the olympic bureaucracy, the cynicism, the specter of performance-enhancing drugs, the complaints about saccharine broadcasting and all the rest. to be sure, there are some global olympic memories too, moments awe-inspiring enough to transcend parochialism and pull in all the separate narratives: cathy freeman, the australian and aboriginal sprinter, winning gold in the 400-meter race and carrying both her national and ethnic flag on her victory lap; michael johnson becoming the first man to win the 400-meter sprint in consecutive olympics; china's fu mingxia becoming only the third diver to win four olympic gold medals. then there was the heartbreak of the russian gymnast sv

Article 4 - lolo jones under investigation for alleged bar fight?
lolo jones, the 30-year-old olympic hurdler and bobsledding athlete, may have recently been involved in a bar fight in lake placid, n.y. the christian athlete reportedly got into a physical altercation with the stepdaughter of tony carlino, an athlete turned manager of the olympic sports complex in lake placid, according to former olympic swimmer amy van dyken. dyken first reported the news on her fox sports tonight radio show. while details are still emerging about jones' alleged physical altercation, usa bobsled & skeleton federation is looking into the matter.

Article 6 - britain’s huge investment in summer olympic sports pays off
u.k. sport also gives leading athletes support worth about $47,000 to about $79,000, which is spent on coaching and training. each medal that britain won in rio has cost, on average, more than $6.5 million. britain not only has spent huge amounts on achieving olympic success but also has been meticulous in how the funding is used. “what makes the difference is the amount of money, but also the way in which it is managed, targeted and ruthlessly audited and accounted for,” said borja garcía, a senior lecturer in sport management and policy at loughborough university in england. photo u.k. sport uses what it has called a no-compromise approach, prioritizing sports in which britain has good prospects of winning medals. and in sports like cycling and rowing, success has become self-perpetuating: each successful games results in a further uptick in funding, leaving britain in a position to win more medals at the next olympics. the investment not only targets sports that offer the best medal prospects but also those sports that offer the most medals, garcía said. sports that do not offer good prospects have had their funding cut or, in the case of basketball and volleyball for this year’s games, removed altogether. the funding has helped britain be at the cutting edge of developments in sports science and psychology, technology, coaching and talent identification. the best example of this is in cycling

Article 7 - heavy burden on athletes takes joy away from china’s olympic success
by any measure, this should be a season of unvarnished celebration for china. it has pulled slightly ahead of the united states in the battle for medals, and the games have produced a new national hero in sun yang, the first chinese man to win an olympic gold in swimming. but in recent days, a tide of self-doubt and introspection about the human costs of china’s olympic prowess has arisen amid worries that the nation’s draconian sports system is sometimes producing damaged goods. floundering athletes can even be cast aside after their careers are over — a point driven home last year when a former gold medal gymnast was found begging on the streets of beijing. according to the state media, 240,000 retired athletes are grappling with injuries, poverty and unemployment. sometimes the victors inadvertently reveal the sacrifices they were forced to endure during their years of training. last week, shortly after winning her third olympic gold medal, the chinese diver wu minxia was told that her grandparents had died years earlier and that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer. ms. wu’s father explained that the family preferred to lie to his daughter all those years rather than risk harming her olympic prospects. “we accepted a long time ago that she doesn’t belong to us,” the father, wu yuming, told a shanghai newspaper. “i don’t even dare think about things like enjoying family happiness.” like many chinese athletes, ms

Content: why we love the olympics (before it's news) while i was watching the united states battle croatia in the quarterfinals of the men’s water polo tournament, a thought came into my mind, “why are people around the world so fond of the olympics?” of course we enjoy watching the best in the world compete in sports that we see everyday on television, like tennis and basketball; but why do we drool and wait in anticipation over the results of the judo events or the archery competitions? why over a two and a half week period am i going on my phone every hour to see who won the most recent handball match? i began to think, “would i ever dare skip out on going outside and enjoying the summer just to watch water polo if this weren’t the olympics?” nothing against water polo, and how much respect i have for the men and women who play the grueling sport, but the answer to that question is a definitive no! although it may seem that crazy fans like myself are the only ones that have this over the top obsession with the olympics, the athletes who compete also feel an unparalleled passion for the games. in tennis, andy murray and victoria azarenka competed in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, which is something that the top players never do, even at majors. rafael nadal said missing out on the olympics was one of the saddest moments of his career. lebron james, who finished his nba season in late june, refused to take a summer break after his long playoff run because he wanted to play for team usa. tons of athletes have shown their love of the games by getting the olympic rings tattooed on their body such as swimmers michael phelps, ryan lochte, and matthew grevers. what is it that makes the olympics so different, so irresistible? first, people love the olympics because they don’t occur every year. in sports, and in life, the less frequently something happens, the more interested people are when something does happen. for example, people are enamored by perfect games and no-hitters because they don’t occur everyday; instead, they are truly rare feats. while an mlb player may have over 20 shots at a title, olympians usually only have two or three chances at a gold medal. people are captivated by the aspect that usain bolt has one shot at the 100 meters, and if he comes up short, he will have to wait 4 years to get back on the globe’s biggest stage. unlike a player in the nfl or nba, bolt can’t make a mistake and come back the next game, or the next season in hopes of a title. olympians work tirelessly to get on top of the olympic podium, but if they don’t, it’s a long four year journey to

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The Winter Olympics are set to take place in Salt Lake City, with a focus on security and corruption issues. The games will be the first under Jacques Rogge's leadership, following Juan Antonio Samaranch's tenure. Corruption led to the indictment of two officials and changes in IOC procedures.

Rhythmic gymnast Wang performed well at the World Championships but fell short of qualifying for the Olympics. She lost her balance during one event, resulting in a 0.4-point deduction.

The Olympics showcase diverse narratives, with athletes from different countries experiencing unique moments. Cathy Freeman's gold medal win and Michael Johnson's consecutive Olympic titles are notable examples.

Lolo Jones is under investigation for an alleged bar fight in Lake Placid, New York. The USBSF is investigating the incident, which may be a code of conduct violation.

Here's a concise summary of the facts:

**Politics**

* Trump quits the Paris Climate Accord, citing sovereignty concerns.
* The ""Pledge for America"" released by GOP lawmakers in Virginia is seen as a bait-and-switch, with promises not being fulfilled.
* Medicare is heading towards insolvency, with potential tax increases proposed to save it.

**Healthcare**

* A health insurance solution proposed by some states could involve experimenting with novel approaches, such as blockchain-based systems.
* The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to concerns about the power of unelected bureaucrats in making healthcare decisions.
* Hospitals are feeling the effects of value-based purchasing and readmission rewards and penalties.

**National Security**

* The US government is spending more than it takes in, leading to national bankruptcy concerns.
* Each American owes an average of $42,000 towards federal debt.

**Economy**

* A simplistic tax plan proposed by Trump's team could be seen as a good starting point for reforming the tax code.
* Romney's healthcare plan has been criticized for its potential impact on quality of care and the federal budget deficit.","The articles discuss various aspects of the US healthcare system, including health insurance reform, hospital fees, and patient costs. 

In 2009, President Obama held a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, where he discussed the need for health care reform to address issues with insurance companies denying coverage or charging high fees.

Hospitals in New Hampshire agreed to lower their fees for uninsured patients, with some hospitals providing charity care worth $1.7 billion annually. However, critics argue that hospitals often fail to inform patients of available financial aid and may refuse to provide it.

The ""public option"" is being re-examined as a potential solution to the US healthcare system. The concept involves government-run health insurance plans, which could provide lower-cost coverage than private insurers.

Specialty hospitals are booming in Indianapolis, but experts warn that this growth may create excess demand for treatment rather than improve clinical quality. Medicare payments have also led to an increase in specialty hospital construction.

The American Health Care Act would convert Medicaid to a block grant, straining the safety net and leaving millions without coverage. Experts argue that this plan is unprecedented in its intention to reduce coverage.

Letters to the editor discuss the challenges of providing universal healthcare, with some arguing that proposals should focus on reducing costs rather than increasing access.

New regulations require health insurers to justify rate increases over 10 percent, while insurance companies defend their shift towards Medicare-based rates as necessary to control costs. However, critics argue that this change leaves patients more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills.

Overall, the articles highlight the complexities and challenges of the US healthcare system, including issues with insurance reform, hospital fees, and patient costs.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name=None, diversity_type=None, verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 3 - the truth about medicare
the truth about medicare (before it's news) medicare is heading toward insolvency and that will happen no matter who is elected president if action is not taken to save the program and soon. socialist president obama will propose tax increases on all concerned, particularly the “rich”, that he defines as families and businesses earning more than $$250,000 a year, to save medicare because tax increases are always the solution for socialists, rather than tough decisions. romney/ryan will propose long term solutions to save medicare for future generations. obama cut more than $$700 billion out of medicare to help pay for obamacare to provide medical insurance for obama’s peep’s; those on the dole, those that pay no income taxes at all and eventually for illegal aliens. cutting that money from medicare will result in lower payments to doctors and hospitals, which will result in fewer doctors willing to take medicare. it is already happening, which is the reason congress must step in every year to enact the “doc fix” to restore higher payments. however, if these cuts really do happen, this will lead to rationing of medical care for senior citizens and the infamous death panels in obamacare. in addition, cutting that $$700 billion from medicare will result in eliminating the medicare advantage hmo program, which will negatively impact 22 million, mostly lower income senior citizens, that will lose this great program. once gone, these seniors will experience much higher cost

a health insurance solution that some smart state should try % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the term “united states” is both plural (many states united) and singular (the united states). the tag line “e pluribus unum” loses its meaning if we cease to be many, if we give up our identities as individual states. as states, we are as different from each other as the united states is from canada. the united states are most powerful pursuing opportunities and fixing problems in the plural but defending in the singular. justice louis brandeis called the states “laboratories” for policy experiments. it is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. when massachusetts experimented on itself with romneycare, it was behaving in complete accord with the wishes of the founders. that’s exactly what federalism means. for the past fifty years, though, most states have looked to washington to pursue every opportunity, solve every problem, and fund every initiative. missouri wants to change its schools, its republican legislature begs arne duncan for cash—offering our sovereignty in return. (just one example.) if some enterprising state would like to experiment with health insurance that actually solves some problems rather than

Article 5 - the biggest threat to national security
the biggest threat to national security % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by jacob hornberger published 10/08/10 everyone is finally starting to recognize that the federal government is merrily traveling down the road to national bankruptcy … and is going to take a lot of americans down with it. the government is spending at least $$1 trillion dollars more than what it is taking in … every year, with no end in sight. everyone knows what happens when people do that on a personal or family basis. if you’re already deeply in debt and you keep spending lots more than what you’re bringing in, there can be only one result at the end of the road — bankruptcy. well, guess what. in case you haven’t noticed, the federal government is already deeply in debt. in fact, each american, including children, owes an average of some $$42,000, which is each person’s share of the federal debt. for a family of four, that amounts to $$168,000. care to pay up your family’s share? alas, most americans say, “well, i’m not going to worry about that. that’s a problem for my elected representatives to work out.” that’s a foolhardy attitude. why? because contrary to what you were taught in those government schools, public officials don’t look out for your interests; they look out for their own interests. every american needs to

Article 6 - kaine’s healthcare law gives 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide the healthcare decisions for virginians
kaine’s healthcare law gives 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide the healthcare decisions for virginians (before it's news) with two-year anniversary approaching, the consequences of tim kaine’s healthcare law when former democrat national committee (dnc) chairman tim kaine helped make president barack obama’s intrusive healthcare bill the law of the land, we knew it would force every virginian to purchase health insurance, but now we are learning that it will give 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide which healthcare decisions are best for virginians. in fact, the american hospital association, along with over 70 medical groups warned the democrat leadership – which included nancy pelosi, harry reid and chairman kaine – that the independent payment advisory board (ipab) could limit seniors’ access to medicare and even the infrastructure for the entire healthcare system. additionally, it’s been reported that the ipab’s true end game is to arbitrarily control the price of healthcare and decide what type of medical treatments patients in virginia can receive. as the wall street journal reports: public opposition to the affordable care act has grown in surprising and unpredictable ways since the entitlement passed two years ago, but few would have predicted then that so many democrats would repudiate so many of president obama’s core promises. yet that is happening now, as congress targets the 15-member central committee that is supposed to control health costs. … this turn is remarkable because the ipab really does

romney wins on style but pay attention to health care people (before it's news) there is no doubt that romney won style points last night. he was energized. the president looked tired. romney sort of faked smile. the president more or less smirked. but that should not effect voting. the issues should. in my role here, i only want what is best for people to lead better quality lives and healthier lives. there is a lot right with health reform and with the market forces that were in place before the affordable care act. just two days ago, hospitals started feeling the effects of getting paid for outcomes and quality with value-based purchasing and readmission rewards and penalties kicking in. there is one trillion dollars in healthcare waste, fraud and abuse so reducing medicare by $$750+ billion is not going to affect quality of care. many hospitals have already been operating to medicare rates in anticipation. providers can well afford it when you take into consideration their huge margins and high executive salaries. does romney forget that he implemented obama care in ma? the nonpartisan congressional budget office came out this summer with the costs of repealing the affordable care act. according to the cbo, it would increase the federal budget deficit by an estimated $$109 billion between 2013 and 2022. and let’s not forget our responsibility. two-thirds of medicare spending is used for people with five or more chronic conditions. we are a nation that takes it for granted

Article 1 - obama’s health care town hall in portsmouth
now, i want to thank more than anybody, lori, for that introduction, and for sharing her story with the rest of us. (applause.) thank you, lori. lori's story is the same kind of story that i've read in letters, that i've heard in town hall meetings just like this one for the past five years. in fact, some of you were in that town hall -- those town hall meetings, as i was traveling all throughout new hampshire. it's the story of hardworking americans who are held hostage by health insurance companies that deny them coverage, or drop their coverage, or charge fees that they can't afford for care that they desperately need. i believe it is wrong. it is bankrupting families and businesses, and that's why we are going to pass health insurance reform in 2009. (applause.) now, this is obviously a tough time for families here in new hampshire and all across america. six months ago, we were in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes. i want you to remember what things were like in january and february. we were losing about 700,000 jobs per month. and economists of all stripes feared a second-coming of the great depression. that was only six months ago. that's why we acted as fast as we could to pass a recovery act that would stop the freefall. and i want to make sure everybody understands what we did

Article 2 - hospitals agree to lower fees for uninsured
the only patients who are truly charged the full prices are the uninsured, who are usually poor. that practice has attracted intense criticism in the last year from advocates for consumers and the poor. the new policy by the healthcare association, which represents the state's 220 hospitals, was adopted two weeks ago and first reported yesterday in the wall street journal. hospitals do provide charity care, to varying degrees; the industry estimates that statewide it swallows about $1.7 billion a year in unpaid bills, mostly for indigent patients. but a recent report by citizen action, a liberal advocacy group, said that hospitals often fail to inform patients of the availability of financial aid. in a separate study, the legal aid society concluded that some hospitals simply refuse to make aid available, pursuing repayment even from patients who have no ability to pay. in their defense, hospital officials have long argued that under federal regulations, because medicare rates are discounted based on the full, or ''customary,'' prices, hospitals are required to charge those high retail prices to uninsured patients. but the new policy would appear to contradict that understanding of federal policy, stating that hospitals should give discounts to uninsured patients with family incomes of less than double the federal poverty level, so that their bills are no higher than what insurers pay. daniel sisto, president of the healthcare association of new york state, said he could not be sure that the policy would be accepted by washington. ''we are basically proceeding on the presumption that the government's

Article 3 - the health care ‘public option’ is back. can it help obamacare?
margot: i didn’t cover the public option back in 2009, so i’ve been trying to get caught up. i’ve learned that when advocates talk about the public option, they don’t all mean the same thing. basically, “public option” means government-run. but there are a few versions that get talked about: one is something like a medicare expansion, where younger people can buy into the existing public program. one is just a new insurance plan, structured like its competitors, that is run by the government. another is some sort of hybrid, where the insurance company might be separate from medicare, but might have the ability to force doctors to accept low, set prices. the common thread appears to be the idea that the government, which lacks a profit motive, will be able to provide lower-cost, higher-quality health insurance than the private companies. am i missing anything? reed: it does sound suspiciously like the reasoning behind the co-ops. the structure depends on what you want to achieve — is this a plan that is basically a fallback option? or are you trying to use the government’s negotiating clout to introduce lower-cost plans? a public option could also be a way to stabilize the exchanges because a government-run plan could be used to enroll the people with the most expensive medical conditions. the private insurers would be more enthusiastic about selling policies because they might have to worry less about losses. photo linda blumberg, one of the authors

Article 4 - generous medicare payments spur specialty hospital boom
amid the building boom here in indianapolis, some hospitals are laying off employees or scaling back programs, like psychiatric care, that are less generously reimbursed. preventive care and case management, health experts add, get short shrift. ''the incentives are terribly misaligned,'' said samuel r. nussbaum, a doctor and former hospital executive who is now the chief medical officer of anthem, a large health insurer here. creating excess demand a study of indianapolis health care last year concluded that the construction of so many new heart hospitals could create excess demand for treatment rather than produce better cardiac care. ''improving clinical quality did not appear to be a driving force for new facilities or services,'' said the report, by the center for studying health system change, a nonprofit research group. ''given these market conditions, provider competition could, alternatively, result in higher use rates and costs.'' in washington, lawmakers rushing to complete a compromise bill that would establish a medicare prescription drug benefit are now turning their attention to the growth of specialty hospitals. the senate version of the medicare bill would make it harder for doctors to invest in and refer patients to such hospitals, and full-service hospitals are lobbying hard for the provision. hospitals will typically not disclose how much they profit from a particular procedure, like a coronary bypass or angioplasty. and medicare -- with little information about the cost of treatment -- cannot say, either. but one full-service medical center that is leading the lobbying campaign against specialty

Article 5 - what’s at stake in a health bill that slashes the safety net
mr. ryan’s proposal, the american health care act, doesn’t merely undo the expansion of medicaid to the near poor. it converts the entire program into a block grant to the states and gradually strangles it by increasing federal funding more slowly than projected spending growth. not even the clinton administration’s welfare reform of 1996, the other notable revision of the american safety net, proposed such a redistribution. welfare reform did hurt many poor people by converting antipoverty funds into block grants to the states. but it was accompanied by a big increase in the earned-income tax credit, the nation’s most effective antipoverty tool today. more than reducing antipoverty funds, the strategy for welfare reform changed who got them and under what conditions. the american health care act, by contrast, is decidedly about cutting people off. david m. cutler, an expert on the economics of health care at harvard university, put it like this: “no other congress or administration has ever put forward a plan with the intention of having fewer people covered.” under the house republican plan, 24 million more americans will lack health insurance by 2026, according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office. of those, 14 million will lose access to medicaid and “choose” not to spend money — money they don’t have — on health insurance. millions more near-poor people in their 50s and early 60s will likewise be left without a policy they can

Article 6 - letters: the rich, the poor and health insurance
to the editor: in “why health care will never be equal” (economic view, sept. 20), n. gregory mankiw says the premise that “everyone should have access to the best health care possible whenever they need it” clashes with the reality that “state-of-the-art medicine is expensive.” the analysis misses two points. first, proposals for universal health care don’t assume that joe six-packs will be visiting private concierge doctors or having elective ct scans and the like, the way that today’s über-wealthy do. the rich will continue to enjoy better access to care than the average person; the proposals would simply reduce that huge gulf a bit. second, the cost of health care has gone up dramatically without universal care, and will likely will continue to go up whether or not health care reform passes. other developed countries have dealt with this problem and have found a way to provide universal coverage while spending less than we do in the united states. kenneth krasity beverly hills, mich., sept. 21  to the editor: the column used a hypothetical “dorian gray pill” — guaranteeing immortality, but priced at $150,000 for a year’s supply — to illustrate one quandary of universal health care. advertisement continue reading the main story but suppose the production cost of the pill in a mass market worked out to $150 a person per year. and suppose the pill prevented diabetes or heart disease, rather

Article 7 - health insurers to be required to justify rate increases over 10 percent
the law did not define unreasonable — a gap the administration is now trying to fill. under the rule issued tuesday, insurers seeking increases of 10 percent or more in the individual or small-group market next year must publicly disclose the planned increases and the justifications for them. in recent years, individual and small-group premiums have been rising more than 10 percent a year, on average, and many increases far exceed national measures of medical cost inflation, federal officials said. the 10 percent threshold may change in later years. starting in 2012, the federal government will set a threshold for each state, reflecting trends in its insurance and medical costs. consumer advocates welcomed the rules as a way to hold insurers accountable for skyrocketing premiums. in the last year, they noted, state officials in california and connecticut, among other states, have denied big rate increases sought by some insurers. photo it was not immediately clear whether the rule would help insurers hold down costs. karen m. ignagni, president of america’s health insurance plans, a trade group, said that in their zeal to review premiums, “the administration and congress have largely ignored factors driving up the cost of coverage.” these factors, ms. ignagni said, include the power of doctors and hospitals to negotiate higher reimbursement rates, new benefit mandates and the tendency of younger, healthier people to drop coverage, leaving sicker people in the insurance pool. under the proposed regulation, the federal government will assess each state’s procedures

Article 8 - insurers alter cost formula, and patients pay more
insurance companies defend the shift toward medicare-based rates under the settlement, which allowed any clear, objective method of calculating reimbursement. they say that premiums would be even costlier if reimbursements were more generous, and that exorbitant doctors’ fees are largely to blame. but few dispute that as the nation debates an overhaul aimed at insuring everybody, the new realpolitik of reimbursement is leaving millions of insured families more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills, even though they are paying higher premiums, co-payments and deductibles. “they’re not getting what they think they’re paying for,” said benjamin m. lawsky, the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services, whose investigators recently found that under the switch, 4.7 million new york state residents — 76 percent of those with out-of-network coverage — are facing reimbursement reductions of 50 percent or more. the switch “certainly creates the appearance that insurers are trying to end-run the settlement and keep out-of-network payments low,” mr. lawsky said. mr. lawsky, who worked for mr. cuomo when he was attorney general, is seeking legislation in new york state to require that minimum reimbursements be linked to the new database, known as fair health. in the 2009 settlement, the insurers did not admit wrongdoing. but they paid to set up fair health as a replacement for ingenix, a database owned by the insurance giant united healthcare. mr. cuomo said ingenix

Content: so figuring out how we can say no may be the single toughest and most important task facing the people who will be in charge of carrying out reform. “being able to say no,” dr. alan garber of stanford says, “is the heart of the issue.” it’s easy to come up with arguments for why we need to do so. above all, we don’t have a choice. giving hospitals and drug makers a blank check will bankrupt medicare. slowing the cost growth, on the other hand, will free up resources for other uses, like education. lower costs will also lift workers’ take-home pay. but i suspect that these arguments won’t be persuasive. they have the faint ring of an insurer’s rationale for denying a claim. compared with an anecdote about a cancer patient looking for hope, the economic arguments are soulless. the better bet for the new reformers — starting with donald berwick, the physician who will run medicare — is to channel american culture, not fight it. we want the best possible care, no matter what. yet we often do not get it because the current system tends to deliver more care even when it means worse care. it’s not just ct scans. caesarean births have become more common, with little benefit to babies and significant burden to mothers. men who would never have died from prostate cancer have been treated for it and left incontinent or impotent. cardiac stenting and bypasses, with all their side effects, have become popular partly because people believe they reduce heart attacks. for many patients, the evidence suggests, that’s not true. advocates for less intensive medicine have been too timid about all this. they often come across as bean counters, while the try-anything crowd occupies the moral high ground. the reality, though, is that unnecessary care causes a lot of pain and even death. dr. berwick, who made his reputation campaigning against medical errors, is a promising (if much belated) selection for precisely this reason. can we solve the entire problem of rising health costs by getting rid of needless care? probably not. but the money involved is not trivial, and it’s the obvious place to start. advertisement continue reading the main story • learning to say no more often will be a three-step process, and if the new agencies created by the health act are run well, they can help with all three. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the first is learning more about when treatments work and when they don’t. “all too often,” the institute of medicine reports, the data is “incomplete or unavailable

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The articles discuss various aspects of the US healthcare system, including health insurance reform, hospital fees, and patient costs. 

In 2009, President Obama held a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, where he discussed the need for health care reform to address issues with insurance companies denying coverage or charging high fees.

Hospitals in New Hampshire agreed to lower their fees for uninsured patients, with some hospitals providing charity care worth $1.7 billion annually. However, critics argue that hospitals often fail to inform patients of available financial aid and may refuse to provide it.

The ""public option"" is being re-examined as a potential solution to the US healthcare system. The concept involves government-run health insurance plans, which could provide lower-cost coverage than private insurers.

Specialty hospitals are booming in Indianapolis, but experts warn that this growth may create excess demand for treatment rather than improve clinical quality. Medicare payments have also led to an increase in specialty hospital construction.

The American Health Care Act would convert Medicaid to a block grant, straining the safety net and leaving millions without coverage. Experts argue that this plan is unprecedented in its intention to reduce coverage.

Letters to the editor discuss the challenges of providing universal healthcare, with some arguing that proposals should focus on reducing costs rather than increasing access.

New regulations require health insurers to justify rate increases over 10 percent, while insurance companies defend their shift towards Medicare-based rates as necessary to control costs. However, critics argue that this change leaves patients more vulnerable to catastrophic medical

Article 2 - paris attacks complicate hillary clinton’s alignment with obama
mrs. clinton’s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with mr. obama. mrs. clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to “build on the progress” of the obama administration. in places like south carolina where african-american voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, mrs. clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising mr. obama’s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. in a new york times/cbs news survey released last thursday, 79 percent of democrats said they were satisfied or very satisfied with mr. obama’s presidency, and 60 percent said they would like to see the next president continue his policies. but the renewed emphasis on terrorism in the past few days has laid bare mrs. clinton’s long-held differences with mr. obama on foreign policy and when the united states should intervene in conflicts abroad. for four years as secretary of state, mrs. clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of mr. obama’s first term, often pushing the white house to embrace a more aggressive approach. she urged the administration to join a nato-led coalition to oust col. muammar el-qaddafi in libya, proposed that more forces be left in iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate syrian rebels. “i assume she and her advisers are trying to cal

Article 3 - hillary clinton's policy will mean 'generations of terrorism': donald trump | zee news
follow @zeenews fayetteville (us): donald trump has criticised president barack obama and hillary clinton for dragging the us into wars overseas and said the rival presidential candidate's foreign policy would mean ""generations of terrorism"" into american schools, but his plan would put ""america first"". ""(obama and clinton) have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and they've left our borders wide open at home,"" he said at an election rally in new hampshire. ""isn't it interesting how we fight for other people's borders, lose the lives, the money - most important are the lives, the great lives. we lose lives, the money, and yet we want to have open borders, right? explain that,"" he said. ""we fight for borders for other countries - half the people never heard of these other countries. they want borders and then we leave our borders open. and they've shipped our jobs and they've shipped our wealth to other countries. to all americans, i say it is time for a new leadership,"" trump said. the criticism came as trump and clinton blitzed the battleground states yesterday, with days to go for the election that will decide the next us president. clinton's long-held lead in new hampshire has collapsed in recent days and nationwide the gap between them has remarkably narrowed to the margin of error in some opinion polls after the fbi revived questions about the democratic nominee

Article 4 - how will the world change after the election? magazine
american intelligence officials are used to forecasting how foreign elections will affect the united states. but whatever would foreign prognosticators make of hillary clinton, donald trump, and the world of november 9 and beyond? we asked some of the smartest spies and analysts we know to turn the tables and imagine they were the national intelligence council dissecting the 2016 election as if the united states were a foreign country. what are the global scenarios or surprising international incidents a president clinton could face—or precipitate? how would america’s role in the world be different from what we’ve seen under president obama? and what happens if donald trump pulls off a win? story continued below on october 25, these four global intelligence specialists—including former nic and cia officials—gathered for a forecasting exercise moderated by politico editor susan glasser. while trump was talking about a “rigged” election and clinton was making a push into red states, the group cast their eyes toward serious international challenges that have largely been ignored on the campaign trail: from the north korean nuclear threat to the future of europe post-brexit, vladimir putin’s designs on the middle east to the collapse of venezuela—and more. here’s the conversation they had, condensed and lightly edited. *** susan glasser: it seems like people are already turning their attention, in many ways, to november 9 and beyond. but everybody feels intuitively that this election is not

Article 5 - the new york senate race
hillary clinton is running in a phantom race for the senate, pitted against an unknown, unqualified opponent. in the unlikely event that new yorkers ever learn what john spencer’s views are, most would find them far too conservative. it’s a measure of the haplessness of mr. spencer’s campaign that the republican nominee has been dogged by rumors that his real aim is to prepare the ground for an attempt to regain his old job as mayor of yonkers. it would be easy to endorse hillary clinton for a second term even if she had a far more credible opponent. mrs. clinton has been an excellent senator — hard-working and in close touch with her state. we have been particularly impressed by her focus on the neglected “first suburbs” of aging housing and decaying infrastructure. as a democrat, she has a limited ability to influence legislation, but she has taken a lead in forming the debate on a number of issues of substance. her bill aimed at fixing the mechanics of voting set the standard for election reform legislation. watching mrs. clinton do her job, we have been impressed by her mastery of even the most obscure details of new york’s problems. her ability to work with republicans has been a pleasant surprise. she has won the genuine respect of most of her colleagues in washington, and she seems to have found a forum in which her lifelong wonkishness can be put to good use. it seems as if in the senate

Article 6 - obama extends streak to 10 and makes inroads among women
in a speech in ohio shortly after the polls closed in wisconsin, she alluded to what her campaign considers mr. obama’s lack of experience, and his support for a health insurance plan that would not initially seek to cover all americans. “this is the choice we face: one of us is ready to be commander in chief in a dangerous world,” mrs. clinton said in the remarks, which she also planned to expand upon in a speech in new york city on wednesday. “one of us has faced serious republican opposition in the past — and one of us is ready to do it again.” mrs. clinton did not mention the wisconsin results; she did, however, call mr. obama to congratulate him on the victory. as mrs. clinton was speaking, mr. obama appeared on stage at a rally in texas, effectively cutting her off as cable television networks dropped her in midsentence, a telling sign of the showmanship power of a front-runner. “houston, i think we achieved liftoff here,” mr. obama told a crowd of 20,000 people in that city as he hailed the voters of wisconsin. “the change we seek is still months and miles away, and we need the good people of texas to help us get there.” photo with 90 percent of the electoral precincts in wisconsin reporting, mr. obama had 58 percent of the vote to mrs. cl

Article 7 - the faithful who will never leave her - cnnpolitics.com
story highlights cnn spoke to hillary clinton supporters in florida, ohio they explain why they support the democratic nominee (cnn) the day after fbi director james comey dropped a grand piano on hillary clinton's campaign, setting off a round of recriminations from top aides and allies, the candidate looked out on a happy-go-lucky assembly of supporters gathered in a small, sticky daytona beach gymnasium. if comey's letter had resurrected the dreaded specter of clinton's emails, her diehards in florida, where she spent most of saturday, were openly untroubled. they dutifully jeered comey's name as clinton called his decision and its timing ""pretty strange,"" but roared when she pivoted back to her usual fare -- a promise to keep ""focused on one thing, you and your families."" apart from the quick round of booing, the crowd here had little to say about the campaign's new bête noire. minutes away from the historically black bethune-cookman university, this was a safe space. her supporters in this coastal city -- the kind of quiet loyalists who could vault her to the white house next week -- didn't just take the fbi news in stride, they mostly strode right past it. retired veteran walter browning, his ""operation iraqi freedom"" cap tipped up high on his head, strained to explain just how little he cared.

Article 8 - let’s grow up, liberals
for revolutionaries, mr. sanders and his supporters sure seemed to expect a lot of help from the establishment. these critiques, unsurprisingly, inspired all sorts of conspiracy theories and wild accusations. i was told by two celebrities that their inability to register as democrats and vote for mr. sanders on the day of new york’s primary showed them “the dark underside of american politics.” mrs. clinton has “gamed the nominating process,” and her election will leave “a national majority of citizens in open rebellion,” wrote a retired professor on alice walker’s official website. an online, “instant documentary” charged the democratic party — and by extension, mrs. clinton — with outright fraud at the polls in california. once mr. sanders’s defeat became inescapable, some of his most die-hard believers began to argue that a trump presidency might even be preferable to having mrs. clinton in the white house. “in a way she is more dangerous,” susan sarandon insisted in june, warning that under a president clinton, “we’ll be in iran in two seconds.” but other sanders diehards are quite prepared to “bring the jubilee” and accept a transformative, trump victory. “i’d rather see the empire burn under to the ground under trump, opening up at least the possibility of radical change, than cruise on autopilot under clinton,” the journalist christopher ketcham wrote in the daily beast

In an exhibition at Asia Society, ""Kamakura: Realism and Spirituality in Japanese Sculpture,"" visitors encountered wonderfully vivid representations of Buddhist divinities from Japan's Kamakura period (1185-1333). The first piece, a dark guardian king head, showcased visionary realism with intense psychological presence.

At the Church of Our Saviour on Park Avenue, a 24-foot-tall Byzantine icon was installed behind the altar. The painting depicts Christ in the ""Pantocrator"" aspect and features a golden halo, recalling the great age of cathedral painting.

The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore featured an exhibition of Louise Bourgeois' works, including ""Nature Study"" (1984), which extended ancient myth into modern times with hair-raising effect. Her sculptures often blended with the museum's collections, creating imaginative juxtapositions.

Article 6 - the fallen angels imprisoned in antarctica and are still alive
the fallen angels imprisoned in antarctica and are still alive % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the book of enoch seems to reveal that the fallen angels are still alive and may very well be in antarctica. no wonder all that strange things that happen in this barren waist land. but what is more shocking is that enoch reveals that the fallen angels are still effecting events and men on the earth. “every visible thing in the world is put under the charge of an angel” st augustine. in 2002 the british newspaper the sunday telegraph reported that the vatican had banned the veneration of those angels who do not appear in the authorized texts of the bible. this was an attempt to counter the influence of unnamed new age groups who were allegedly recruiting new members within the roman catholic church. in future, prayers were only to be directed to the three archangels michael, gabriel and raphael who are mentioned in the bible. according to the apocryphal and banned book of enoch these were the angelic beings responsible for binding the wicked fallen angels or watchers who had transgressed god‘s law. the news report said that the early church had excluded the book, attributed to the old testament prophet and patriarch enoch, from the authorized version of the bible because it described these fallen angels and their activities. who are the watchers or fallen angels and why was the early church and the

Article 8 - the internet post
the vatican city is the heart of the catholic church and the pope (pontifex maximus) is the head of the church and the supreme “spiritual” leader of all of the world’s catholics. but the vatican hides some of the darkest secrets one can imagine. sedes sacrorum – etymology sedes sacrorum (latin for holy seat), known as the holy see in english, is the seal of the vatican city state. sedes sacrorum (ss) “the roman cult* which controls the catholic church maintains that the first person to use the concept of the holy see was st. peter. this of course, is impossible as the etymology of the word “sedes” (see) and its associated meaning were not in existence until hundreds of years after the execution of st. peter in 70 ce at the siege of jerusalem.” [1] *the roman cult is a shadow group of blood-thirsty satanists, which was involved in “child sacrifice, burning people alive (since 11th century ce), demonic worship and absolute celibacy of its lowest priests. since the 1st century bce, its high priests known as ‘pontiffs’ — a hereditary position controlled by a handful of ancient families — claimed the ancient pre-republic title of pontifex maximus after the roman emperors assumed themselves as high priest of the state cult of magna mater (cybele).

Article 1 - to be enlightened, you pull the switch
his subject was emphatically the present, each work being different when experienced one place or another. the light fixtures themselves were nearly beside the point, by which i mean they weren't things you could stare at easily; they resisted standard connoisseurship. if you flipped off the electric switch they effectively stopped being art. they were like duchamp's readymades in that respect (and only in that respect), becoming art by virtue of being declared so because of their placement in a gallery or museum. from this strategy, flavin extracted unexpected variety and eloquence, as the exhibition reminds us. he exemplified a larger truth, that all serious artists, minimalists or otherwise, usually thrive on parameters. ""it is what it is and it ain't nothing else,"" flavin said about his work. ""everything is clearly, openly, plainly delivered. there is no overwhelming spirituality you are supposed to come into contact with."" he added: ""i believe art is shedding its vaunted mystery for a common sense of keenly realized decoration."" that may have been his outlook, but spirituality and mystery are precisely what many people extract from his works, the inevitable reaction to intangible light as a religious motif, passed down in history through countless pictures. it was inherited by this former altar boy from brooklyn, who fondly recalled the ritual of the mass as ""rich in candlelight, music, chant, vestments, processions and incense."" flavin's point wasn't exactly to

Article 2 - spellbinding treasures from japan’s kamakura period at asia society
in different times and places a combustive mix of realism and religion has given rise to some of the world’s greatest art. the european renaissance was one such era. another was the brief kamakura period of japan, from 1185 to 1333. “kamakura: realism and spirituality in the sculpture of japan,” a spellbinding exhibition at asia society, features wonderfully vivid representations of buddhist divinities. the first piece visitors encounter may not seem to agree with modern notions of realism. it’s a dark, nearly 22-inch-tall head of a guardian king, whose ferocious expression appears more cartoonish than naturalistic, carved from japanese cypress sometime in the 13th century. but he has an intense psychological presence in the smooth rendering of his deeply knit brow, gaping mouth revealing tongue and teeth, and bugged-out eyes made of rock crystal with pupils painted on the reverse, a signature innovation of the period. originally attached to a whole, armor-clad warrior, this object does more than just symbolize a mythic character. it also seems to be an incarnation of divine ferocity, as if it were appearing in a dream or a hallucination. more than realism, this is visionary realism. in buddhist lore there are four guardian kings, whose mission is to defend temples and the buddha from evil doers and to scare away fools and knaves ill-equipped for enlightenment. guardian king images were particularly popular during the kamakura period

Article 3 - at a park ave. church, a 'nice, friendly face'
the rev. george w. rutler, pastor of the church of our saviour on park avenue and 38th street, was looking over his church's latest acquisition recently. ""i figure i've made mistakes before,"" he said, ""but if this is one, it'll be a very big mistake."" the item in question is an enormous byzantine icon that father rutler had installed behind the altar of the roman catholic church last week. twenty-four feet high, and placed 10 feet off the ground, the painting shows christ in the aspect sometimes called ""pantocrator,"" or ""ruler of all."" a golden halo sits over his head, and he is bathed in light from above, one hand extended in benediction and the other clutching a jeweled book. parishioners seemed shocked but happy. ""i think it's beautiful,"" said theresa kane. ""i found it overwhelming at first. it takes my breath away."" the lavishness of the work recalls the great age of cathedral painting. ""there's $500 to $600 of gold on the halo itself,"" said donal murray, one of two artists who created the painting. advertisement continue reading the main story the icon is a vast enlargement of a sixth-century painting thought to be among the oldest extant icons of christ. father rutler spotted a medieval copy of it in the exhibition ""byzantium: faith and power"" at the metropolitan museum of art earlier this

Article 4 - 'louise bourgeois: femme' at the walters art museum in baltimore
in a few instances, finding one of ms. bourgeois's works can be a letdown. ""janus in a leather jacket"" (1968), a double-ended, bronze phallic object suspended overhead in a corner of the etruscan department, has too little to do with the small, finely wrought metal antiquities in cases below. photo more often, however, the juxtapositions are imaginative and stimulating. the bronze sculpture of a headless, lionlike beast with multiple pairs of female breasts (""nature study,"" 1984) in an area devoted to egyptian human and animal hybrids extends ancient myth into modern times with hair-raising effect. sometimes ms. bourgeois's works are almost indistinguishable from the museum's works — particularly the primordial-looking ones. if you don't look too closely, you might take the three small, headless female figures in bronze and marble in the greek section for ancient fertility sculptures. one of the best placements is in a palatial gallery called chamber of wonders, where the museum's installation of natural and artistic curiosities imitates a 17th century ""wonder cabinet."" here, in a case near the floor, you find ms. bourgeois's ""spider,"" from 2003: a little female effigy of stuffed pink knitted fabric that is elevated on monstrous stainless-steel spider legs protruding from its torso. the odd combination of materials and the fantastic sculptural image is perfect for a room devoted to

Article 5 - review: ‘the plains indians,’ america’s early artists, at the met
with the arrival of europeans on the plains, life began to change. spanish soldiers and ranchers, coming north from mexico in the 16th century, introduced horses, which indians quickly adopted, mastered and bred. horses dramatically extended the range and efficiency of the buffalo hunt, a primary source of food and of hides for clothing and shelter. plains people became increasingly mobile, moving seasonally with the herds and carrying their lives with them. portability became a requisite, and never has the genre of art-you-can-wear been more inventively explored. painted robes, covered with figures and symbols and accessorized with leggings and gloves, became storyboards of oral history and epic adventure. one monumental example from the branly collection, fittingly known as the grand robe, depicts, in more than a dozen episodes and with a cast of some 60 figures, the homeric exploits of two lakota warriors. there are debates over the gender of the artists of certain robes. but in general, paintings and drawings were done by men, and tanning, sewing and beadwork by women. and outstanding examples of beadwork, positioned throughout the show, glow with a kind of self-generated light. an early-19th-century man’s shirt from the upper missouri river region, on loan from a museum in bern , switzerland , is sewn with just a few glass beads, like a sprinkling of fresh rain. a central plains woman’s dress, from around 1855,

Article 6 - frieze projects puts the focus on physical space
the art of collecting frieze projects puts the focus on physical space image “sitting feeding sleeping,” a 2013 video project by rachel rose. at the frieze art fair this year, she is creating an installation that will try to approximate how the animals of regent’s park experience the fair. credit rachel rose and pilar corrias gallery london — buying, selling, watching, networking. the annual frieze art fair is a high-adrenaline plunge into the cultural zeitgeist. but the fair, which runs from oct. 14 through oct. 17, isn’t just about who is buying and what is selling. each year, frieze projects, a nonprofit branch of the organization, commissions a handful of artists to create ephemeral work that is not for sale, and has no specific brief, but which often seems to offer the artist’s own take on the art world and the fair. this year, the emphasis seems to be an architectural one, with a high proportion of the seven invited artists or artist collectives creating work that reflects, in one way or another, on the physical space of the fair. nicola lees, the curator of frieze projects, said she had been thinking about the idea of temporary architecture but had not specifically asked the artists to work on that theme. “frieze just appears in regents park for a brief period, and that’s quite unique anywhere for a platform on that scale,” she said

Article 7 - once again, frogs land in willimantic
a quartet of giant bluish-green frog sculptures has taken up residence on the massive cement thread spools mounted on willimantic's new bridge across the willimantic river. thread city crossing, as the graceful arched bridge is known, combines the city's two enduring symbols: thread and bullfrogs. the four bronze amphibians, by the sculptor leo jensen of ivoryton, weigh one ton each and measure about 12 feet from tip of toe to top of nostril. their bluish-green color comes from a finish that mimics bronze patina, an ''instant weathering'' according to the bridge architect, william h. grover. they will become a little greener, he said, as they stay outdoors longer, gradually turning to a natural amphibian green. their eyes glow from an application of thin gold leaf. frogs have symbolized the city of willimantic since the mid-1700's. a legend, told in the book, ''legendary connecticut'' (curbstone press, 1984) by david phillips, an eastern connecticut state university professor, inspired the frog motif. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. phillips wrote that city residents were awakened by a fierce noise. according to the legend, many men were off fighting in the french and indian war, so it was women, children and some elderly residents who fled from the noise into the woods. the indians, whom they suspected of

Title: horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god
Content: horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god (before it's news) interview with raven grimassi brought to you by red wheel weiser books. 1. what made you decide to update and revise frederick thomas elworthy’s horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god? this came about from a discussion with my publisher and a shared vision of creating something of increased value for the pagan community. in modern times the major emphasis is on “the goddess” and there is little material solely focused on “the god” in paganism. in this regard, the goal was to introduce a book from the perspective of achieving a balanced view of the other half of the divine in modern paganism. 2. would you share with us some thoughts on the pagan horned god? to me, the pagan image of the masculine polarity of divinity represents the primal force of nature that was venerated by our ancestors. this image arises from the animal kingdom, and in this way unites us with something closer to the natural order of things. the horned god is divinity “untamed” by human design, and is the liberator as opposed to idea of a controlling “god” as envisioned in mainstream religions. 3. being a capricorn i seem to have an affinity for all things horny. ha. such as pan and cernunnos. what can you share with us about these two from the horned pantheon? pan is a concept that reflects fertility and the untamed nature of things. cernunnos, in a sense, is the spirit of the forest, but is also a guide of the dead. this latter theme separates him from pan. to a degree, cernunnos is more refined in comparison to pan, and can be thought of an evolved form of the more idea. 4. could you go into what the chapter horns of the devil embodies and imparts knowledge wise? i feel that the core message is about the contrived image of the judaic-christian devil appearing in the likeness of the pagan god. here we see the sacred profaned by the agenda of the church in its vilification of a rival religion. depicting the devil in pagan imagery was part of an attempt to use fear in order to draw people away from the old gods. converting people to one religion from another is easier when you can make the rival religion seem dangerous or connected to something undesirable. 5. would you go into some ancient cultures where horns play a significant role that some may not be familiar with? as the book indicates, the use of horns and their veneration in the context of gods and animal is widespread across the planet. it’s the persistence into modern times that is truly noteworthy. one example is the “horn dance” at abbots bromley in stafforshire, which features a procession of men carrying antlers. they are accompanied by a musician, a boy holding a triangle
