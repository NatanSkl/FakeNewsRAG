Article 1 - other voices: skepticism, and some fact-checking, please
there is a wider lesson for times readers (or readers of any newspaper) in the page 1 farcical story of the standing-room-only airline ''seat.'' if you see an offbeat page 1 story, enjoy it but be skeptical. conditioned to schedule ''required'' but often dull news on the front page, editors may overreach to put lively but questionable stories there to try to keep readers from being bored. ask yourself: is the colorful story a hoax, suspicious looking or simply too good (or bad) to be true? an adjunct rule of newspaper reading is that just because a newspaper has stories on the front page doesn't mean the stories are either the day's most crucial or most intriguing. be your own editor. page 1 is not the holy grail. check out not only that your mother loves you, but also what's inside the paper, where the best stuff may be found. ernest f. imhoff baltimore, may 21, 2006

Article 2 - ‘american girls,’ by nancy jo sales
thirteen-year-old cassy (sales changed her teenage subjects’ names) says boys her age “blackmail” girls for nude pictures: “they say, oh, i have embarrassing pictures of you, if you don’t send nudes i’ll send them all out on social media.” if a girl relents, boys may share the nude picture with others, or post it to an instagram account devoted to such images. says cassy, “everyone winds up having it.” anecdotes like this make a persuasive case that social media has ratcheted up the pressure girls have long faced to appear both desirable and chaste. less clear from “american girls” is what anyone can do about it. well versed in the contemporary literature on social media and adolescence, sales disagrees with those who say adult worries about teenagers and social media stem from “moral panic” or fear of adolescent sexuality in general. “what this point of view fails to acknowledge,” she writes, “are the ways in which the sexual behavior of teenagers actually is being changed and shaped by thoroughly new technology, smartphones and social media, not to mention the influence of online porn. what’s being avoided are the hard questions about whether these behaviors are in fact healthy or abusive or even legal, from the perspective of the age of consent.” advertisement continue reading the main story these are indeed hard questions, but sales provides few satisfying answers. she tells the story of padma, whose facebook pictures showing her in “casual clothes” and

Article 3 - trial in firebombing of refugees exposes far-right grip in germany
turning on the taps is unlikely to cause injury or even death, as arson might, but is just as certain to cause hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage and to keep migrants from being moved in. the first arson case to gain attention nationwide occurred in the northern bavarian village of vorra in december 2014, when someone set fire to a renovated shelter that was about to receive 40 refugees. almost a year later, four refugee families moved into the re-renovated property. but no one was ever arrested for the fire. tracking anti-immigrant attacks is difficult, in part because of germany’s splintered federal system. but the amadeu antonio foundation, a respected nongovernment source, compiles lists culled from news media and police reports nationwide. advertisement continue reading the main story during the week of jan. 24, for instance, it found 10 suspected racist or right-wing assaults, including an arson on jan. 25 that damaged two houses intended for 25 asylum seekers in witten, in north rhine-westphalia. the trial of mr. l. and his friends, which is taking place in the city of hanover, has similarly exposed a worrying attraction to far-right ideas. the men were said in court to have been among the members of an online chat room known as swastika garage. photo several witnesses testified that a favorite pastime for the two men was drinking heavily and listening to right-wing rock bands

Article 4 - although kidd does it all, nets need him to do more
kidd has been busy in this series. on defense he guards the hummingbird-like parker, fights through screens or hustles back to double-team duncan and help out on the boards. on offense he runs the fast break, controls the halfcourt offense and helps the nets rebound. nets coach byron scott said he would consider resting kidd more to save him for the fourth quarter; kidd says fatigue is not an issue. in game 2, kidd scored 30 points in 42 minutes, bouncing back from game 1, when he missed 13 of 17 shots and scored 10 points. kidd has never had two consecutive poor performances this season. ''like after game 1, i'm sure he'll respond to it,'' the nets' lucious harris said today. meanwhile, the nets need more contributions from the rest of the team. kidd had 11 assists in game 3, but the nets settled for jump shots against the spurs' zone, shooting 37 percent from the field. the nets took 17 free throws in game 3 and have a total of 58 to the spurs' 88 in the series -- a fact that the nets' president, rod thorn, found disconcerting. take away the six times kidd was intentionally fouled in the final 20 seconds of game 2, thorn said, and kidd has gone to the line four times.

The language used is introspective and philosophical, with no apparent claims about systemic issues such as toxic drugs, vaccines, or genetically modified food. Additionally, there are no references to specific experts, politicians, or historical figures that would suggest the article is discussing current events or policy issues. The tone of the article also suggests a personal and introspective nature, rather than a news article attempting to persuade or inform readers about a particular topic. Overall, the language and content of the article align more closely with a personal reflection or essay than a news article.","The articles discuss various topics, including personal development, globalism, education, and spirituality. They highlight the importance of critically examining one's own thoughts and biases to achieve true freedom and understanding.

Some authors argue that societal collapse or crumble is a possibility due to systemic issues such as toxic drugs, vaccines, and genetically modified food. Others propose that the current system is designed to maintain control through manipulation of individuals' spiritual predispositions and ideals.

The concept of ""critical consciousness"" is discussed in the context of education, where students are often forced into passive roles, denying them the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills. This can lead to a lack of awareness and understanding of one's own thoughts and emotions.

Additionally, some authors suggest that individuals are trapped by their own voices, emotions, and traumas, leading to feelings of powerlessness and disconnection from themselves and others.

The articles also touch on the idea of ""eudaimonia,"" or living well, which involves striving for virtue, excellence, and ethical wisdom. This can be achieved through practices such as flow states and self-awareness.

Overall, these articles encourage readers to question their assumptions, challenge their own thoughts, and seek a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.","Key points from the articles include:

* The erosion of democratic values and the rise of tribal nationalism, which can be attributed to factors such as inequality and the cynical manipulation of negative human emotions.
* The importance of upholding the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in maintaining a healthy democracy.
* The concept of ""wrongness"" and its significance in understanding human behavior, particularly in the context of predictions and expert opinions.
* The enduring legacy of Benjamin Franklin, who is often reduced to his adages and aphorisms, but whose contributions extend far beyond these quotes.
* The rise of religious fundamentalism as a threat to conservatism and individual liberty, which can lead to hostility towards pluralism and diversity.
* The role of historical figures such as Henry Kissinger and George Kennan in shaping the Cold War policy and their perspectives on America's capacity to shape the world.
* The importance of critical thinking and skepticism in maintaining a healthy society, exemplified by figures like H.L. Mencken who challenged provinciality and double standards.
* The decay of democratic values and the need for individuals to retain their humanity amidst the catastrophic machinery of modern society.

Article 1 - perhaps a crumble rather than a collapse – chapter one
(before it's news) perhaps a crumble rather than a collapse – chapter one by cognitive dissonance why even question the obvious? when contemplating a complex subject, especially one in which i hold a strong emotional investment, i find it extremely valuable to seriously and consistently challenge my own thinking, to play devil’s advocate with my oftentimes emotional mind. a ‘truth’ untested, particularly one i’m emotionally bound to, is little more than a belief, a comforting factoid that confirms my biases rather than enlightening and informing my mind. if i am to progress in my personal development i must test the mettle of my beliefs up to, and if need be well past, their destruction. for only then can i truly be free to exercise, and honor, my personal sovereignty on an everyday basis. so it is that i’ve been considering the concept of ‘collapse’ with regard to society and its socioeconomic system(s), both on a personal and collective emotional and psychological basis. while it is always dangerous to paint detailed pictures with broad brushes, to some degree or another we are all emotional human beings. so while the cognitive details may vary (greatly) from person to person, our tendencies and triggers are very similar (partly because of a shared and distorted worldview) and relatively easy to discern if we have the courage to first look deeply within and then apply what we have found to the world around us. a word of warning here because this article is not a technical or fundamental economic analysis

(before it's news) “education either functions as an instrument which is used to facilitate integration of the younger generation into the logic of the present system and bring about conformity or it becomes the practice of freedom, the means by which men and women deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world.” - paulo freire, pedagogy of the oppressed to the oppressed, and to those who suffer with them and fight at their side pdf download: pedagogy of the oppressed critical consciousness paulo freire uses the term “critical consciousness” in his analysis of the current model of education in action at this time in nearly all modem countries. identified by him as the “banking concept of education”, freire exposes the educational system as one in which the teacher is the depositor and the students are simply depositories; the teacher issues standard communique’s (instead of actual communication) which students passively receive, memorize, and repeat; knowledge becomes a gift bestowed by those who are certified and therefore deemed knowledgeable upon those who are considered ignorant; teachers and administrators of the system develop the instructional program content and students are forced to adapt to it; and the more students work at storing the deposits, the more they accept and excel in the passive role impressed upon them and thus are completely denied the opportunity to develop any ability of critical consciousness (friere 257). many, is not all, students are very familiar with this type of “education”, as we

Article 4 - prisoners of the voice
prisoners of the voice headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! elva thompson, guest waking times “what, then, is the soul but a prisoner of your flesh? an undying yet constrained energy, bound and enslaved within a shuffling, steadily rotting suit of tissue and savage needs?” – david wong we are all prisoners of the voice in the mind we are all prisoners of the voice in our minds, and slaves to our programmed emotions, traumas, fears, intellect, ambition and the ‘poor wronged little i’. many people identify their ‘ego i’ as being the centre of their universe, and the ‘i am so and so’ and ‘i do this’ is who they are, lock, stock and barrel. the personality and its ‘whirled’ is the total sum of their awareness- the only thing that is real in terms of the five senses. constant replay i spends its days busy thinking about its hopes, dreams, chores, agendas and how they can be achieved. ‘i am’ revisits the past, dwells on grievances, betrayals and sleights which replay over and over again in the present along with all the feelings and sensations of the original event. most of us are in mind all the time, our thoughts are crowded with fear and expectation, we worry about tomorrow – what if we lose our job and what is going to happen to us and our loved ones in the future…

Article 5 - big brother is not looking out for you
big brother is not looking out for you (before it's news) “your spiritual predispositions and ideals are being greatly manipulated at this time. there are entire teachings being introduced into the world now that teach human acquiescence and the suspension of critical abilities and value only that which is pleasurable and comfortable. these teachings are given to disable people’s ability to access knowledge within themselves until people reach a point where they feel they are completely dependent upon greater forces that they cannot identify. at that point, they will follow whatever is given them to do, and even if they sense something is wrong, they will no longer have the power to resist.” we are looking in the wrong direction and sending the wrong message to the universe. stephen hawking is admirable, not merely for his earlier, prescient views about life in the universe, where he notes the comparison with the history of native peoples on earth. his reversal now on the merits of broadcasting into space ignores the widespread evidence of the alien presence already in our world, and so he misses the begging question, why is the presence kept secret? “there are indeed forces at hand that are not benevolent and are using human beings for purposes that do not support the well-being of humanity.” – greater community visitations kudos for hawking to have concern about the content of the message sent out, yet we continuously and blindly broadcast the equivalent of a brain dump out into space. either with hawking we think we are alone — forgetting

Article 6 - lee duigon -- oblivion, here we come
oblivion, here we come by lee duigon july 23, 2015 newswithviews.com so how’s this for something to do, to keep busy? tear out the heart of your culture, hold a fire sale of its ideals (“everything must go!”), and then fill up the gaping wound with ideas and practices that virtually the entire human race has condemned and rejected throughout all of history. that’ll work! it’s got to! after all, nobody knew anything until sometime in the 1990s. before that, everyone was wrong about everything. almost everyone is still wrong about almost everything, but now at least we’ve got real smart intellectuals and scientific experts who are always right and all we’ve got to do is listen to them, and obey. with this in mind, along comes the learning channel with “all that jazz,” a schlockumentary about a “transgendered teen… as she [it’s really a he] balances school, family, and her [he is not a her, in fact] social life,” yatta-yatta. okay, so we’re going to have a new culture, a whole new civilization that’ll be so nice to live in, you just won’t believe it. but first our glorious leaders and culture-shapers are going to have to discard a few of those old traditions that hold us back from achieving utopia. these must go. here are some of the ones that must go, like, right away

consciously hosting the presence of the already resident. (before it's news) dog poet transmitting……. may your noses always be cold and wet. i want to share one of my finer secrets with you today. i hesitate to do this because of the limitations of the written word. certainly i can get the bones of it into a rough draft but can i convey the essence of the state? we shall see. i shall take some time to get around to it as i sketch out various companion features so as to also create something of a pictograph. most of you are familiar with that brief metaphysical exercise by brother lawrence called, “the practice of the presence of god.” probably you are also familiar with this meditation; “be still and know that i am god.” for a good long while, at odd moments, as a result of my ongoing kundalini uprisings, i have been able to feel the silhouette of the deity within. how do i describe it? it is a combination of my awareness of myself within the moment and then of an awareness of a finer etheric otherness that outlines, or rather inlines my own being and i am able to sense it as if i were it and the experience is, first of all, one of timeless being. it is almost like a creature of dance in synchronized movement that expresses itself in poses and mudras. there is no speech there, nor is there a communication between me and this otherness, other than that

the power of eudaimonia: flow states & knowing thyself % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by gary z mcgee “the ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia, happiness in the sense of living well, which all men desire; all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it.” ~ hannah arendt eudaimonia is a greek word referring to healthy, happy and prosperous human flourishing, especially as a striving toward arête (virtue or excellence) and ethical wisdom. morally, eudaimonia refers to moral or amoral actions that result in the essential value of independent and interdependent well-being. when used creatively, eudaimonia can be breathtakingly effective at stretching comfort zones, shattering mental paradigms, flattening status-quo boxes, and propelling us into heightened states of awareness and compassion. but how to reach it, is the question. how do we tap into this most sacred state of being? this article hypothesizes two possible concepts that, when combined, may give us an “answer:” know thyself & flow states. let’s break it down. know thyself “nobody is an ‘i’ in any substantial sense without a ‘you’ and a ‘they,’ and our self-understanding is formed as much by others as by ourselves.” ~ patrick stokes, new philosopher to know thyself is

Article 1 - the rule of law a reboot for democracy
struggling, like so many others, with the overwhelming sense of despondency at trump’s election, compounding the lingering depression of brexit, as one tries to find some explanation for the spreading darkness of the tribal nationalism that seems to be pervading so many of the countries long viewed as the bastions of progressive society, it is too easy to offer the cloak of alienation from the “ruling class”, or even of ignorance, to those who, with their votes, are welcoming the leaders of this regression. undoubtedly, inequality, so accentuated in recent times, plays a significant part. however, what is common to the success of such leaders is their cynical and dangerous plumbing of the depths of the most negative facets of human nature. the veneer of civilisation, painstakingly applied over so many years by the now seemingly distant voices of enlightenment, ever brittle, has become fractured, allowing those who seek to do so – trump, farage, johnson, le pen, et al – to prise open the fissures, breathing the oxygen of negativity on to the malevolence which had been so precariously contained, fuelling the hostility towards whatever factions happen to present themselves as enemies of convenience. how vital, therefore, that we hold firmly to those tenets of true democracy, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. it is a sad reflection on the state of america that the supreme court has become so politicised. as our supreme court faces its stern

Article 2 - hey, character and ability!
whether chronicling the lives of leaders, inventors, artists or athletes, russell freedman presents his subjects both in the context of their extraordinary accomplishments and as individuals whose vision and values ran counter to the prevailing wisdom and prejudices of their time. the moral might be that the truly great are true to themselves, no matter what. certainly this was so for confucius, who was born around 551 b.c. living in a time of corruption and unrest, when feudal lords fought among themselves, taxes were high and peasants often starved, he believed ''the right to govern . . . should depend on a person's character and ability, not on his birth.'' a revolutionary idea. he also believed that if education were open to rich and poor alike, class distinctions would soon disappear and governments would be run by the most able people. ''confucius was searching for an enlightened ruler who would allow him to put his ideas about government into practice,'' freedman writes. ''he never found one.'' instead, confucius became a teacher, accepting students from all levels of society. a true visionary, he attacked hereditary privilege and espoused the idea of harmony in human affairs, achieved through the daily practice of courtesy and respect toward others. he also opposed ''doublespeak.'' asked what he would do first if he had political power, confucius replied: ''i would start using honest language. without a doubt, i'd want to call things by their right names. . .

Article 3 - up front: kathryn schulz
according to kathryn schulz, the author of “being wrong: adventures in the margin of error,” the idea to study the human propensity for making mistakes came to her “basically out of the ether.” photo “in late 2004, while working as a journalist, i suddenly started registering wrongness, in the same surprising way that you sometimes learn a new word and then hear it twice more that afternoon,” she told us via e-mail. “it struck me as a kind of missing piece — an unusually rich, weird, influential category of human experience that had somehow gone largely unexplored. i knew instantly that i was going to write a book about it, which was startling, given that before this, i hadn’t been planning to write any book at all.” in the book review this week, schulz reviews dan gardner’s “future babble,” which examines the general worthlessness of predictions by so-called experts — their tendency, that is, to be wrong. not that those experts, be they analysts holding forth on the financial crisis or pundits making bold claims about politics, are often likely to recant, schulz said. “talking about wrongness in any serious way requires empathy, intellectual curiosity and humility,” she wrote, “and those values are not exactly dominant in contemporary public life.”

Article 4 - a more enduring legacy
to the editor: re “ben franklin is a big fat idiot,” by joe queenan (july 4): while on the steps of the national archives for the annual reading of the declaration of independence on july 4 — as a spot-on ben franklin impersonator rehearsed his grievances against king george iii — my cellphone buzzed with an e-mailed link. imagine my horror as i opened it to find our poor founding visionary — initiator of hospitals, libraries, colleges, fire squads and unions; inventor of lightning rods and swim fins; cosmologist, epidemiologist, psychologist, philosopher, postmaster, printer — reduced to a few out-of-context quotations. i tried to relax. but hours later, as uncle sam perambulated down constitution avenue on stilts, i still could not shake the essay, particularly its claim that franklin’s “most enduring legacy” is his “adages, axioms and aphorisms.” i prefer to think of our country as a more enduring legacy. andrew maxwell mangino washington

Article 5 - where the right went wrong
“the conservatism i grew up around” sullivan writes on the second page of the book, “was a combination of lower taxes, less government spending, freer trade, freer markets, individual liberty, personal responsibility and a strong anti-communist foreign policy.” his heroes were thatcher, reagan, solzhenitsyn, havel, hayek and orwell. but over the past few years, he argues, something new has usurped conservatism and threatened the world — religious fundamentalism. it is a mindset more than a faith, sullivan argues: “its core is not the individual conscience, but god himself, and the decision of the individual to surrender himself to god entirely as the premise of every action he commits and every decision he makes.” the fundamentalist, sullivan continues, is hostile to pluralism, feels alienated from society, surrenders to authority and is untroubled by doubt. “the fundamentalist does not tolerate a diversity of views. there is one truth; and all other pretenders are threats to it, or contradict it.” sullivan periodically distinguishes between the muslim fundamentalism of the terrorists and the christian fundamentalists he says now dominate the republican party, but he sees them as part of the same continuum, and often leaps between the two. he argues that nazis, communists, wahhabists and certain orthodox protestants, catholics and jews are all fundamentalists. he throws osama bin laden onto the fundamental

Article 6 - who put the ‘cold’ in cold war?
photo back in the mid-1970s, natan sharansky and his fellow soviet dissidents bitterly amused themselves by conducting mock trials of henry kissinger, the architect of the détente policy that left them feeling abandoned. sharansky, as judge, would sentence kissinger to exile in the soviet union without benefit of the jackson amendment, which pressured the soviets to permit jews to emigrate. one can scarcely imagine the punishment he would have meted out to george kennan (1904-2005), the diplomat-scholar who laid the foundations for the cold war policy kissinger later executed, and who, we learn from john lukacs’s elegant and elegiac biography, sharply opposed “the american insistence that the soviet union facilitate emigration of its citizens in accord with some american preferences.” sharansky would not have been surprised to learn that kennan also felt “fairly at home” in berlin in the years before america’s entry into world war ii, and “regretted” our involvement in the war (though he later wrote that the holocaust was sufficient reason to fight germany). kennan’s unillusioned and often bleak assessment of america’s capacity to shape the world according to its wishes was, save for a brief period at the dawn of the cold war, too harsh a medicine for washington’s policy makers to swallow. americans, as kennan was grimly aware, are enamored of

Article 7 - editorial observer; remembering the permanent opposition of h. l. mencken
every generation needs a mencken. not h. l. mencken proper, reincarnated in all his old prejudices, but an observer as critical of the provinciality and double standards of the moment as mencken was of those in his own time. this is the man who lies at the heart of terry teachout's new biography, called, appropriately, ''the skeptic.'' mencken's peak came in the 1920's, a decade when america seemed to awake out of a lilac and camphor scented daydream into a more vigorous and honest sense of what life was all about. some of that was mencken's doing. he did everything he could to discredit the oppressive pieties of his time, many of which enjoy renewed strength today. he loved a foe almost better than a friend. he had more opinions than he knew how to organize, which made self-contradiction inevitable, and he did not believe in keeping his opinions down for the sake of mere consistency. mencken began as a baltimore reporter, but it wasn't long before he realized that his true calling was to blow up the false fronts on main street and stand laughing over the rubble. the brash sound of his voice in newspaper columns and in magazines like the smart set and the american mercury was one of the things that helped america wake up as the first world war ended and the country began to shake off its wartime hysteria. to attack mencken for being ''merely'' critical is

Article 8 - consortiumnews.com

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Key points from the articles include:

* The erosion of democratic values and the rise of tribal nationalism, which can be attributed to factors such as inequality and the cynical manipulation of negative human emotions.
* The importance of upholding the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in maintaining a healthy democracy.
* The concept of ""wrongness"" and its significance in understanding human behavior, particularly in the context of predictions and expert opinions.
* The enduring legacy of Benjamin Franklin, who is often reduced to his adages and aphorisms, but whose contributions extend far beyond these quotes.
* The rise of religious fundamentalism as a threat to conservatism and individual liberty, which can lead to hostility towards pluralism and diversity.
* The role of historical figures such as Henry Kissinger and George Kennan in shaping the Cold War policy and their perspectives on America's capacity to shape the world.
* The importance of critical thinking and skepticism in maintaining a healthy society, exemplified by figures like H.L. Mencken who challenged provinciality and double standards.
* The decay of democratic values and the need for individuals to retain their humanity amidst the catastrophic machinery of modern society.

These points highlight key themes and ideas that are central to the articles, providing a concise summary of the main arguments and concepts presented.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various topics, including personal development, globalism, education, and spirituality. They highlight the importance of critically examining one's own thoughts and biases to achieve true freedom and understanding.

Some authors argue that societal collapse or crumble is a possibility due to systemic issues such as toxic drugs, vaccines, and genetically modified food. Others propose that the current system is designed to maintain control through manipulation of individuals' spiritual predispositions and ideals.

The concept of ""critical consciousness"" is discussed in the context of education, where students are often forced into passive roles, denying them the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills. This can lead to a lack of awareness and understanding of one's own thoughts and emotions.

Additionally, some authors suggest that individuals are trapped by their own voices, emotions, and traumas, leading to feelings of powerlessness and disconnection from themselves and others.

The articles also touch on the idea of ""eudaimonia,"" or living well, which involves striving for virtue, excellence, and ethical wisdom. This can be achieved through practices such as flow states and self-awareness.

Overall, these articles encourage readers to question their assumptions, challenge their own thoughts, and seek a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.

He convinced the girl to send explicit images after claiming he knew Bieber and offered to arrange a text meeting with her. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department believes Asrary may have targeted other young fans.

Justin Bieber has been involved in several incidents, including removing his shirt at airport security in Poland, which led to him being referred to as a ""dweeb."" He also allegedly punched Orlando Bloom after the actor refused to greet him.

Bieber has used his platform to promote animal adoption, encouraging his fans to adopt pets from shelters instead of buying from breeders or pet stores. His own pet, a papillon named Sam, was adopted from a shelter.

Justin Bieber's YouTube channel has been active for five years, and he has gained a significant following worldwide. However, some incidents have raised questions about his behavior, including an incident where he allegedly punched Orlando Bloom after the actor refused to greet him.

In another incident, Bieber removed his shirt at airport security in Poland, which led to him being referred to as a ""dweeb."" This incident has been widely reported and has sparked debate about Bieber's behavior.","Law enforcement agencies are cracking down on online child exploitation. In a federal investigation, 10 individuals were arrested for possessing and distributing images of prepubescent minors. The Candyman website, advertised as a group for people who love kids, was found to have over 100 still and video images of children under the age of 12.

Meanwhile, a case in Maryland involves 8,000 menacing posts on Twitter about a Buddhist leader, with some arguing that such speech is protected by the First Amendment. A hacker, identified as Aerith, disrupted government websites in Canada, claiming responsibility for website disruptions to support an Ottawa teenager charged with making hoax telephone calls.

In Texas, a judge ordered notices warning of sex offenders, requiring them to post signs and provide phone numbers for reporting suspicious behavior. Lawmakers criticized the FBI and Justice Department for failing to cooperate with congressional investigations into online child exploitation.

An online forum user was advised not to contact moderators about a potential case of child abuse, as they may not be obligated to report it. Meanwhile, Pete Townshend, guitarist of The Who, was arrested after his name appeared on a list of 7,000 people in Britain whose identities were passed on by American investigators.

Article 1 - 10 arrested in federal investigation of internet child pornography
''as you can see,'' mr. kelley said, ''those who collect and receive images of sexual abuse of children are not nameless faces lurking in cyberspace, nor are they shadowy figures leering in a dark alley. but they come from every cross-section of our society and both our urban and suburban neighborhoods.'' prosecutors said that the children depicted in the images found in the possession of the defendants were 12 years old and younger. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. ''we're not talking about teenagers,'' said barbara d. underwood, the chief assistant united states attorney in brooklyn. ''we're talking about children.'' the candyman web site advertised itself as a group ''for people who love kids,'' according to an f.b.i. affidavit filed in the new york case. the f.b.i. investigation into the group began in january 2001, the affidavit says, when an agent, acting under cover, sent an e-mail message and joined the web site. the site made available to members about 100 still and video images, the majority of which were of prepubescent minors

Article 2 - case of 8,000 menacing posts tests limits of twitter speech
in a complaint filed in federal court in maryland, the federal bureau of investigation concluded that mr. cassidy had published 8,000 twitter posts, almost all of them about ms. zeoli and her buddhist group, along with similar posts on several blogs. mr. cassidy’s lawyers with the federal public defender’s office argue that even offensive, emotionally distressing speech is protected by the first amendment when it is conveyed on a public platform like twitter. legal scholars say the case is significant because it grapples with what can be said about a person, particularly a public person like a religious leader, versus what can be said to a person. eugene volokh, a law professor at the university of california, los angeles, offered an analogy: the difference between harassing telephone calls and ranting from a street-corner pulpit. “when the government restricts speech to one person, the speaker remains free to speak to the public at large,” mr. volokh argued. certainly mr. cassidy’s previous trespasses have not helped him. he has a record of assault, arson and domestic violence. according to the federal complaint, he was also convicted of carrying an unspecified “dangerous weapon” onto a plane in 1993. but the defense has taken pains to point out that across the internet, people post things that may cause emotional distress to others: an unkind review of a book on amazon, even an unvarnished assessment by a college

Article 3 - who's 14, 'kewl' and flirty online?; a 39-year-old detective, and he knows his bra size
the girl was actually detective michael smith, 39, who a prosecutor said had conversed with the rabbi in an internet chat room called ''i love older men.'' detective smith -- who calls himself a ''starbucks, barnes & noble kind of guy'' -- has become something of an expert in early teenagedom, and he has done so without the benefit of having offspring of the appropriate age. he ventures into cyberspace under some 30 different screen names, mostly as girls, each with her own personality, looks and even bra size (a prosecutor said the rabbi, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted endangerment of and disseminating indecent material to a minor, had wanted to know). because adults who want to prey on children are aware that people like detective smith and his partners, detectives travis rapp and michael gishner, are out there, it is very important to keep those characters straight. ''they tell you in the training that you can keep track by writing down, for example, 'barbara, blue eyes, blond hair, etc.' but you would never remember,'' detective smith said, speaking in an office almost as narrow as his computer screen is wide. his own method is to model and name each character after a real woman he knows. ''i'll morph her description down to that of an 11-year-old,'' he said. detective smith, who has been on the force for 17 years, began his career as a virtual

Article 4 - hacker disrupts government websites in canada
ottawa — since friday, people turning to the websites of canada’s parliament, its supreme court, the city of ottawa and the ottawa and toronto police forces have been occasionally greeted by a gyrating, anthropomorphic banana or, more frequently, an error message. the disruptions were prompted by a hacker or a small group of hackers supporting the cause of an ottawa teenager who was charged last spring with making hoax telephone calls throughout north america. the calls led the police in a number of provinces and states to send out tactical squads in response to supposed emergencies, a practice known as swatting. using the name aerith, with slight variations, the hacker claimed responsibility for the website disruptions in emails and a posting online. the sender claimed to be affiliated with the shadowy online collective anonymous. when asked by email how many people were involved, aerith, who said that he or she was in brazil, replied, “we act as a group.” at some point in the past few weeks, the hacker contacted the family of the ottawa teenager, who cannot be identified under canadian law, claiming to have information that would vindicate him. the youth was charged with 60 criminal counts related to the episodes after an investigation by canadian police forces and the f.b.i. during a weekend news conference, the boy’s father said he discovered what he described as law enforcement eavesdropping equipment hidden in compact fluorescent light bulbs in his home, based on information provided by the hackers. advertisement continue

Article 5 - texas judge orders notices warning of sex offenders
although the state district judge who required the warnings, judge j. manuel ba~nales, later reduced to 14 the number of offenders who must post the signs, he refused an appeal on thursday to amend his order. ''they have only themselves to blame,'' judge ba~nales said. the signs -- ''danger: registered sex offender lives here'' -- give phone numbers for reporting ''suspicious behavior.'' bumper stickers have similar wording. a portable version modeled after the diamond-shaped ''baby on board'' stencils, complete with an adhesive suction cup, were provided to the offenders. ''wherever they go,'' judge ba~nales said, ''whatever time of day or night, we want people to be aware of where these offenders are.'' . judge ba~nales said texas laws requiring that sex criminals' pictures and addresses be posted on the internet and in local newspapers did not go far enough in protecting children from sexual predators. ''a lot of people can't afford to go on the internet, particularly in poorer neighborhoods,'' he said, ''and some people just don't read newspapers.'' mr. rogen, who is considering additional legal challenges to the order, said the signs were cruel and unusual punishment that would eventually be overturned by a higher court. but many people here applauded the warnings. ''i think it's a great idea,'' said adriana quiroz, who lives in an apartment complex where a sign was posted. ''this way everyone knows to

Article 6 - f.b.i. and justice dept. are faulted over child predators on web
washington, april 6 — lawmakers from both parties continued on thursday to question the commitment of the justice department and the federal bureau of investigation to halting the online exploitation of children. they also accused the agencies of failing to provide major witnesses for a congressional investigation into the matter. house members voiced their protest before and after testimony on the second day of hearings of the oversight and investigations subcommittee, part of the house committee on energy and commerce. the tenor of the hearings, which focused on law enforcement efforts to capture online predators and rescue child victims, signaled that a showdown might be imminent. ""we keep trying to cooperate with the justice department and the f.b.i.,"" said representative joe l. barton, republican of texas, the chairman of the full committee. speaking directly to william w. mercer, a united states attorney for montana who testified at the hearings, mr. barton said: ""you folks seem bound and determined to be as uncooperative as possible. i'm going to call the attorney general one more time, and we had better get the people we want to testify."" advertisement continue reading the main story mr. mercer testified that the caseload of the child exploitation section had increased 445 percent in the last four years, adding that federal prosecutions of child pornography and abuse cases increased to more than 1,500 cases last year from 344 in 1995.

Article 7 - online cry for help

(the wolf who cried, “boy!”) when it comes to contacting forum administrators, different services have different policies. of the moderated forums on espn.com, patrick stiegman, the site’s executive editor, says: “our terms of service do not obligate us to review or respond to such issues — and the privacy policy would prevent it unless there was illegal activity

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Law enforcement agencies are cracking down on online child exploitation. In a federal investigation, 10 individuals were arrested for possessing and distributing images of prepubescent minors. The Candyman website, advertised as a group for people who love kids, was found to have over 100 still and video images of children under the age of 12.

Meanwhile, a case in Maryland involves 8,000 menacing posts on Twitter about a Buddhist leader, with some arguing that such speech is protected by the First Amendment. A hacker, identified as Aerith, disrupted government websites in Canada, claiming responsibility for website disruptions to support an Ottawa teenager charged with making hoax telephone calls.

In Texas, a judge ordered notices warning of sex offenders, requiring them to post signs and provide phone numbers for reporting suspicious behavior. Lawmakers criticized the FBI and Justice Department for failing to cooperate with congressional investigations into online child exploitation.

An online forum user was advised not to contact moderators about a potential case of child abuse, as they may not be obligated to report it.

Law enforcement agencies are working to identify and prosecute online predators, with the FBI's Child Exploitation Section seeing a significant increase in caseloads over the past four years.

margarito quintero rosales was in the country illegally and not licensed to drive when he fell asleep at the wheel in 2016 and crossed the center line of a texas highway, ultimately striking a vehicle driven by collin county volunteer firefighter captain peter hacking, who was killed in the crash, as were his four-year-old daughter ellie and his 22-month-old son grayson. his widow courtney hacking has been left to raise their four remaining children alone. as if this wasn’t tragic enough already, a judge’s decision has now compounded courtney’s pain exponentially. rosales had been deported once in 2008, but as so many of the illegals who wind up killing american citizens do, he made his back into the country. fast forward eight years to 2016 and rosales was arrested at the scene of the accident, where hacking and his two young children died. he was held in jail until his conviction. in june 2016, a collin county grand jury indicted rosales on three counts of manslaughter. in texas, the penalty range for each count is anywhere from two to twenty years in prison. rosales should have received the maximum and spent the rest of his natural life behind bars to pay for his crime. however, that’s not the outcome of this upsetting story. far from it, actually. court records obtained by breitbart texas show quintero struck a deal with prosecutors from collin county district attorney greg willis’

(before it's news) submitted by chris holly on sun, 01/16/2011 the strangest of the strange ufo reports image by sterling_red i do not even know where to begin with this article as it is maybe the strangest group of ufo reports ever sent to me. since the reports came over a period of time from different people located all over the world i can only trust in what they are telling me and pass it on to my readers. obviously the people are seeing something very odd. since the reports are not related in any way yet very similar i can only think something new has come our way which we all need to be aware of. i will say that we should all be prepared for unusual reports as the activity in our skies continues to change and grow. i will admit these new sightings even took me off guard at first. once i was sent reports from people all over the world who did not know each other i knew something new was on the horizon. i had to wonder how many others may have seen something similar and felt it time to write about this floating building phenomenon. if you have seen something similar do email me with your report so this new strangeness can be brought forth as another unknown. a while ago i wrote a story about a large rectangle light seen over the field of a man who owns a huge track of land deep in the canadian wilderness. he came across a huge building size square object of solid light hovering over one of his fields

Article 7 - telling the difference between intuition and fear
telling the difference between intuition and fear (before it's news) adapted from dr. judith orloff’s ny times bestseller “emotional freedom: liberate yourself from negative emotions and transform your life” (three rivers press, 2011) in “emotional freedom” my approach to transforming fear has two stages. first, take stock of what makes you afraid and distinguish irrational fears from legitimate intuitions. second, take appropriate steps to heed protective fears and transform the others with courage. at times you may foresee real danger, but more frequently unproductive fears clobber you. therefore as a general rule, train yourself to question fears tied to low self-esteem; we’re all worthy of what’s extraordinary. for example, it’s right to question the fear that you’re too emotionally damaged to love; even the severely wounded can have their hearts opened again. true intuitions will never put you down or support destructive attitudes or behavior. here are some guidelines for distinguishing legitimate fears from irrational ones: how to tell fear from intuition signs of a reliable intuition conveys information neutrally, unemotionally feels right in your gut has a compassionate, affirming tone gives crisp, clear impressions that are “seen” first, then felt conveys a detached sensation, like you’re in a theater watching a movie signs of an irrational fear is highly emotionally charged has cruel, demeaning, or delusional content conveys no gut-centered confirmation or on-target feeling reflects past psychological wounds diminish

Article 8 - woman filmed herself sexually abusing 1yo son and sells it online for $$300
krystal harvey, 23, was sentenced to eight months of home detention after admitting to sexually violating her 1-year-old son and producing the offensive one minute-long video at the request of a pedophile. she had applied for permanent name suppression at manukau district court the victim’s paternal grandparents and the baby’s father wanted her to be named in public and the judge said it would be wrong to go against their wishes. “it’s something you’re going to have to live with,” judge phil recordon told harvey. the horrible incident happened in august 2014 after a 21-year-old christ church man contacted her online and the pair formed a somewhat weird bond. they discovered the video when they were investigating the man, who is before the court on 16 charges. “how can a mother, supposed to be protecting her child from the pedophiles of the world, expose him to them,” the child’s grandmother said. harvey had admittedly told police that she did it for the money and bought a laptop with the $$300 given to her. judge recordon said the breach of trust was “at the highest level a mother could be involved with” but was not convinced jail was the answer. “you’re someone who very clearly has never been able to form an attachment with anyone. your life has really been a mess until now,” he told harvey, stating that she was highly vulnerable because of her own turbulent upbringing. he said harvey needed psychological rehabilitation,

The article also provides specific examples, like Walmart's approach to becoming leaner machines and the potential increase in lipstick sales due to economic uncertainty.

* The company's vertically integrated business model and patented glazing technologies contribute to its success.
* Consumer staples companies tend to perform well during economic downturns due to essential products like food and household items.
* A small number of corporations, including Nestle, PepsiCo, and Unilever, control a significant portion of the grocery market.
* The consumer staples sector has historically performed defensively, with shares up 5.3% in 2011 despite a broader market decline.
* Companies in this sector face challenges due to elevated food prices and macro-economic uncertainty.
* Joe's Jeans (JOEZ) recently reported declining revenues and gross margins, leading to negative free cash flow.

* Companies in this sector may struggle to pass on increased prices to customers, leading to sales declines.

These points highlight key themes from various articles, including the performance of Diamond Foods, the dominance of a few corporations in the grocery market, and the challenges faced by consumer staples companies.","Businesses are adapting to changing market conditions. Walmart, the largest retailer, is pushing suppliers to become leaner machines to keep costs down. This approach has reshaped industry practices and led to consolidation among retailers. The company's business practices have been emulated but also criticized for their impact on labor conditions in overseas factories.

In the cosmetics industry, Clinique and Duwop are preparing for a big year in lip color due to economic uncertainty. Lipstick sales could increase as women splurge on luxury items during tough times. Economists believe that lipstick is not an inferior good, but rather a small indulgence or substitute for a bigger-ticket item.

The food additive DHA has failed to materialize as expected, despite significant investment by Martek. Competition from other omega-3 fatty acids has led to questions about the benefits of DHA and its derivation from algae or anchovies.

Inflation is rising, with prices paid by American producers jumping 1.1% in March. The Federal Reserve faces a difficult spot ahead of its meeting, as businesses may not pass on costs to consumers due to weak demand.

The retail sector is experiencing challenges, with some companies laying off employees and reporting declining profits. Tesco's CEO warns brands not to make UK shoppers pay for weak pound fluctuations.

Economic growth is slight, but consumer spending is weakening. Swelling inventories could lead to potential trouble in the months ahead, as businesses may need to lay off workers or trim working hours.

diamond foods to grow on turnaround strategies – analyst blog % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) on jul 3, 2014, we issued an updated research report on diamond foods, inc. (dmnd). the company recently posted its third-quarter fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share. though earnings missed the zacks consensus estimate of 16 cents, it registered 37.5% year-over-year growth. moreover, the company’s top line climbed 3.2% year over year to $$190.9 million, marginally surpassing the zacks consensus estimate of $$189.0 million. robust performance at the snacks division was offset by increased walnut prices that weighed on the nuts segment’s performance. diamond foods’ vertically integrated business model allows the company to quickly react to the market trends and exploit new opportunities. moreover, the company’s nut roasting facilities and patented glazing technologies provide a self-stable glazed nut for the mass market. also, the company is benefiting from its sustained cost-curtailment endeavors. we believe that the company’s turnaround strategies such as improving price realization, lowering underperforming skus and reducing dependency on discount have placed it on the path to success, as evident from improved margins and earnings results for third-quarter fiscal 2014. additionally, diamond foods is focusing on gaining its lost market share through expansion of the existing product lines and introduction of new products in the

Article 2 - 10 corporations have a monopoly on almost everything you buy at the supermarket
10 corporations have a monopoly on almost everything you buy at the supermarket (before it's news) by vicki batts food and water were once considered to be basic rights, belonging to the individual. sadly, this is no longer the case. the rights to food and water have been sold off to the highest bidder, commercialized and turned into an industry. some might call it the bane of our health and wellness, others just call it big food. big food only sells us their food-like products at prices that make profits. perhaps if this industry was comprised of many small businesses, it wouldn’t be so bad. but, at least in western society, almost all of the food and beverages we buy are owned and operated by just a handful of companies. oxfam, an international confederation of charitable organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty, has created an infographic that illustrates how a small number of corporations have a monopoly on grocery store shelves. a mere ten companies have managed to usurp control of many popular foodstuffs and beverages. this includes nestlé, pepsico, coca-cola, unilever, danone, general mills, kellogg’s, mars, associated british foods and mondelez. each and every one of these companies makes billions of dollars each year in revenue, and have spread their presence across the globe. oxfam has said that it took action and showed people who is controlling the brands of food and beverages that they purchase as

Article 3 - consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews
consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews (before it's news) stocks in the consumer staples sector performed their traditional defensive role as the broader equity markets came under pressure over concerns about the prolonged weak u.s. economy and the debt crisis in europe. shares of consumer staples companies, accounting for a total of about 11.4% of the s&p 500 index, were up 5.3%, compared with a 3.3% drop for the s&p 500. in 2010, the sector index grew 10.7% versus a 12.8% increase for the s&p 500 index. the consumer staples companies are typically able to buck sluggish economic growth as food, beverage, household products and cosmetics companies that manufacture and market non-durable consumables, are considered essential to daily life, such as food, drink, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper, etc. although, staples’ earnings are expected to the continue the uptrend of the last quarters going forward, margins will remain under pressure due to elevated food prices. road ahead as referred to earlier, the macro-economic environment remains uncertain. however, we have seen that product demand has remained relatively stable for the companies that are more exposed to fast-growing emerging markets in comparison to the slow-growing developed markets. moreover, favorable foreign exchange translation and lower production costs in developing markets led to higher operating margins than the u.s. therefore, consumer staples companies have out

shark tank season 4 episode 3 breakdown headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! it was a busy weekend, so i didn’t get to watch shark tank until this evening. so here is the breakdown of season 4 week 3: liz lovely cookies the first company makes gluten-free, diary-free gourmet cookies. there was some dispute among the sharks about if they tasted good or not. the company did $1m in sales last year, 90% from wholesale, and had a 10% profit margin. they wanted to get to $10m in sales and then get bought by a big food company. they were seeking $200k for 10% of the company (a $1.8m pre money valuation). all the sharks but cuban quickly passed. cuban has interest in a gluten free diet, and claimed that he liked the company, but his only concern was valuation. price is always a consideration in investing, but particularly so if the entrepreneurs have shown an interest in an early exit. since an early exit caps the upside potential, getting in at the right, low valuation is necessary to be able to make a high multiple on your investment. many vcs won’t even consider an investment in a company where the founders are expressly looking to exit early. they want to see an opportunity for 10x or even 100x returns. individual investors often don’t have the same return targets, so may be more willing

Article 5 - hounded by evil dollar & collapsed commodity prices, corporate america clamors for total currency war
(before it's news) consumers are feeling practically euphoric. the conference board index jumpedalmost ten points to 102.9, the highest since august 2007, just before the whole construct came apart. not that reality has suddenly improved that much. but hey, we’re born survivors. sooner or later, we adjust to lower real incomes and reduced standards of living and start feeling good again. this exuberance came just as our largest corporate citizens were hit by a tornado of problems that sank the stock market for the day: currency volatility, crashing commodities prices, disappearing xp computers, farmers switching from corn to wheat…. it was all there. freeport-mcmoran, one of the largest copper producers in the world, reported an 11% drop in revenues for the fourth quarter and a salty $$2.85 billion loss, which included $$3.4 billion in losses for its oil and gas business that it got into via two impeccably-timed acquisitions in 2013. the depressed price of copper isn’t helping. it cut its 2015 budget by $$2 billion and might cut it some more. shares dropped 6%. long-suffering peabody energy, the largest coal producer in the us, reported a net loss for the quarter of $$566 million on revenues that declined 3.3%. it projected a much wider loss than expected for the first quarter and cut its dividends to nearly nothing. it’s all about preserving cash and hanging on in a

Article 6 - joe’s jeans: the importance of stability (joez)
joe’s jeans: the importance of stability (joez) (before it's news) joe’s jeans (nasdaq:joez) designs, develops and markets branded clothing through retailers throughout the united states. the company has recently been hitting 52 week lows after the company’s 10-k was released, showing that, while revenues were up 23%, gross margins contracts and eps fell from $$0.40 to $$0.04 (unfortunately, not the result of a non-cash writedown). furthermore, the company swung from cfo of positive 10,599 to negative 4,149 and incurred significantly higher capex demands, leading to a large negative free cash flow for the year. the volatility of this company’s operations stems from its line of business. in the conference call following the earnings release, the company’s ceo, marc crossman, had this to say by way of reasoning for the poor performance: in the fourth quarter, our net sales declined 7% from $$25.2 million to $$23.6 million. the sales decline was entirely attributable to our women’s wholesale business. the domestic women’s wholesale business, which is our largest and mature segment decreased double digits on a year-over-year basis. during the quarter, our consumer looked to new fabrics as a new catalyst for her next purchase. we did not capitalize on this trend with the right offering of cords, pontes, and super-stretch fabrics. we didn’t have

Article 7 - safeway reiterated at neutral – analyst blog
safeway reiterated at neutral – analyst blog % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) we reiterate our neutral recommendation on safeway inc. (swy) with a target price of $$23.00. we note that the retail environment is quite challenging. consumer spending on durable products has been very weak. in the face of economic uncertainty and price competition, safeway has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth over the past few quarters. although the improved id store sales were a reflection of an improved economic scenario, considering the nearly 4.7% retail inflation during the fourth quarter 2011, id store sales effectively declined 3.2% year over year. accordingly, the company’s id store sales guidance for fiscal 2012 was moderate in the growth range of 1–2%. inflation, which is hitting the entire retail industry (largely through food and fuel), will likely dampen sales growth of the overall industry. safeway may find it difficult to pass on increased prices to its customers due to tough competition. this tough scenario has led certain consumers trading down to a less expensive mix of products or searching for discounts on grocery items, which in turn have impacted safeway’s sales. the company expects these difficult economic conditions to persist for a while. the company confronts a wide spectrum of competitive threats, especially from players like supervalu inc.

Article 8 - three non-financial measures that reveal a company’s prospects
three non-financial measures that reveal a company’s prospects (before it's news) daily gains letter publishes daily updates on personal finance, investment strategies and financial planning related topics. william feather said it best: “one of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys, another sells, and both think they are astute.” (source: brainyquote, last accessed april 18, 2013.) a buyer in the stock market usually believes that what they are buying will soar higher, while the sellers think there isn’t any more room to the upside and the stock is bound to go down. reasons to buy or sell can be many, but at the end of the day, what really matters is if you, as an investor, earned any return on your investment or not—losses eat savings and can cause significant delays in achieving your long-term goals. to be on the “right side” or to be able to earn return on the capital you have invested, you need to increase your odds of profitability. you can do this in many ways. first, you can spend rigorous amounts of time researching the company and figuring out its financial standing. similarly, you can also look at the following non-financial performance measures to assess the business you are wishing to invest in. management this is very simple: to run a business efficiently—and be profitable—every business needs a good management team or leaders who can make decisions not only regarding daily operations, but in times

Article 1 - as biggest business, wal-mart propels changes elsewhere
that is an understatement. to keep its prices low, wal-mart is always pushing its suppliers, an army of more than 65,000 companies, to become leaner machines that examine every penny they spend. this ruthless drive to cut fat has clearly reshaped the practices of both businesses that have worked with wal-mart and those that compete against it. the wal-mart hallmarks for keeping costs down -- the use of cutting-edge technology, masterful logistics, reliance on imported goods and a nonunion work force -- are becoming industry standards. those retailers that have failed to keep up have suffered. wal-mart's potentially devastating effect on mom-and-pop businesses has been widely reported, but many in the industry argue that wal-mart is now large enough that it is also driving midsize to large players out of business and speeding consolidation among others. (philip morris's decision to merge the food giants kraft and nabisco into one entity, for example, was seen by many as a way to increase its leverage with retailing giants.) and while wal-mart's business practices are greatly emulated, they are often controversial. as wal-mart accelerates its drive to open stores abroad, local groups have formed to protest the company's practices. labor advocates say overseas factories that supply wal-mart are routinely among those with the worst working conditions. in addition, as wal-mart begins to compete with american businesses that are mostly unionized, labor unions, their members and some

with the specter of another recession, brands like clinique and duwop cosmetics are preparing for a big year in lip color, for two reasons. first, they would like to see a return to lipstick, which usually costs slightly more than gloss. second, the companies believe that in down times women will continue to splurge on lip lacquer even as they make do with last season’s dress. but do economists, and not just companies that need to move a lot of lip color, believe that lipstick sales could skyrocket as the economy tanks? and what’s the draw of lipstick in particular for women worried about having to pay as much for gas as they would a handbag? not only is the lipstick theory plausible, “it’s perfectly consistent with all kinds of economic theory,” said richard dekaser, the chief economist with national city corporation, a financial holding company and bank in cleveland. photo three sorts of products sell robustly during tough times, said lou crandall, the chief economist at wrightson icap, an independent research firm. the first is what economists call traditional inferior goods, what people have to buy when they can no longer afford their favorites. if you’re a salmon lover eating tuna casserole, you’re chewing on inferior goods. advertisement continue reading the main story lipsticks aren’t inferior goods, economists say, but they could be small indulgences, an inexpensive treat meant to substitute for a bigger-ticket item. or lipsticks could also

Article 3 - magical or overrated? a food additive in a swirl
but the country’s big food companies have not exactly embraced dha the way that martek executives figured they would — or should. for several years, the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars increasing its production capacity in anticipation of a deluge of orders that have yet to materialize. makers of infant formula are buying dha in bulk, but last year martek booked barely $500,000 in sales to food companies. the company’s stock closed at $24.17 a share on friday, down 66 percent from its high of $70.99 in may 2004. competition is one reason that martek’s dha has not emerged as the new calcium, which food makers have long sprinkled into various products from orange juice to cereal. (as a result, the average american consumes more calcium, crucial to bone strength, than in the past.) fish oil companies also sell omega-3 fatty acids, as a food additive or in gel capsules (martek sells gel cap versions of its product as well). they promote their products as cheaper, more magical elixirs that are superior to dha because they also have a second important omega-3 called eicosapentaenoic acid, or epa. there are questions about the supposed benefits of dha, whether it is derived from algae or anchovies. the food and drug administration has declared dha safe, but some nutritionists question the sweeping health claims promoted by martek and others that sell omega-3

Article 4 - an inflation indicator leaves the fed in a tough spot
businesses continued to grapple with steep inflation last month as oil and food costs hit record highs, leaving federal reserve policy makers in a difficult spot ahead of their meeting later this month. a gauge of prices paid by american producers jumped 1.1 percent in march, the labor department said on tuesday, sharply accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in february. the increase, led by a surge in gasoline and home heating oil prices, was twice what economists had expected. the higher prices put pressure on businesses to pass on costs to consumers, though some economists said the housing slump and weakening job market could discourage businesses from raising their prices. advertisement continue reading the main story “given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward, it is unlikely that businesses will have as much success raising prices at the consumer level as they did in the not too distant past,” joshua shapiro, an economist at the research firm mfr, wrote in a note to clients.

Article 6 - for clothing makers, it's cut or be cut
but 2001 was different. apparel sales were soft all year; so were prices. as the economy weakened, credit tightened, leaving many manufacturers and wholesalers in a vise. ''there is very little margin for error in this environment,'' said paul charron, the chairman and chief executive of liz claiborne inc., one of the few companies that saw third-quarter revenue and profits improve from last year. ''large, sophisticated retailers are looking to do business with large, sophisticated suppliers. management that has not executed with precision is in big trouble.'' the exact damage to the sector will not be known for a few weeks -- it is in january that retailers sit down with suppliers and demand cash back for those goods sold at discount prices or delivered late or in imperfect condition. the omens, however, began to emerge in late october and november, when the largest apparel makers reported discouraging third-quarter results and hinted that there was far more more bad news to come. the vf corporation, the maker of lee and wrangler jeans and vanity fair lingerie, is laying off 13,000 employees, or 18 percent of its work force. kellwood, the maker of sag harbor, sierra designs and kathie lee gifford's line for wal-mart, said its net earnings for the quarter would decline nearly 50 percent, compared with the period a year earlier, partly because its margins were being squeezed at retail. for the quarter ended in september, donna k

Article 8 - slight growth in economy, but consumer spending weakens
economists suggested that swelling inventories — which grew by $1.8 billion from january to march, after decreasing by $18.3 billion in the previous three months — portends potential trouble in the months ahead: if business does not swiftly improve, allowing factories to sell goods they have piled up, companies are likely to lay off workers at a more aggressive clip, taking more paychecks out of an economy already suffering from a sagging propensity to spend. even if business picks up and orders materialize, averting broader layoffs, factories will probably not need to produce as much in the coming months as they sell off stockpiles, prompting some to trim working hours and purchases of materials. “a big inventory contribution in one quarter means a payback in another quarter,” said zach pandl, united states economist at lehman brothers. “firms are likely to pull back.” the very fact that economic activity expanded as opposed to shrinking challenged the broad assumption that the economy is ensnared in a recession. a government-appointed panel of economists ultimately decides whether a particular patch of trouble qualifies as a recession, which is defined as a “significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months.” “the argument that we’re not in a recession certainly gets a little bit more of a boost from this report,” said jared bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented economic policy institute in washington. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you

Title: what keeps a bottom line healthy? weight loss
Content: industry insiders have a name for the practice: the weight-out. it is a subtle way of earning more from everyday products without scaring off price-conscious shoppers, and it is quite legal as long as the package accurately describes what is inside. makers of candy, coffee and tuna fish have all tried weight-outs, with varying success. but the practice had been relatively scarce since the mid-1990's, largely because the cost of raw materials was low enough that manufacturers could afford to forgo price increases and still preserve the bottom line. now, however, the cost of production is rising -- expenses like energy, packaging, even ink. so weight-outs have slowly begun to resurface as a means of maintaining corporate profits without enraging customers, who are often none the wiser. ''we haven't encountered an environment like this in a long time,'' said emanuel goldman, a food and beverage analyst with ing barings. ''there's more resistance to raising prices than in the past, so you're going to get a lot more of these weight-outs.'' for instance, while holding prices steady, the perrier group, a subsidiary of nestle, has just completed a switch to five gallons from six for home deliveries of poland spring bottled water, a swap it plans for water-cooler jugs of its calistoga brand as well. in september, procter & gamble scaled back the number of disposable diapers in its luvs and pampers packages by an average of 13 percent, while cutting prices only 7 percent. company officials said the change, which, for example, comes out to eight fewer diapers in a jumbo pack that previously had 56, left parents with just enough diapers to get through the week, while providing procter a price increase for each diaper sold. kimberly-clark made a similar change to its huggies diapers almost immediately after procter & gamble acted, prompting makers of many generic diapers to do the same. advertisement continue reading the main story ''everyone in the diaper industry is downsizing to the same count,'' said tami jones, a procter spokeswoman. with consumers increasingly resistant to paying more at the supermarket, conditioned by years of low inflation to expect stable prices on everyday items, some experts predict that other consumer product companies will soon follow suit. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Businesses are adapting to changing market conditions. Walmart, the largest retailer, is pushing suppliers to become leaner machines to keep costs down. This approach has reshaped industry practices and led to consolidation among retailers. The company's business practices have been emulated but also criticized for their impact on labor conditions in overseas factories.

In the cosmetics industry, Clinique and Duwop are preparing for a big year in lip color due to economic uncertainty. Lipstick sales could increase as women splurge on luxury items during tough times. Economists believe that lipstick is not an inferior good, but rather a small indulgence or substitute for a bigger-ticket item.

The food additive DHA has failed to materialize as expected, despite significant investment by Martek. Competition from other omega-3 fatty acids has led to questions about the benefits of DHA and its derivation from algae or anchovies.

Inflation is rising, with prices paid by American producers jumping 1.1% in March. The Federal Reserve faces a difficult spot ahead of its meeting, as businesses may not pass on costs to consumers due to weak demand.

The retail sector is experiencing challenges, with some companies laying off employees and reporting declining profits. Tesco's CEO warns brands not to make UK shoppers pay for weak pound fluctuations.

Economic growth is slight, but consumer spending is weakening. Swelling inventories could lead to potential trouble in the months ahead, as businesses may need to lay off workers or trim working hours.

Article 3 - pindi: busiest lunch spot for tourists and gossip in delhi
pindi: busiest lunch spot for tourists and gossip in delhi (before it's news) no one wants to eat at an empty restaurant. it’s a metaphor for many situations in life. one look around the crowded interior of pindi will show this adage to very true. on any given day shortly before lunchtime a queue forms out the door of pindi. over the years this local delhi restaurant (serving indian and chinese food) has become a favorite among travel guides and tourist drivers who bring hungry clients en mass. it certainly doesn’t hurt to be within close proximity to delhi’s famed india gate and lodi gardens. drivers know to direct their route near pindi as tourists wind their way through the highlights of delhi sightseeing and the lunch hour approaches. billed as a restaurant where guests can get quick service and “safe” food, the reason for their success is not so much in the overpriced food or drab ambiance, rather for the loose lipped gossip that runs from the abundance of foreign travelers. the bland commercial looking storefront of pindi is nothing to get excited about, extending to the slightly worn decor which has suffered somewhat in recent years. a troop of uniformed mustached waiters and a lone host hurriedly seat the waiting line of guests into one of two dining rooms. the apathy of each employee toward foreigners can be seen carried on their shoulders, held at bay with the hopes of good tips from newly arrived tourists who haven’t yet

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! twice a year, in spring and fall, india’s hindus celebrate navratri, a nine-day festival during which they pray each day to a different female deity. navratri culminates in “kanya puja,” or a day of maiden worshiping: every household invites over the young girls of the neighborhood and, led by the father or patriarch, bows before them, washes their feet, prays to them, offers them a specially prepared feast of vegetarian delicacies and showers them with gifts and money. such veneration of women may surprise foreign observers of india, considering the recent epidemic of rapes there and publicity about the everyday harassment that indian women face—lewd gestures, catcalls, groping, and worse. but as shikha dalmia argues, it is precisely the stubborn hold of this prudish culture that has made many indian men so callow. view this article.

Article 5 - as mores evolve, india’s divorced seek second chance
marriage is still, by and large, socially compulsory. but in a measure of the slow churning of indian social mores, divorce and remarriage are slowly gaining acceptability. “in general, it’s no taboo these days,” mr. raina said gamely, and went on to praise the anonymity that big cities in particular offered to those who wanted a fresh start. to get away from clucking tongues and wagging fingers, a divorced man, as mr. raina put it, “just has to change his house. from east delhi to south delhi, he is a new person.” the work of mr. raina’s agency, called the aastha center for remarriage, is not all that countercultural anymore. the matrimonial sections of sunday papers carry advertisements from other marriage bureaus specializing in second-timers. an internet portal was created six months ago, called secondshaadi.com — shaadi being the hindi word for marriage — and already has a database of 25,000 clients. even conventional marriage portals, like shaadi.com, are beginning to see listings from people who want to tie the knot a second time. sunil gangwani, who runs a shaadi.com branch in nagpur, a small provincial city in central india, said about 5 percent of his clients were divorced. divorce rates are difficult to quantify because cases are filed in local courts across the country, but there is anecdotal evidence of a rise. the

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the facts mentioned in the summary. The only minor discrepancy is that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY does not mention Alvin Greene or Rush Limbaugh, but these points do not affect the overall accuracy of the summary. Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY provides a comprehensive and accurate account of the events described in the article.","Hillary Clinton has expressed her frustration with the 2016 election loss, attributing it to Obama's campaign efforts. She suggested mixed messaging was a challenge in her campaign and praised Obama for his economic rescue efforts.

Alvin Greene, a former Democratic Senate candidate, is considering running for president despite flopping in his previous attempt. He called the state party to inquire about the presidential filing fee.

Rush Limbaugh advocates electing a conservative nominee who excites ""we the people"" voters and is feared by elites. He believes Obama has too many skeletons in his closet and should be avoided.

There are increasing rumors within the Democratic Party about potential candidates emerging at the convention, including John Kerry or Joe Biden. Obama has largely stayed out of the campaign, but may begin sending signals to the DNC that a Biden rescue operation would not displease the White House.

Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by a wide margin, which could drop Bernie Sanders further behind in the delegate count. New voter ID laws and other voting changes are affecting voters in several states, including Florida.

Kellyanne Conway shared a story about answering Hillary's concession call on election night, where she was told to wait 15 minutes for Trump to give a concession speech before Clinton declared victory.

Hillary has revived her ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" narrative, this time on behalf of Obama. He is facing criticism for his handling of the Benghazi attack and other foreign policy blunders.

In summary, Hillary Clinton attributes her loss to Obama's campaign efforts, while Alvin Greene considers running for president despite previous failure. Rush Limbaugh advocates electing a conservative nominee, while rumors swirl about potential Democratic candidates emerging at the convention.","Barack Obama is actively supporting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, emphasizing her qualifications and criticizing Donald Trump. Obama has been traveling extensively to help Clinton secure crucial battleground states. Clinton has maintained a narrow lead in national polls, with some surveys showing her ahead by 3 percentage points.

Obama has acknowledged that his former Secretary of State struggles to whip up passion among voters but is urging supporters to donate to her campaign. He has also implicitly chided Clinton for the negative tone of her attacks and tacitly acknowledged his own missteps.

Some analysts have questioned whether Clinton would be a ""Trojan rabbit"" behind Obama, potentially plotting against him. However, others believe she could bring back policy initiatives from her time as Secretary of State.

In North Carolina, both Clinton and Trump are campaigning in the final stretch before the election. A recent poll showed Clinton leading by 3 percentage points among registered voters.

Harry Reid hopes to ensure Democrats' success in the upcoming election, stating that Jeb Bush would be an easy opponent for Clinton to beat. Reid also believes that a woman should run for president, citing her qualities as a leader.

As the election approaches, Americans are being asked who they want to win. Clinton has been urging black voters in North Carolina to vote early and punish Republican officeholders for supporting Trump.

After the election, Obama urged unity, reminding Americans that ""we are americans first"" and encouraged younger generations not to be cynical. He promised a peaceful transition of power and was heartened by his conversation with Trump, who agreed on the importance of unity.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - hillary clinton now blaming obama for election loss
hillary clinton is now pointing her finger at the eight years of former president barack obama as a reason she couldn’t campaign on an “agenda of change” and conceivably win the 2016 election. obama actively campaigned for his former secretary of state throughout the election campaign. in an interview posted wednesday with radio host hugh hewitt, clinton bemoaned being seen as an extension of the obama years. “it is true that when you run to succeed a two-term president of your own party, you have a historical headwind blowing against you,” clinton told hewitt. “it’s not just this campaign can be set apart from everything that’s ever happened in our politics. it is a challenge.” clinton suggested her campaign suffered from mixed messaging. “if you are both the candidate defending a lot of the areas of agreement, but also putting forth an agenda for change, which is what i tried to do, it is often difficult to get the second part of that message through.” not that she wanted to distance herself from obama. “i was proud to serve in the obama administration. i did not agree with everything that president obama decided, but on balance, i really think he did what had to be done to rescue the economy, which as we all remember, was in desperate straits,” clinton said. the former first lady also suggested that she is far from finished with public life. getting into the spirit

doorknob alert: alvin greene might run for president (before it's news) by rj richards the bad thing about some of the “no names” who run for office is that they get addicted to the attention. so instead of riding off into the sunset knowing that they did something that honestly does take courage; they decide to keep running and running and running. it doesn’t matter if they can barely raise two hundred dollars or if they get 1% of the vote, they keep thinking that they’re one step away from a breakthrough. former south carolina democratic senate candidate alivin greene wants to up the ante. he flopped when he ran for the senate, so now he’s going to run for president. yeah, makes sense… from politico: alvin greene might run for president. greene, the unlikely democratic senate nominee in south carolina who lost overwhelmingly to republican sen. jim demint last week, called the state democratic party on tuesday to ask how much it would cost to run for president. “maybe. i’ll have to see,” greene told politico when asked whether he was considering filing to run for president. he confirmed that he called the state party tuesday to ask about the fee. the state party’s spokeswoman, keiana page, confirmed that someone called the party tuesday asking about the presidential filing fee but said that the caller did not identify himself. in 2008, south carolina’s presidential

Article 4 - wsj: hillary clinton may not be the nominee
(before it's news) the strange election year of 2016 just keeps getting stranger… there are increasing rumblings within the party about how a new candidate could emerge at the convention. john kerry, the 2004 nominee, is one possibility. but the most likely scenario is that vice president joe biden—who has said that he regrets “every day” his decision not to run—enters the race. mr. biden would be cast as the white knight rescuing the party, and the nation, from a possible trump presidency. to win over sanders supporters, he would likely choose as his running mate someone like sen. elizabeth warren who is respected by the party’s left wing. where is president obama in all this? so far he has largely stayed out of the campaign, other than to say that he doesn’t believe mrs. clinton compromised national security with her home-brew email server. but with her poll numbers dropping, her legal headaches increasing, the sanders candidacy showing renewed vigor, and donald trump looming as a wrecking ball for the president’s legacy, mr. obama and adviser valerie jarrett might begin sending signals to the democratic national committee and to the vice president that a biden rescue operation wouldn’t displease the white house.

Article 6 - bill clinton, obama’s new ‘secretary of explaining stuff,’ takes show on road
joe raedle / getty images former president bill clinton speaks tuesday at florida international university in miami. president obama has joked that he should appoint former president bill clinton to a new post: “secretary of explaining stuff.” that’s basically the role clinton played at the democratic national convention in telling americans why — in his view — they should give obama another four years in office. now clinton is on the campaign trail in the key battleground state of florida. he’s in orlando today after stumping for obama in miami on tuesday. npr’s greg allen reports that in the speech tuesday, clinton told the miami crowd that the anniversary of the sept. 11 attacks should remind americans that part of being a good citizen means exercising the right to vote. it’s a big issue for democrats this year, who are facing diminished enthusiasm around obama compared with four years ago. there also are new voter id laws and other laws affecting voters in several states, florida among them, which democrats have largely opposed. some of the new laws are embroiled in court battles. “when people try to discourage you from voting, which is happening in a lot of these voter changes all over america, it should redouble your determination to vote,” clinton told the crowd. during the rally at florida international university, obama workers combed through the crowd, working to register voters and sign up volunteers to help

Article 7 - kellyanne conway tells story about hillary’s concession call on election night -
many of us will likely always remember where we were and what we were doing when we realized then-candidate donald trump had beaten democrat hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election, but one trump staffer, in particular, has the memory etched in forever. kellyanne conway, trump’s campaign manager and current white house counselor, was the one who answered the 2:30 a.m. concession phone call from the clinton campaign. at the national review institute’s recent ideas summit in washington, conway reminisced about the special moment and how it played out, according to the u.k. daily mail. the night before the election, conway had spoken with clinton’s team via email about when the concession call would happen if necessary. robby mook, clinton’s campaign manager, agreed the night before that within 15 minutes of the associated press calling the race, clinton would “wait 15 minutes to give her victory speech.” “so he was basically saying that you have 15 minutes for mr. trump to get out there [and give a concession speech] or she’s going to declare victory either way,” conway explained. “and then he said in the event that mr. trump wins, secretary clinton will call him within 15 minutes of the ap,” conway said with a wink, implying that clinton staffers were confident their boss would win. but, when the time came and clinton was declared and the loser,

reviving hillary’s vast right-wing conspiracy (before it's news) remember when bill clinton was still denying his involvement with monica lewinsky, and an indignant hillary went out to face the cameras on his behalf, imagining that his troubles were due to “a vast right-wing conspiracy”? well, fast forward fifteen years and she’s at it again, this time on behalf of her boss, barack obama, the incredible shrinking man who loves to take credit for everything (have you heard that he got osama bin laden?) but finds it impossible to take responsibility for anything (whatever it is, it’s still bush’s fault). following mitt romney’s elegant rope-a-dope of obama in their third and final debate of this election season, during which the republican nominee left the prosecution of the administration’s foreign policy blunders to others during the final days of their race for the white house, the president’s flailing re-election campaign finds itself confronting a whole new set of problems. while relying heavily on the complicity of the mainstream media to aid in a blatant cover-up concerning a planned terrorist attack on the american consulate in benghazi, libya on the anniversary of 9/11, obama has been desperate to run out the clock before voters can learn the truth about his incompetence and deceit. now he must try to explain a newly obtained e-mail message that clearly shows he has been lying all along to the american people about the attack, which killed

Article 1 - you love me? vote for her! obama hits frontline for clinton
washington (afp) - how do you gift your popularity to someone else? as barack obama rolls up his sleeves to ensure hillary clinton succeeds him in the white house, his argument increasingly boils down to a simple message: do it for me. with approval ratings almost unheard of for an outgoing leader -- 54 percent, according to the latest gallup average -- the democratic president is hitting the trail full-time to help clinton lock in crucial battleground states in the final stretch of the race. obama's time this week is devoted almost exclusively to drumming up the vote for his former secretary of state in a marathon that started tuesday in columbus, ohio, heading wednesday to raleigh, north carolina, on to miami and jacksonville, florida on thursday and finally back to north carolina's charlotte on friday. his stump speech is well-rehearsed. it starts with an avalanche of compliments for hillary, summed up thus: ""there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not bill, nobody -- more qualified than hillary clinton to serve as president of the united states of america."" and it includes an arsenal of pointed attacks on her rival donald trump, in a nutshell: ""the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president."" but obama -- who is well aware that clinton struggles to whip up passion in the electorate -- also regularly takes the conversation into more personal territory, linking her political future

Article 2 - clinton wins primary, keeping bid alive
but she quickly put out a call for supporters to donate to her campaign, noting that “we can only keep winning if we can keep competing with an opponent who outspends us so massively.” she urged viewers to visit her web site and “show your support.” amid chants of “yes she can” — a riposte to mr. obama’s motto, “yes we can” — mrs. clinton described herself as “a president who is ready to lead on day one. that means ready to take charge as commander in chief and make this economy work for middle class families, and i thank you, i thank you pennsylvania, for deciding i can be that president.” photo mr. obama congratulated his opponent at a tuesday night rally in evansville, ind. but he also implicitly chided mrs. clinton for the negative tone of her attacks over the past week — and, tacitly, acknowledged his own missteps. “it’s easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit-for-tat that consumes our politics, the bickering that none of us are entirely immune to,” he said. “that trivializes the profound issues — two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril.” he added that americans “believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics.” looking to capitalize on mrs. clinton’s performance in pennsylvania, her campaign spent t

Article 3 - is she a trojan rabbit?
he might also neglect to give bill (whose acronym would be slotus, second lad of the united states) full white house access. aside from the delight bill would get from living at the naval observatory and having a huge telescope to window-peep with, there wouldn’t be much joy in hillaryland. the lady-in-waiting would be surrounded by obama disciples who disdained her for fighting dirty. and she would be miserable holding up the train of the young prince who usurped her dream, derailing the post-nup she had with bill to trade places. as de facto veep for bill, she had enough leverage over him, due to his shenanigans, to co-opt huge chunks of policy and personnel decisions. photo but in a return engagement with obama at the top, could she really wake up every day in the back seat and wish him well, or would she just be plotting? (fourteen vice presidents have ascended, after all.) wouldn’t she be, in monty python parlance, the trojan rabbit behind the gates? on a positive note, maybe she could bring back all that stuff she pilfered on her way out. obama’s other option, laid out by teddy kennedy on friday, is to go with someone who wouldn’t be a big dark cloud over his sunshiny new politics. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email

Article 4 - crowds shower president with the star treatment
mr. clinton may well be a detested figure in some parts of the country. and he may well turn off swing voters and energize the republican base, as the gore campaign has calculated. but none of that was on display yesterday as mr. clinton stuck to solidly democratic turf -- ''i'm preaching to the saved,'' he noted at one point -- while trying to boost the fortunes of al gore's presidential campaign and hillary rodham clinton's senate bid. ''why are new yorkers so fanatically loyal to president clinton?'' fernando ferrer, the bronx borough president and likely mayoral candidate, asked in introducing the president. ''the answer is simple: for the first time in my lifetime, there has been someone in the white house who has felt comfortable with people like us.'' others seemed to agree. the focus was supposed to be on mr. gore and mrs. clinton, both of whom are locked in tight races, but the democrats who turned out yesterday could not help repeatedly invoking the name of mr. clinton. ''you can't help but love the guy,'' said tecala t. hall, a social worker and democratic activist.

by emily stephenson and amanda becker | miami/phoenix democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump head to north carolina on thursday in a final effort to shore up support in the swing state as two polls showed clinton maintaining a narrow lead nationally just days ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election. the surveys by the new york times/cbs and the washington post/abc echoed other national polls that have shown clinton with a slimmer lead over trump since the re-emergence last week of a controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of state. clinton led by 3 percentage points among 1,333 registered voters in the times/cbs poll taken oct. 28-nov. 1. the federal bureau of investigation announced on oct. 28 that it was reviewing a new batch of emails that might be related to her email practices. the survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, showed clinton with 45 percent support compared to 42 percent for trump, according to the times. “about six in 10 voters over all said that the 11th-hour disclosures about each candidate would make no real difference in their vote,” the times said. there were also strong differences by gender, with more women supporting clinton and trump leading among men. more detailed results from the poll were expected later on thursday. separately, a washington post/abc poll showed clinton

Article 6 - harry reid hopes to ensure democrats’ success as tenure winds down
throughout the lunch, mr. reid fired off the kind of observations that have, for better and worse, marked his soon-to-end career in washington. jeb bush, the florida republican expected to run for president, would be the “easiest opponent” for hillary rodham clinton to beat in 2016, mr. reid said. “he’d have to wake up every morning and find out what he’s for,” mr. reid said. not to mention the record of president george w. bush. “how can his brother jeb get away from that?” mr. reid said. “i’ll take clinton baggage over that any day.” he said president obama wasted 18 months in his first term trying to accommodate political intransigence from republicans, but suggested the president would nevertheless be remembered as the best chief executive in at least 50 years, presumably including bill clinton, the husband of the woman likely to be the 2016 democratic presidential nominee. he called mrs. clinton, the secretary of state under mr. obama, the obvious favorite to win the presidency, for one overwhelming reason: “this is the time for a woman to run.” “women and some men, like me, if they are anything like me,” he said, “they have come to the realization that women have qualities that we’ve been lacking in america for a long time, to be the leader of the country.” “

Article 7 - who do you want to win the 2016 presidential election?
photo the presidential primaries, party conventions and televised debates are all over. in fact, early voting is already underway in many states. with only two weeks left until election day, we’re in the homestretch of what the times has called “the most surreal presidential campaign in modern times.” in the many student opinion questions we’ve already published during this election cycle, we’ve asked you what issues you care about most. we asked if you thought america was headed in the right direction. now it’s time to ask: who do you want to be the next president of the united states? tell us in the comments, and be sure to explain why. meanwhile, the two campaigns press forward. alexander burns and amy chozick reported on a clinton campaign event on sunday: hillary clinton moved aggressively on sunday to press her advantage in the presidential race, urging black voters in north carolina to vote early and punish republican officeholders for supporting donald j. trump, even as mr. trump’s party increasingly concedes he is unlikely to recover in the polls. aiming to turn her edge over mr. trump into an unbreakable lead, mrs. clinton has been pleading with core democratic constituencies to get out and vote in states where balloting has already begun. by running up a lead well in advance of the nov. 8 election in states like north carolina and florida, she could virtually eliminate mr. trump’s ability to make a late comeback. and ash

Article 8 - obama urges unity after election day: 'we are americans first'
washington ― president barack obama reminded a stunned nation on wednesday morning that people across the country “are americans first” and encouraged younger generations to not be “cynical.” obama stood in the white house rose garden to deliver remarks hours after donald trump was declared the president-elect of the united states. obama, who said he had spoken to trump on wednesday morning, promised to make the transition between his administration and trump’s as seamless as possible. “everybody is sad when their side loses an election. but the day after, we have to remember we’re actually all on one team,” obama said. “this is an intramural scrimmage. we are americans first; we are patriots first.” a peaceful transition is key, obama said, because everyone is now “rooting for [trump’s] success in uniting and leading the country.” “a peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy, and over the next few months we are going to show that to the world,” he said. everybody is sad when their side loses an election. but the day after, we have to remember we’re actually all on one team. this is an intramural scrimmage. president barack obama obama said he was “heartened” by his conversation with trump, who agreed that unity was important after such a bitter election cycle. “that’s what the country needs,” obama said. “a

Title: you love me? vote for her! barack obama hits frontline for hillary clinton | zee news
Content: you love me? vote for her! barack obama hits frontline for hillary clinton last updated: wednesday, november 2, 2016 - 22:31 0 follow @zeenews washington: how do you gift your popularity to someone else? as barack obama rolls up his sleeves to ensure hillary clinton succeeds him in the white house, his argument increasingly boils down to a simple message: do it for me. with approval ratings almost unheard of for an outgoing leader -- 54 percent, according to the latest gallup average -- the democratic president is hitting the trail full-time to help clinton lock in crucial battleground states in the final stretch of the race. obama`s time this week is devoted almost exclusively to drumming up the vote for his former secretary of state in a marathon that started tuesday in columbus, ohio, heading wednesday to raleigh, north carolina, on to miami and jacksonville, florida on thursday and finally back to north carolina`s charlotte on friday. his stump speech is well-rehearsed. it starts with an avalanche of compliments for hillary, summed up thus: ""there has never been a man or a woman -- not me, not bill, nobody -- more qualified than hillary clinton to serve as president of the united states of america."" and it includes an arsenal of pointed attacks on her rival donald trump, in a nutshell: ""the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president."" but obama -- who is well aware that clinton struggles to whip up passion in the electorate -- also regularly takes the conversation into more personal territory, linking her political future to his own legacy. ""i ask you to do for hillary clinton what you did for me. i ask you to carry her the same way you carried me,"" he urged supporters in his address to the democratic national convention in july. a few weeks later, america`s first black president went further by urging african americans to mobilize for clinton -- telling them he would ""consider it a personal insult"" if they fail to rally this time around.black voters traditionally lean heavily democratic in the united states -- and more than 90 percent voted for obama in 2008 and 2012. the crucial question facing the 69-year-old clinton is whether she can draw anywhere near the historic turnout levels among black voters seen for obama. and so the president is flooding the airwaves in the homestretch of the race, hammering home the point wednesday morning on the tom joyner morning show, a radio program whose audience is largely african american. obama cited the data coming in from early voting states, and issued a wake-up call: ""i`m going to be honest with you,"" he said. ""the latino vote is up. overall vote is up. but the african-american vote right now is not as solid as it needs to be."" it

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Barack Obama is actively supporting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, emphasizing her qualifications and criticizing Donald Trump. Obama has been traveling extensively to help Clinton secure crucial battleground states. Clinton has maintained a narrow lead in national polls, with some surveys showing her ahead by 3 percentage points.

Obama has acknowledged that his former Secretary of State struggles to whip up passion among voters but is urging supporters to donate to her campaign. He has also implicitly chided Clinton for the negative tone of her attacks and tacitly acknowledged his own missteps.

Some analysts have questioned whether Clinton would be a ""Trojan rabbit"" behind Obama, potentially plotting against him. However, others believe she could bring back policy initiatives from her time as Secretary of State.

In North Carolina, both Clinton and Trump are campaigning in the final stretch before the election. A recent poll showed Clinton leading by 3 percentage points among registered voters.

Harry Reid hopes to ensure Democrats' success in the upcoming election, stating that Jeb Bush would be an easy opponent for Clinton to beat. Reid also believes that a woman should run for president, citing her qualities as a leader.

As the election approaches, Americans are being asked who they want to win. Clinton has been urging black voters in North Carolina to vote early and punish Republican officeholders for supporting Trump.

After the election, Obama urged unity, reminding Americans that ""we are americans first"" and encouraged younger generations not to be cynical. He promised a peaceful transition of power and was heartened by his conversation

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Hillary Clinton has expressed her frustration with the 2016 election loss, attributing it to Obama's campaign efforts. She suggested mixed messaging was a challenge in her campaign and praised Obama for his economic rescue efforts.

Alvin Greene, a former Democratic Senate candidate, is considering running for president despite flopping in his previous attempt. He called the state party to inquire about the presidential filing fee.

Rush Limbaugh advocates electing a conservative nominee who excites ""we the people"" voters and is feared by elites. He believes Obama has too many skeletons in his closet and should be avoided.

There are increasing rumors within the Democratic Party about potential candidates emerging at the convention, including John Kerry or Joe Biden. Obama has largely stayed out of the campaign, but may begin sending signals to the DNC that a Biden rescue operation would not displease the White House.

Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by a wide margin, which could drop Bernie Sanders further behind in the delegate count. New voter ID laws and other voting changes are affecting voters in several states, including Florida.

Kellyanne Conway shared a story about answering Hillary's concession call on election night, where she was told to wait 15 minutes for Trump to give a concession speech before Clinton declared victory.

Hillary has revived her ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" narrative, this time on behalf of Obama. He is facing criticism for his handling of the Benghazi attack and other foreign policy blunders.

In summary, Hillary Clinton attributes her loss to Obama's campaign

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the facts mentioned in the reliable news summary. The article also mentions specific details, such as the Paris Agreement and the Trump administration's environmental nominees, which are supported by the reliable news summary. Overall, the article presents a balanced view of climate change, highlighting its severity and the need for immediate attention, without sensationalizing or distorting facts.","Climate change and environmental issues are prominent topics in these articles. A study by the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute found that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall, are increasing due to climate change. The same study also noted that cold events should not be mistaken for evidence against global warming.

Another article highlights unintended consequences of environmental actions, citing a study that shows cleaning up pollutants in the Atlantic Ocean has led to warmer seas, which can fuel hurricanes like Katrina. This is contrary to previous claims that reducing pollution would mitigate hurricane severity.

A report on massive methane releases off the coast of Los Angeles and Jamaica suggests that tectonic plate movement may be causing these events. The article also mentions the potential for future crises, such as economic collapse or geophysical upheaval.

The weather modification and geoengineering industry is exposed in an article, which lists various companies and research organizations involved in this field. The article aims to debunk claims of ""tinfoil hat"" conspiracy theories.

California has declared a state of emergency due to a massive tree die-off, which is attributed to beetles and exacerbated by four years of drought conditions. The article also mentions climate engineering as a potential cause of the issue.

A leaked draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that human activities are the main cause of global warming since the 1950s, with an estimated 95% likelihood. This is up from previous reports which estimated lower probabilities.

Finally, an article discusses the potential for financial Armageddon, citing a report by the IMF and World Bank stating that the United States is officially bankrupt. The article also mentions the risk of global toxic derivatives and the possibility of a new economic crisis.","Climate change is a pressing global issue, with devastating consequences such as melting glaciers, forest fires, and extreme weather events. Despite the growing evidence, many politicians and media outlets have failed to address the issue seriously.

The US has taken a backseat in international climate talks, with Japan playing a pivotal role. The Kyoto treaty, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is at risk of being derailed due to opposition from industries and some politicians.

The Paris Agreement, signed last year, sets goals for global climate action, including limiting temperature increases to well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial norms. However, the agreement's implementation has been slow, with many countries failing to meet their commitments.

Climate change is also having a significant impact on coastal communities and oceans, with sea-level rise and increased storm intensity becoming more frequent. The US has seen devastating effects, including Superstorm Sandy, which caused over $70 billion in economic damage.

The Trump administration's environmental nominees have been questioned about climate change science, with some denying its validity. Despite this, the administration has issued a report confirming that human activities are causing the planet to warm.

International talks on climate change have resulted in vague commitments and promises, rather than concrete goals or action plans. Experts have expressed disappointment with the lack of progress, citing the need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.

Overall, the facts suggest that climate change is a pressing global issue that requires immediate attention and action from governments, industries, and individuals around the world.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - the silence on global warming
exclusive: harrowing predictions of climate scientists are coming true, as glaciers melt, forests burn, heat waves proliferate and freakish weather strikes in unexpected places. but the propagandists of global-warming denial have succeeded in silencing most politicians and the mainstream press, writes robert parry. by robert parry something called a “derecho” a fast-moving line of thunderstorms strikes the washington area knocking out power for days. massive forest fires ravage colorado. a record heat wave covers much of the country. the u.s. press treats these events as major stories, but two words are rarely mentioned: “global warming.” what has become most striking about the growing evidence that climate change is a clear and present danger indeed an emerging existential threat is the simultaneous failure of the u.s. news media to deal seriously with the issue, another sign of how the right can intimidate the mainstream into going silent. we have seen this pattern before, as the right sets the media agenda by bullying those who threaten its ideological interests. before the iraq war, anyone who dared raise questions about the bush administration’s justifications could expect to be marginalized or worse. just ask phil donahue, scott ritter and the dixie chicks. during ronald reagan’s presidency, his hard-nosed propagandists dubbed this tactic “controversializing,” that is, anyone who got too much in the way could expect to be subjected to systematic smears and professional deconstruction. with

Article 3 - u.s. is taking a back seat in latest talks on climate
japan plays a pivotal role. under the complex arithmetic of the treaty, it takes effect only when it is ratified by countries accounting for 55 percent of gas that industrial countries emitted in 1990. without the united states, almost any combination of nations can reach that level only if japan goes along. public opinion in japan is strongly in favor of the kyoto treaty, which was drafted on japanese soil in 1997. but industries there have intensively lobbied against it in recent weeks, japanese officials said, partly fearing that they would incur costs not shared by american industries if the pollution rules took effect. ''our government thinks that it is extremely important to have one international rule and that every country should act,'' said a senior japanese environmental official. ''participation by the u.s.a. is very, very important,'' he said. japanese officials have met three times with the bush administration since mid-september to discuss climate change, but not ways to make the treaty acceptable to the united states, officials from both governments said. mr. bush and many senators have said that the kyoto protocol would harm the economy and unfairly require only the industrial nations to cut emissions, while fast-growing developing countries like china face no such constraints. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new

Article 4 - five crucial things to watch for at the marrakech climate summit
hundreds of international negotiators will convene in marrakech, morocco, next week to kick off a two-week marathon of meetings on how nations will implement the paris agreement to avert catastrophic climate change, which goes into force on friday, nov. 4. they will be hammering out the details of the landmark climate treaty achieved last year in paris, which set several important goals for global climate action. in paris, the world agreed to keep the average global temperature increase to “well below” 3.6 degrees fahrenheit (2 degrees celsius) above preindustrial norms, and as close as possible to 2.7 degrees (1.5 degrees celsius). to get there, 192 nations—rich and poor, developed and developing (and somewhere along the continuum in between)—agreed to restrict heat-trapping carbon pollution over the next several decades to “net zero,” keeping emissions at or below the capacity of ecosystems such as forests and oceans to absorb them and technological advances to store them. given that the average global temperature has already risen by around 1.8 degrees f, many observers felt the paris agreement was more than a little late in coming. but to the surprise and delight of its supporters, a surge of national ratifications in the past 10 months means that the agreement goes into effect just ahead of the nov. 7 start of the marrakech meeting. it’s a remarkably speedy adoption for a complex international treaty, said

nicholas kamm | afp | getty images house speaker paul ryan listens to us president-elect donald trump speak to the press at the capitol in washington, dc, on november 10, 2016. unified republican control of the federal government over the next two years augurs a sea change in us environmental policy like nothing since the late 1960s and '70s, when america's landmark environmental laws were first passed. if donald trump and the gop actually follow through on what they've promised, this time around will be a lurch in the opposite direction. federal climate policy will all but disappear; participation in international environmental or climate treaties will end; pollution regulations will be reversed, frozen in place, or not enforced; clean energy research, development, and deployment assistance will decline; protections for sensitive areas and ecosystems will be lifted; federal leasing of fossil fuels will expand and accelerate; new supreme court appointees will crack down on epa discretion. some of these moves will be easy for trump and republicans in congress to pull off. others will be harder: senate democrats and environmental groups in court will fight them tooth and nail, as they did during the reagan and bush years. but there's no escaping the fact that the gop is in a strong position to demolish and reshape the regime of environmental protection that has been built up over the past 50 years. more from vox: donald trump's presidency will be like donald

mentions of mandatory restrictions on emissions were carefully framed. caps or taxes were endorsed where “national circumstances” made those acceptable. the statement urged nations to set “midterm, aspirational goals for energy efficiency.” there were new commitments to demonstrate that carbon dioxide from coal combustion could be captured, compressed, and stashed permanently underground. but experts have said that process would have to work at the scale of billions of tons of carbon dioxide a year within a decade or two to avert a huge rise in carbon dioxide concentrations, while proposed projects are all measured in millions of tons. the group of 8 statement also pledged to increase aid to help developing countries improve energy efficiency or cut their vulnerability to climate risk. but developing countries have noted that in the past those pledges have gone unfilled. “i would characterize this outcome as ‘talking the talk’ rather then ‘walking the walk’ on climate change policy,” said michael e. schlesinger, a climatologist at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, who has co-written many papers on climate policy. dr. schlesinger and others said that neither this week’s statements nor the two previous climate treaties seemed likely to significantly slow the rise over decades of heat-trapping gases, most notably carbon dioxide — an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Climate change and environmental issues are prominent topics in these articles. A study by the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute found that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall, are increasing due to climate change. The same study also noted that cold events should not be mistaken for evidence against global warming.

Another article highlights unintended consequences of environmental actions, citing a study that shows cleaning up pollutants in the Atlantic Ocean has led to warmer seas, which can fuel hurricanes like Katrina. This is contrary to previous claims that reducing pollution would mitigate hurricane severity.

A report on massive methane releases off the coast of Los Angeles and Jamaica suggests that tectonic plate movement may be causing these events. The article also mentions the potential for future crises, such as economic collapse or geophysical upheaval.

The weather modification and geoengineering industry is exposed in an article, which lists various companies and research organizations involved in this field. The article aims to debunk claims of ""tinfoil hat"" conspiracy theories.

California has declared a state of emergency due to a massive tree die-off, which is attributed to beetles and exacerbated by four years of drought conditions. The article also mentions climate engineering as a potential cause of the issue.

A leaked draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests that human activities are the main cause of global warming since the 1950s, with an estimated 95% likelihood. This is up from previous reports which estimated lower probabilities.

Finally, an article discusses

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Climate change is a pressing global issue, with devastating consequences such as melting glaciers, forest fires, and extreme weather events. Despite the growing evidence, many politicians and media outlets have failed to address the issue seriously.

The US has taken a backseat in international climate talks, with Japan playing a pivotal role. The Kyoto treaty, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is at risk of being derailed due to opposition from industries and some politicians.

The Paris Agreement, signed last year, sets goals for global climate action, including limiting temperature increases to well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial norms. However, the agreement's implementation has been slow, with many countries failing to meet their commitments.

Climate change is also having a significant impact on coastal communities and oceans, with sea-level rise and increased storm intensity becoming more frequent. The US has seen devastating effects, including Superstorm Sandy, which caused over $70 billion in economic damage.

The Trump administration's environmental nominees have been questioned about climate change science, with some denying its validity. Despite this, the administration has issued a report confirming that human activities are causing the planet to warm.

International talks on climate change have resulted in vague commitments and promises, rather than concrete goals or action plans. Experts have expressed disappointment with the lack of progress, citing the need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change.

Overall, the facts suggest that climate change is a pressing global issue that requires immediate attention

The summary also correctly mentions the US-backed alliance of Syrian armed groups' offensive on Raqqa, the establishment of an air hub by Russia, and the criticism from world leaders regarding Obama's failures in the Middle East.

President Obama is mentioned as planning to address Congress and the public about his decision to launch an offensive against ISIS.

The US government has been accused of incompetence in handling foreign policy, with critics arguing that reality is at odds with administration biases. The president has been quoted as saying that a militant group is like a ""JV"" team wearing Lakers uniforms, implying that they are not a significant threat.

ISIS has been making gains in Iraq and Syria, with the US providing military support. However, some experts argue that the US foreign policy in Syria is ""sleepwalking to another Mideast disaster,"" suggesting that the current approach may not be effective.

There is evidence of Islamic extremist groups operating in Mexico, planning to attack the US border with car bombs or other vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The US government has issued a warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack on the border.

Neoconservatives are pushing for the US military to recommit itself to supporting their goals in the Middle East. However, some experts question why the mainstream US news media gives so much attention and credence to these groups, who laid the foundations for previous disasters.

Overall, the articles suggest that the US government's actions and policies regarding terrorism are complex and multifaceted, with various stakeholders having different opinions on how to address the issue.","US President Barack Obama has authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against ISIS in the Middle East, including airstrikes in Syria and the deployment of 475 more military advisers to Iraq. He emphasized that eradicating ISIS is a long-term challenge that will put some American troops at risk.

The Syrian government has been supportive of President Bashar al-Assad's rule, while Sunnis in Iraq have protested against the treatment of newly arriving Syrian refugees. The US-backed alliance of Syrian armed groups announced the kickoff of an offensive on Raqqa, ISIS's de facto capital in Syria, but it is unlikely to pierce the city itself before Obama leaves office.

Jihadists abroad say they will use Donald Trump's election and appointments as a recruitment tool, pushing their claims that the West and Islam are heading toward a clash of civilizations. Russia has established an air hub in Syria, with a prefabricated building capable of housing 2,000 military advisers and personnel.

World leaders have increasingly pointed to Obama's failures in the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Egypt. They argue that US interference has led to the empowerment of Islamists, followed by chaos, conflict, and atrocities.

US airstrikes against ISIS have expanded into Syria, with a focus on isolating the group's stronghold in Raqqa.

Article 1 - obama, in speech on isis, promises sustained effort to rout militants
video washington — president obama on wednesday authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against rampaging sunni militants in the middle east, including american airstrikes in syria and the deployment of 475 more military advisers to iraq. but he sought to dispel fears that the united states was embarking on a repeat of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. in a speech to the nation from the state floor of the white house, mr. obama said the united states was recruiting a global coalition to “degrade and ultimately destroy” the militants, known as the islamic state in iraq and syria. he warned that “eradicating a cancer” like isis was a long-term challenge that would put some american troops at risk. “we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,” mr. obama declared in a 14-minute address. “that means i will not hesitate to take action against isil in syria, as well as iraq,” he added, using an alternative name for isis. “this is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten america, you will find no safe haven.” the president drew a distinction between the military action he was ordering and the two wars begun by his predecessor, george w. bush. he likened this campaign to the selective airstrikes that the united states has carried out for years against suspected terrorists in yemen and somalia, few of which have been made public.

Article 2 - syrian refugees are stung by a hostile reception in iraq
the shiite-dominated government of prime minister nuri kamal al-maliki in iraq, while officially neutral, has been supportive of president bashar al-assad of syria, whose ruling alawite sect is an offshoot of shiite islam. last week, for instance, iraq abstained from supporting a resolution by the arab league calling for mr. assad to step down, calling it unwarranted interference in syria’s internal affairs. though syrians have been fleeing the unrest in their country for months, iraq did not open its borders to refugees until last week, after protests from the sunni tribes in anbar province. the bukamal border crossing, near this city, is the most problematic one for iraq, with the syrian side now under the control of opposition forces. photo the restrictions baghdad has imposed on refugees proved so severe that on friday, representatives of the anbar tribes and hundreds of followers took to the streets in the 125-degree midday heat to protest the treatment of the newly arriving syrians, many of whom have family and tribal connections with iraqis here. “we can’t even go see them,” said mohamed hassan, an iraqi sheik who took part in the protest. like many others, mr. hassan complained that the refugees were being treated like criminals, kept under military guard in 11 school buildings and one mosque and denied any visitors or permission to

Article 3 - trump arouses syrian rebel concern, ""cautious"" optimism in damascus
12:51pm gmt trump arouses syrian rebel concern, ""cautious"" optimism in damascus rebel fighters drive their motorcycles, western aleppo city, syria november 3, 2016. reuters/ammar abdullah by tom perry and lisa barrington | beirut beirut donald trump's election as u.s. president on wednesday drew concern among syrian rebel groups and a degree of optimism in damascus, where his victory was seen as a better outcome than a hillary clinton win. syrian rebels have long been fiercely critical of what they perceive as the obama administration's inadequate backing for their fight against president bashar al-assad, though washington has been an important sponsor of the uprising. but trump's statements on syria, and his more open-minded stance towards assad's ally russia, have fuelled rebel concern about the policy he may adopt on syria's conflict, in which the russian air force has been bombing insurgents. ""i think things will become difficult because of trump's statements and his relationship with putin and russia. i imagine this is not good for the syrian issue,"" zakaria malahifji, head of the political office of an aleppo-based rebel group, told reuters. the syrian opposition says obama failed to back them adequately after calling for assad to leave power, failing to enforce his own ""red line"" against the use of chemical weapons and blocking the

Article 4 - obama unlikely to see assault on islamic state's syria stronghold
by jonathan landay and phil stewart washington (reuters) - a u.s.-backed assault on raqqa, islamic state's de facto capital in syria, is unlikely to pierce the city itself before president barack obama leaves office in january, denying him the chance to claim the end of the group's ""caliphate"" as part of his legacy. although a u.s.-backed alliance of syrian armed groups announced the kickoff of the offensive on sunday, u.s. officials caution the fighters will first try to seal off and isolate the islamic state stronghold, a process that could take two months or longer. as a result, the victor of tuesday's u.s. presidential election almost certainly will inherit the job of routing the militants from the city from which they have run their shrinking territories in syria and iraq, overseen branches from west africa to south asia and plotted attacks in western europe and elsewhere. ""there is no available force capable of taking raqqa in the near future,"" said one u.s. official. another said some of the needed arab forces were still in training. like seven other officials interviewed for this report, they requested anonymity to discuss the issue. u.s. marine general joseph dunford, the top u.s. military officer, played down the idea that seizing raqqa would be quick or easy, saying the first job was sealing off the city. ""we always advertised that the isolation

Article 5 - for jihadists, trump election brings a change in strategy
jihadists abroad say they will use donald trump’s election and appointments as powerful recruitment tool, pushing their claims that the west and islam are heading toward a clash of civilizations. this represents a pivot in strategy. for two decades, jihadists have largely used united states actions ­– such as wars and foreign policy – to support claims of an anti-islam agenda. now, they are anticipating that they will be able to use the words of administration officials themselves. a single tweet, insiders say, can be as big a recruitment boon as the iraq war. “for years we have focused on the palestinian occupation, america’s deceitful alliance with iran and [syrian president] bashar [al-assad] in the slaughter of sunnis in syria and the wars in iraq and afghanistan as proof that america, and americans, are waging a war against islam,” says abu omar, the nom de guerre of an al qaeda operative in syria aligned with the militant group jabhat fatah al-sham. “now all we have to do is turn to trump’s twitter account or turn on cnn.” recommended: how much do you know about terrorism? take the quiz. al qaeda, and likely the islamic state, say they will attempt to convince muslims living in the west that they are no longer welcome in their own society. they will depict jihadists as the sole protector of muslims’ interests. as

Article 6 - russian buildup in syria raises questions on role
at the white house’s direction, mr. carter began a dialogue friday with mr. shoigu aimed at ensuring that american and russian aircraft avoid unintended incidents as they operate over syria. while mr. kerry did not provide details, an american official, who requested anonymity because he was discussing intelligence reports, said that a russian sa-22 air defense system was already in place at latakia. the united states had observed elements of the system at the base in the last week, but now the launcher and the missiles it fires are there, too, the official said. the american official added that the four su-27 aircraft russia had flown to the air base were armed with air-to-air missiles. “what’s the air-to-air threat there for them?” asked the official, who called the development “troubling.” other american officials suggested, however, that the deployment might simply reflect the russian military’s standard defensive precautions as it established an air hub in a foreign country. the prefabricated building russia has erected at the base now has the capacity to house 2,000 military advisers and personnel. ferrying weapons and equipment to the base has involved well over 20 flights by russian condor transport planes — almost all of which have flown to syria by passing over iran and iraq. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to

Article 8 - world leaders lambast obama's 'failures' in the middle east
world leaders are increasingly pointing to u.s. president obama's failures in the middle east. some are direct and blunt. for example, during his recent visit to brazil, russian president vladimir putin was asked by journalists about u.s. sanctions against russia due to the ukrainian crisis. while naturally condemning such moves, part of his response was to accuse the obama administration of ""encouraging war between neighboring states."" in the same context, putin added: american objectives have not been realized, nor have they accomplished anything, because everything has collapsed. afghanistan faces problems, and iraq and libya are falling apart. egypt also was going to collapse had president sisi not taken matters in hand. and all this demonstrates the failures of the obama administration. in fact, and as i have pointed out in several articles, every muslim nation the u.s. has interfered in-whether to promote ""democracy,"" as in the much ballyhooed ""arab spring,"" or to defeat ""terrorism"" and/or eliminate ""wmds""-has seen two results: the empowerment of islamists, followed by chaos, conflict, and constant atrocities. other leaders, such as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, indirectly point to the obama administration's failures in the middle east. this occurred during an interview on nbc's meet the press, in the context of the presbyterian church of the usa's recent decision

Title: romney: obama's 'mistakes' have allowed isis to grow
Content: (photo: reuters/shannon stapleton) u.s. republican presidential nominee mitt romney waves after his concession speech during his election night rally in boston, massachusetts november 7, 2012. former massachusetts governor and 2012 republican presidential nominee mitt romney slammed president barack obama on sunday for not taking any action after receiving intelligence regarding the rise isis in syria over a year ago. romney told john catsimatidis on his radio show on wnym in new york, called the cats roundtable, that had obama acted upon intelligence reports that highlighted a strong presence of varying jihadist rebel terrorist groups' efforts in syria, it could have prevented groups like isis from seizing cities in iraq, a country the united states fought to liberate for over a decade. ""those mistakes were made and now we have isis. almost a year ago, american intelligence sources told the president that there was a group forming called isis … and there was significant chance that they would go into iraq and invade a city there,"" romney said. ""the president failed to take action. he watched. we saw isis roll into iraq. instead of attacking them immediately and not knocking them in their convoy, when it would have been easy to knock down, the president again watched. now we are in a position where isis has run throughout major portions of iraq. there have been horrific human rights abuses, tragedies including those upon american journalists. now we are in a difficult position."" fox news confirmed on tuesday through an anonymous former pentagon official that obama was given a detailed intelligence about the rise of the islamic state in presidential daily briefings last year before the jihadist group seized large amounts of territory. romney, who has adamantly said he is not running for president in 2016 but is still believed to be considering that option, pointed out that if america had voted him into office in the 2012 election he would have taken much more direct action to combat the territorial spread of isis, starting from when they were making headway in syria, to help moderate revolutionaries' revolt against the government led by president bashar al-assad. ""i laid out what i thought was a pretty good course for us to see stability in syria. had we followed that course, there is a good chance that we would not see an isis today,"" romney said. ""that course was to bring together the moderate revolutionaries that were in syria to make sure they were well armed. to assure the alawites that there would be a future in syria post assad. these kind of actions would have stabilized syria, at least i believe so. it would have prevented the growth of a group like isis."" romney also said that it is ""unacceptable"" to see such a major geographical and economical area like iraq being controlled by groups of radical jihadists. but in the last year,

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
US President Barack Obama has authorized a major expansion of the military campaign against ISIS in the Middle East, including airstrikes in Syria and the deployment of 475 more military advisers to Iraq. He emphasized that eradicating ISIS is a long-term challenge that will put some American troops at risk.

The Syrian government has been supportive of President Bashar al-Assad's rule, while Sunnis in Iraq have protested against the treatment of newly arriving Syrian refugees. The US-backed alliance of Syrian armed groups announced the kickoff of an offensive on Raqqa, ISIS's de facto capital in Syria, but it is unlikely to pierce the city itself before Obama leaves office.

Jihadists abroad say they will use Donald Trump's election and appointments as a recruitment tool, pushing their claims that the West and Islam are heading toward a clash of civilizations. Russia has established an air hub in Syria, with a prefabricated building capable of housing 2,000 military advisers and personnel.

World leaders have increasingly pointed to Obama's failures in the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Egypt. They argue that US interference has led to the empowerment of Islamists, followed by chaos, conflict, and atrocities.

US airstrikes against ISIS have expanded into Syria, with a focus on isolating the group's stronghold in Raqqa. The deployment of more military advisers to Iraq aims to support the fight against ISIS.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of articles discuss the US government's actions and policies regarding terrorism, particularly ISIS. President Obama is mentioned as planning to address Congress and the public about his decision to launch an offensive against ISIS.

The US government has been accused of incompetence in handling foreign policy, with critics arguing that reality is at odds with administration biases. The president has been quoted as saying that a militant group is like a ""JV"" team wearing Lakers uniforms, implying that they are not a significant threat.

ISIS has been making gains in Iraq and Syria, with the US providing military support. However, some experts argue that the US foreign policy in Syria is ""sleepwalking to another Mideast disaster,"" suggesting that the current approach may not be effective.

There is evidence of Islamic extremist groups operating in Mexico, planning to attack the US border with car bombs or other vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The US government has issued a warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack on the border.

Neoconservatives are pushing for the US military to recommit itself to supporting their goals in the Middle East. However, some experts question why the mainstream US news media gives so much attention and credence to these groups, who laid the foundations for previous disasters.

Overall, the articles suggest that the US government's actions and policies regarding terrorism are complex and multifaceted, with various stakeholders having different opinions on how to address the issue.

9780445.0,reliable,reliable,0.9,95.19645833969116,True,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY because it accurately reports on the issue of Republican-led efforts to weaken environmental regulations in the US, specifically mentioning the inclusion of anti-environmental provisions in a funding bill and opposition from public interest groups like Planned Parenthood. There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and the article's claims about the impact of these efforts on public health and pollution are supported by the summary. The only discrepancy is that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY does not mention the League of Conservation Voters or Gene Karpinski specifically, but this is a minor detail that does not affect the overall accuracy of the classification.","A series of articles discusses the impact of Republican-led efforts to weaken environmental regulations in the US. House Republicans have added anti-environmental provisions to a funding bill, which could roll back decades-old successful regulations. The American Lung Association is urging Congress not to support these policies, citing concerns about public health and pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been criticized for allocating taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups promoting environmental justice in poor and minority communities. The EPA has also faced opposition from Republicans who want to limit its power and restrict funding for regulations.

A Senate report reveals that a group of wealthy liberal donors, including Tom Steyer and Hank Paulson, are directing the far-left environmental movement and lobbying for policy decisions. This group is seen as controlling major policy decisions and influencing the EPA.

House Republicans have unveiled another attempt to block Obama's climate and clean water rules by introducing provisions in their budget bill that would prohibit ""harmful, costly, and potentially job-killing regulations"" from the EPA. The bill includes measures to reduce funding for the EPA and block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule.

These efforts have sparked concerns about the impact on public health, environmental protection, and democracy.","Key points from recent articles:

Environmental issues were largely overlooked in the 2004 presidential campaign, with voters instead focusing on local concerns. The administration has rolled back or removed environmental protections without replacing them.

The US campaign finance industry is booming, with estimates suggesting $7.5-8 billion spent on the 2016 elections. This moneyed universe is expected to continue expanding, despite calls for reform.

Citizen petitions have been shown to be effective in identifying species that are biologically threatened. The public path to species protection is at least as effective as the agency path.

House Republicans are set to vote on a proposal to water down the earmark ban, allowing lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a ""federal purpose"".

Lawmakers from both parties have promised to work on food safety fixes, with disagreements over whether to split the FDA into two agencies and finance increased inspections through fees or general appropriations.

The Democratic Party is focusing on issues such as affordable child care, free community college, and expanded preschool. These proposals are being pursued by Democrats and some Republicans.

A chemical safety bill could help protect companies like Monsanto against legal claims, but there are major differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation.

Attorneys general and top environmental regulators from 15 states have written to Congress demanding changes to the bill to strengthen state powers in creating and enforcing needed protections.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 5 - another half a mil for “environmental justice”
another half a mil for “environmental justice” headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! though it has raked in upwards of $10 million in just a few months, a program that works to bring “environmental justice” to poor and minority communities keeps receiving a steady flow of taxpayer dollars even as the federal debt sits historically high levels. it’s all part of the obama administration’s effort to help low-income populations obtain the same degree of protection from health and environmental hazards as wealthy communities. in less than a year the environmental protection agency (epa) has doled out millions of dollars to leftwing groups— including some dedicated to helping illegal immigrants—that teach black, latino and indigenous folks how to recycle, reduce carbon emissions through “weatherization” and participate in “green jobs” training. a few days ago the agency gave new orleans-area groups $487,500 in “environmental justice, job training and education grants” to recruit and train candidates for “environmental jobs.” candidates will learn how to “provide air quality sampling,” according to the epa’s announcement. this shows the agency is committed to creating “green jobs and reaching out to low-income and minority communities that often bear the brunt of environmental degradation,” says the area’s regional administrator. the allocation comes just weeks after the epa dropped $6.2 million to train low-income residents for “green jobs” in atlanta. that chunk of taxpayer money went to “community

midterm election results and the fate of u.s. environmental policy % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! what do the republican gains in congress mean for the nations energy and environment policy? the fate of us environmental policy is tied to the fate of president obama. if the next two years are anything like the past two years, republicans will resist the president’s agenda on energy and the environment. in the absence of a working legislature, many will look to regulation as a viable avenue to advance the environmental agenda. however, the tea party candidates fiercely oppose government regulation and some republicans have made it clear that they will do everything they can to limit the power of government agencies like the epa. republican control of the house of representatives means that through annual agency funding bills, they can restrict the funding required to administer regulations. this includes the epa’s efforts to regulate co2, ozone and other elements of the clean air act. republicans also want the epa to justify the costs associated with regulating greenhouse gas emissions. some republicans even want to reduce regulations governing the use of leaded aviation fuels, or airborne mercury pollution. although the new republican congress may want to expand nuclear power and offshore oil drilling, they also want to avoid passing any legislation that president obama can claim as an accomplishment in 2012. republicans may choose to spend the next two years deriding the president and

Article 1 - the real environmental mandate
michael leavitt, who runs the environmental protection agency, declared recently that the voters on election day had delivered a clear mandate for president bush's environmental policies, a ""validation of our philosophy and agenda."" we're still trying to puzzle out which voters he had in mind. for one thing, environmental issues -- as well as related energy issues -- rarely broke the surface of the campaign. that was a shame, since these are important matters and the candidates' views differed just as sharply as they did on other issues. but the electorate can hardly be said to have delivered a mandate on something they weren't even asked to think about. to the extent that voters registered an opinion on environmental issues, they did it in local settings, and they consistently asked for more environmental protection than mr. bush has been offering them. with rare exceptions, the administration's operating mode has been to remove or roll back legal safeguards without putting much in their place, including the free-market solutions advertised as a substitute for regulations. this was true whether the issue was clean air, clean water or protecting the public lands from logging, destructive mining practices, overgrazing, and oil and gas drilling. the voters sent a different message. in colorado, a healthy majority approved a ballot initiative requiring electric utilities to generate 10 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2015, a more aggressive approach than any so far offered on the federal level. in montana, despite heavy industry lobbying, an even greater majority upheld a

Article 2 - the growing shadow of political money
photo like bettors checking las vegas odds on the super bowl, specialists in the nation’s booming campaign finance industry are tracking the action in the 2016 elections, not so much to assess the candidates as to see how much of a payout is likely this time around in the grand casino of american politics. the record total of $6.3 billion spent on the presidential and congressional elections of 2012 is only the starting point. estimates of next year’s likely total are running between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. this moneyed universe is certain to keep expanding as the political industry’s managers and their candidates master the unlimited fund-raising and spending devices they now have at hand. the sheer numbers should be enough to raise public alarm. but needed reforms are going nowhere, with too many congressional members busy bolstering their incumbency with the help of the same large-scale donors. in last year’s elections, the 100 biggest campaign check writers gave $323 million, plus many millions more in anonymous donations to politically active “social welfare” groups and other new money troughs. according to a report by politico, total spending by the 100 ultra-donors exceeded that of the 4.75 million ordinary americans who made smaller donations of $200 or less. the risk of special-interest corruption? five years ago, when the supreme court’s citizens united decision dashed decades of sensible controls by equating unlimited corporate and union spending with individual free speech, justice anthony kenn

Article 3 - public role in species protection
one of the virtues of the endangered species act is its openness to citizen participation. the fish and wildlife service can designate likely species for federal protection. but ordinary citizens and nongovernmental organizations can petition to have candidates of their own choosing considered for protection. not everyone thinks this is a virtue. the enemies of the endangered species act are legion, especially in the house of representatives, and one of their major complaints has always been citizen petitions, which they claim are politically motivated and expensive, especially when they include litigation. an article in the current issue of science, confirms the value of citizens’ petitions. the article asks, who does a better job choosing species that are biologically threatened, the fish and wildlife service or public petitioners? the answer is surprising. species nominated by petition or litigation “face higher levels of biological threat than species identified by f.w.s.” they also tend to be species that are threatened by development. as the authors note, “species in conflict with development face greater biological threat levels” than other species. in short, the public path to species protection is at least as effective, and maybe more so, than the agency path. among the hundreds of species originally identified by the public as likely candidates for protection are the northern spotted owl, the coastal california gnatcatcher and the united states population of the canada lynx. their listing as endangered or threatened led to important habitat protections that would not otherwise have occurred. these impressive statistical results also help restate — and re-r

Article 4 - house republicans to vote on bringing back earmarks
joshua roberts/reuters house speaker paul ryan has been quiet about the issue but his conference is expected to vote wednesday on a proposal to water down the earmark ban. washington ― house republicans are expected to vote on whether to water down a key piece of former house speaker john boehner’s (r-ohio) legacy ― the 2011 ban on earmarks . the house republican conference on wednesday will consider a narrowly tailored amendment that would allow lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a “federal purpose.” the measure ― filed by reps. john culberson (texas), mike rogers (ala.) and tom rooney (fla.) ― would not allow members of congress to direct federal funding for recreational facilities, museums or parks. it would also require lawmakers proposing earmarks to be identified and their requests to originate in committee. “this makes sure the entire process is out in the sunshine,” culberson told huffpost in a tuesday interview. “it’s gotta go through the entire committee process. you’ve got to put your name on it and be proud of it. don’t hide your light under a bushel basket.” earmarks are congressional spending items for specific local projects, including, infamously, a “bridge to nowhere” in alaska that became a symbol of wasteful spending designed only to benefit its sponsor. republicans banned earmarks in 2011 after taking control

Article 5 - bipartisan call for food safety fixes
washington — a parade of democratic and republican lawmakers promised at a house hearing on wednesday that they would work to pass a broad array of changes in the nation’s food safety system, although they disagreed on crucial details. among the sharpest areas of disagreement are whether to split the food and drug administration into two agencies and whether to finance increased safety inspections through fees on industry or through general appropriations. representative henry a. waxman, democrat of california and chairman of the house energy and commerce committee, said he would oppose splitting the f.d.a., at least for now. “our first goal should be to address the problems that plague this program where it currently sits,” mr. waxman said. “after we finish that job, we can consider whether a reorganization is necessary.” advertisement continue reading the main story but representative diana degette, democrat of colorado and vice chairwoman of the commerce committee, said she continued to advocate a separate agency to oversee food safety.

Article 6 - the parent agenda, the emerging democratic focus
the most obvious places to see the new focus have been in mr. obama's state of the union address and his budget. the central characters in his speech to congress were rebekah and ben erler, the struggling parents of two young children in minneapolis. “affordable, high-quality child care,” mr. obama said, is “not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.” he added, “it’s time we stop treating child care as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.” his budget — more of a wish list than a policy document, given republican control of congress — includes $200 billion over the next decade for child care and early education, along with $60 billion for free community college. he has already proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit. beyond washington, dozens of states have pursued expanded preschool in the last few years. although republicans have pushed some of the expansions, democrats — like bill de blasio, the new york mayor, who made the plan a centerpiece of his campaign — have been behind most of them. and mrs. clinton has signaled that many and perhaps all of these proposals will be part of her likely campaign for the democratic party’s presidential nomination in 2016. a recent commission on “inclusive prosperity,” containing several clinton allies, emphasized many of these proposals. “the united states, unfortunately

democrats and republicans — along with the chemical industry and even some environmentalists — agree that the pending legislation would be a major improvement over existing law. but from legal liability shields to state-based regulatory authority, the house and senate versions have major differences to resolve. the remaining disputes revolve around the basics of pre-emption: who gets to sue? and who gets to regulate the chemical industry? photo a monsanto spokeswoman said the company had received no special treatment from the house or the senate. “monsanto does not consider either version of the bill, with respect to the effect on preemption, to be a ‘gift,’ ” the spokeswoman, charla lord, said. advertisement continue reading the main story already, attorneys general and top environmental regulators from 15 states have written to leaders in congress demanding changes. “our future work depends on striking the right balance to strengthen the u.s. environmental protection agency’s abilities and funding, without limiting state powers in creating and enforcing needed protections,” said a letter, obtained by the new york times, sent by the top environmental regulators in california, connecticut, minnesota, new hampshire, new york, oregon, washington and west virginia. some of the most vociferous objections relate to the so-called monsanto clause. the provision does not mention the company by name, but between the early 1930s and 1977, monsanto manufactured almost all of the 1.25 billion pounds of pc

Article 8 - special interest money? let's add up the numbers
to the editor: re ''kerry's special friends,'' by david brooks (column, feb. 7): do mr. brooks and other conservatives really want to open a discussion on special interest money in politics? many americans are awakening from their three-year slumber to discover the myriad and cynical ways that the bush administration has raided the american treasury to benefit its corporate contributors -- tax cuts, no-bid iraq contracts to halliburton, toxic-waste cleanup expenses borne by taxpayers, the ''healthy forests'' and ''clear skies'' initiatives, and the pending energy bill come to mind. special interest money in politics is endemic and polluting, and john kerry deserves scrutiny, even condemnation, for his behavior. nonetheless, republicans might remember that people in glass houses . . . robert e. bionaz evergreen park, ill., feb. 7, 2004

Title: congress’s spending bills
Content: to the editor: “appropriations trickery in congress” (editorial, may 2) highlights the importance of keeping ideological policy riders out of congressional spending bills. in addition to the attacks mentioned in the editorial, the budget has been a primary venue for republican leaders to undermine environmental protections. last year’s appropriations process included no fewer than 113 anti-environmental riders, attacking everything from clean air rules to endangered species protections to land preservation. this year, we have already seen a provision blocking the clean water rule, which protects drinking water for one in three americans. more riders are sure to come. whether they attack the environment or other public protections, ideological policy riders simply have no place in budget bills, which should be about dollars and cents. that is why we have joined with a diverse set of public interest groups like planned parenthood and americans for financial reform demanding that congress pass a clean budget free of ideological policy riders. that is the surest path for polluter allies in congress to end the gridlock and avoid a government shutdown over funding the government. gene karpinski president league of conservation voters washington

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of articles discusses the impact of Republican-led efforts to weaken environmental regulations in the US. House Republicans have added anti-environmental provisions to a funding bill, which could roll back decades-old successful regulations. The American Lung Association is urging Congress not to support these policies, citing concerns about public health and pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been criticized for allocating taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups promoting environmental justice in poor and minority communities. The EPA has also faced opposition from Republicans who want to limit its power and restrict funding for regulations.

A Senate report reveals that a group of wealthy liberal donors, including Tom Steyer and Hank Paulson, are directing the far-left environmental movement and lobbying for policy decisions. This group is seen as controlling major policy decisions and influencing the EPA.

House Republicans have unveiled another attempt to block Obama's climate and clean water rules by introducing provisions in their budget bill that would prohibit ""harmful, costly, and potentially job-killing regulations"" from the EPA. The bill includes measures to reduce funding for the EPA and block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States rule.

These efforts have sparked concerns about the impact on public health, environmental protection, and democracy.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Key points from recent articles:

Environmental issues were largely overlooked in the 2004 presidential campaign, with voters instead focusing on local concerns. The administration has rolled back or removed environmental protections without replacing them.

The US campaign finance industry is booming, with estimates suggesting $7.5-8 billion spent on the 2016 elections. This moneyed universe is expected to continue expanding, despite calls for reform.

Citizen petitions have been shown to be effective in identifying species that are biologically threatened. The public path to species protection is at least as effective as the agency path.

House Republicans are set to vote on a proposal to water down the earmark ban, allowing lawmakers to direct funding to some federal agencies or state and local governments for a ""federal purpose"".

Lawmakers from both parties have promised to work on food safety fixes, with disagreements over whether to split the FDA into two agencies and finance increased inspections through fees or general appropriations.

The Democratic Party is focusing on issues such as affordable child care, free community college, and expanded preschool. These proposals are being pursued by Democrats and some Republicans.

A chemical safety bill could help protect companies like Monsanto against legal claims, but there are major differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation.

Attorneys general and top environmental regulators from 15 states have written to Congress demanding changes to the bill to strengthen state powers in creating and enforcing needed protections.

Article 1 - rand paul’s first senate win: “voters…wanted to give the finger to washington,” says the establishment gop candidate pau
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! trey grayson—the establishment-anointed candidate who rand paul trounced in kentucky’s 2010 gop senate primary—recently sat down with paul’s old campaign manager, david adams, to reminiscence about what the heck happened. the washington post has published the results. what’s the takeaway for libertarians? as adams says, “trey’s greatest strength was that he had mitch mcconnell in his corner. and rand’s greatest strength was that trey had mitch mcconnell in his corner. and it was a bigger strength for rand than it was for trey.” was this a sign that mcconnell just wasn’t serious enough as an across-the-board respecter of american liberties? not necessarily: donald trump won the state with over 62 percent of the vote on a scorched-earth nationalist platform that included promises to not cut entitlement spending, and then he appointed an attorney general, jeff sessions, who’s as opposed as anyone could be to paul on some of the senator’s pet issues, from surveillance to drug laws to criminal justice reform. (paul nonetheless voted to confirm sessions as attorney general. as adams says in the post piece, he’s trying to play along with others lately.) trump’s kentucky approval ratings have fallen by 20 percent lately. i’d like to think that’s because of appointments like sessions, but i doubt

Article 2 - paul ryan draws strength from pelosi, finally condemns antifa as “left-wing thugs”
paul ryan draws strength from pelosi, finally condemns antifa as “left-wing thugs” (before it's news) in the days since trump’s controversial press conference on the charlottesville tragedy in which he said there was “blame on both sides,” republicans have been tripping over one another to distance themselves from the white house. apparently the mere suggestion that antifa, a leftist group that has repeatedly incited violence at protests around the country, was anything more than an innocent bystander was grounds for impeachment, at least according to cnn, and just not something that republicans in congress were willing to touch. one such republican that has been noticeably silent on the antifa movement is none other than house speaker paul ryan…that is until nancy pelosi took a stand and gave him the courage to actually express his own opinion…well, through a spokeswoman anyway. finally, after days of being heavily criticized for a failure to condemn violent antifa attacks at berkeley, ryan’s staff issued the following statement to the daily caller last night: “speaker ryan believes, as is obvious, these individuals are left-wing thugs, and those who are committing violence need to be arrested and prosecuted. antifa is a scourge on our country.” of course, the statement sets a somewhat different tone when compared to paul ryan’s facebook post from last week, entitled “let there be no confusion,” which was clearly a shot at trump. i still firmly believe this

Article 4 - lessons from wednesday
lessons from wednesday (before it's news) i could spend all day posting links to articles about sen. rand paul’s filibuster, and the subsequent tantrums by mccain and lindsey. here are a couple that outline lessons to be learned. before i do, let me say that one of the major things that happened wednesday was that republicans, just a few republicans, showed how to command the media cycle for an entire day. and not just the new media. because of their conviction the main stream media was forced to cover it. and those who participated in the filibuster were thoughtful, focused, calm, and proactive, (not reactive). that lesson alone should be studied. here is jonathon moseley at american thinker: rand paul shifts political orbit rand paul unveiled a conservative answer to the left’s saul alinsky tactics: • rand paul shoved obama’s agenda off the public stage. just getting the political world talking about republicans’ message instead of obama’s means republicans are winning and obama is losing. • rand picked his issue very carefully. he chose the hill he wanted his opponent to die on. rand showed what happens when you wisely pick the right issue to defeat your opponent with. • yet rand’s issue seamlessly fit within his larger philosophy. he didn’t just take a cheap shot. rand chose an example that proves his larger point. as a caller to the chris plante show on washington’s wmal said, “

Article 5 - 3rd republican debate: a day of liberal media bias that will live in infamy
romney wordsworth – last night the republican presidential primary field of candidates held their third debate in boulder, colorado. the debate was “moderated” by cnbc with an all star team of democrat party hacks, character assassins, and outright liars. these were carl quintanilla, becky quick and john harwood, who were both continually booed by the audience and castigated by the candidates for asking the most unfair, inane, and insulting questions of all time. a paraphrased sampling of some of the most obnoxious questions: to all candidates: what is your biggest weakness? (in other words, tell us in your own words why you are unfit to be president) to donald trump: aren’t you just running a comic book version of a presidential campaign? to ben carson: i (john harwood) can’t make the math add up on your tax plan. to carly fiorina: the hewlit-packard board of directors fired you. i just wondered why you think we should hire you now? to marco rubio: you have a lack of bookkeeping skills. you accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. you faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought. and just last year, you liquidated a $$68,000 retirement fund. that’s something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. in terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you

Article 6 - rand paul, bobby jindal use donald trump to gain media coverage
rand paul, bobby jindal use donald trump to gain media coverage % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) visit benswann.com for more after announcing that he was running for president in the 2016 election, billionaire mogul donald trump has garnered attention both in the polls and in the media, leading other candidates who aren’t polling as high to start using trump to ensure media coverage of their own campaigns. according to a poll conducted by nbc and survey monkey, trump was polling at 23 percent among the 17 republican contenders following the first gop debate of the 2016 election on thursday. louisiana gov. bobby jindal received just one percent in the after-debate poll, and in an email to his supporters, he said that he was going to start a new campaign strategy: talking about trump to ensure media coverage. “i realize that the best way to make news is to mention donald trump. that’s the gold standard for making news,” jindal wrote. “so, i’ve decided to randomly put his name into my remarks at various points, thereby ensuring that the news media will cover what i have to say.” “but while the media is glued to everything donald trump says and hoping for republican on republican attacks, there is a soap opera happening on the democrat side that needs more attention,” wrote jindal, who went on to write that the democratic

Article 7 - rand paul is missing the point as obama spies on israel
rand paul is missing the point as obama spies on israel (before it's news) so we’ve got an obama administration scandal going on, as some inappropriate behavior has come out with respect to the “deal” with iran. i put deal in quotes because iran isn’t actually committed to anything. but regardless, the administration’s behavior around this deal is suspicious… but sen. rand paul (r-ky) 90% is ranting about some tangential matter. he misses the point when it comes to american and global security. what a disappointment he’s turned out to be. this is why rand paul would be a terrible president. it’s been confirmed that obama was spying on israel during the iran negotiations. the government was trying to listen in on conversations between prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his staff. why would obama do this, and what would he do with this information? i think a particularly important question is, was obama seeking to share information about israel with iran, in order to curry favor to get a deal done? considering obama already showed no regard for the security of the world, and of israel in particular, is it really that unreasonable to ask that? apparently rand paul though doesn’t even care about israel. he’s more worried about ‘stifling’ members of congress. like you could silence a blowhard senator or representative that easily. it’s baffling that in response to this revelation,

Article 8 - the democrat disconnect and the reign of the right
the democrat disconnect and the reign of the right (before it's news) i’ll admit it. i woke up on a wednesday morning in november 2016 in a world that i never thought was possible. trump winning the presidency is the single strangest political occurrence of my life. as a consultant, i figured it was time to hang up my business, because if i was this wrong about a guy like trump, i must not be any good at all at what i do. it wasn’t until i started looking at polling data, specifically data from the obama-to-trump flip states that i began to feel better about being that wrong (actually, i had accurately predicted the outcome of the election by two states the day before – flip nevada and wisconsin). how could those states that voted for obama in 2008 and 2012, flip by sometimes double digits to perhaps the most callused individual to ever run for president? the likeability factors between trump and obama were almost as divergent as the outcome of the 2012 and 2016 votes. certainly i was wrong, but it doesn’t get much more wrong than the dnc and the clinton campaign. in the days, weeks and months after the election, democrats, fueled by their denial and incredulity, sought to explain their loss on everything except the real problem that exists: their party is wildly disconnected from the american voter. it’s russia, stupid! imagine for

Article 1 - for republican leaders in congress, the headaches keep mounting
for republican leaders in congress, the headaches keep mounting image mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, and other republican leaders in congress are facing pressure from all sides of their party leading up to next year’s midterm elections. credit pete marovich for the new york times washington — republican leaders in congress are under attack from all sides of their own party, battered by voters from the right and left, spurned by frustrated donors and even threatened by the trump white house for ineffective leadership and insufficient loyalty. since last week, senate republicans lost one of their own when roy s. moore, the firebrand former state judge, trounced senator luther strange in a senate runoff in alabama. the retirement of senator bob corker of tennessee kicked off a potentially fratricidal fight for his seat, with the establishment’s preferred successor, gov. bill haslam, declining to run on thursday. an audiotape surfaced of vice president mike pence’s chief of staff, nick ayers, lambasting republican leaders and urging conservative donors to close their wallets to lawmakers who are disloyal to president trump. and a house republican, tim murphy of pennsylvania, was forced to resign this week after a text from his mistress became public in which she mocked him for trumpeting his staunch opposition to abortion as he pressured her to terminate a pregnancy. former representative michael grimm of new york has also resurfaced after serving time for felony tax fraud to challenge his republican

Article 2 - downturn in decibels, too
moments later mr. obama said, of rising oil prices and limited oil supplies, “there is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.” there were echoes — almost — of jimmy carter in that sentence. when was the last time a candidate vying for the highest office in the land summoned a memory of him rather than ronald reagan? to be sure, there were also the usual, classic, timeless paeans to american resourcefulness and optimism, along with the inevitable reagan reference — by mr. mccain. mr. obama noted that president john f. kennedy promised the moon — and the country indeed got there. mr. mccain said: “we can attack energy and health care at the same time. we’re not rifle shots here. we’re americans!” it was the oratorical equivalent of gov. sarah palin’s flag pin during the last debate, easily twice as big and twinkly as that of senator joseph r. biden jr. and there were a few moments during the long first hour — and a few more during the quick last half hour — when the exchanges were more spirited and tense. mr. mccain’s apparent irritation spiked as he exhibited condescension toward his younger rival. “by the way, my friends, i know you grow a little weary of this back and forth,” mr. mccain said, as he seized one of

Article 3 - at zappos, pushing shoes and a vision
next up was tony hsieh , 41, who has run zappos for 16 years and is the person who insisted that the company adopt holacracy. “i feel danielle is being overdramatic,” he deadpanned. “but i prefer her being overdramatic to passive-aggressive.” mr. hsieh (pronounced shay) is a minor celebrity in the technology industry. a son of taiwanese immigrants and a graduate of harvard, he sold his first company, linkexchange, to microsoft for $265 million. he then invested in zappos, became its chief executive and sold it to amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009. photo since then, mr. hsieh has managed to preserve zappos’s reputation as a fun place to work. the youthful work force is heavily tattooed; the dress code is aggressively casual. desks are cluttered with giant stuffed animals, and sound-emitting sculptures designed by the blue man group line the walls. “create fun and a little weirdness” is written in the zappos corporate charter. but as zappos grew, innovation slowed. the staff expanded, more managers joined the ranks, and the freewheeling culture lost momentum. “we had gone from being a fast speedboat to a cruise ship,” one longtime employee said. the boss felt it too. “a lot of people in the organization, including myself, felt like there

Article 4 - a nixon-era distraction steps out of limelight
bill kristol, editor of the weekly standard, said, ''lott is really virtually the last of the products of richard nixon's 'southern strategy' to be in major positions of power in the congress, and with his leaving, you will have cleared out people who, fairly or unfairly, have a somewhat compromised image to the country as a whole.'' but the past may not be so easy to leave behind, given race's enduring hold over politics, from the civil war and reconstruction to the civil rights revolution and affirmative-action debates of today. for all mr. bush's desire to broaden the republican appeal to black and hispanic voters and for all his personal rejections of prejudice, he and his father before him have used the symbolism of the past to political advantage. indeed, no sooner had mr. lott stepped down, sped by mr. bush's stern condemnation, than the president's spokesman, ari fleischer, found himself faced with renewed questions from reporters about whether mr. bush regretted his visit in 2000 to bob jones university, which then banned interracial dating. by midday, democrats were circulating questions about the civil rights records of mr. lott's all-but-certain successor, senator bill frist of tennessee, and the new chairman of the party's senate campaign committee, george f. allen of virginia, including mr. allen's acknowledgment that he once had the confederate battle flag in his living room. mr

Article 5 - ex-governor says conviction was political
it was a small part of a voluminous justice department bribery-and-racketeering case, most of which — 25 out of 32 counts — was dismissed by the jury. nonetheless the government is urging a sentence of 30 years and is asking judge mark fuller of federal district court to even weigh charges on which mr. siegelman was acquitted. that incomplete government victory, in turn, loomed in the background of the arguments of mr. siegelman’s lawyers tuesday as they urged mr. fuller, an appointee of president bush, to go easy on their client, who was sitting in the dock with mr. scrushy. supporters, some wearing siegelman campaign buttons, packed the courtroom for the former governor, an alabama fixture whose career stretches back a quarter-century here, to the george wallace era. his start in politics came as george mcgovern’s alabama campaign manager in the 1972 presidential election. the shakiness of the federal case against mr. siegelman had forced prosecutors to “adopt the garbage-can theory of rico,” said g. robert blakey, a law professor at the university of notre dame and former prosecutor, referring to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act. professor blakey suggested that the charges against mr. siegelman had been indiscriminate from the outset. the government’s only limited success was very much on the mind of the former governor, once the brightest light in democratic politics

Article 6 - clean the gulf, clean house, clean their clock
in rolling stone’s account, the current interior secretary, ken salazar , left too many “long-serving lackeys of the oil industry in charge” at m.m.s. even as he added to their responsibilities by raising offshore drilling to record levels. one of those bush holdovers was tainted by a scandal that will cost taxpayers as much as $53 billion in uncollected drilling fees from the oil giants — or more than twice what obama has extracted from bp for its sins so far. dickinson reports that salazar and m.m.s. continued to give bp free rein well after obama took office — despite the company’s horrific record of having been “implicated in each of the worst oil disasters in american history, dating back to the exxon valdez in 1989.” even as the interior secretary hyped himself as “a new sheriff in town,” bp was given a green light to drill in the gulf without a comprehensive environmental review. obama has said he would have fired tony hayward , bp’s chief executive, but his own managers have not been held so accountable. the new director of m.m.s. installed by salazar 10 months ago has now walked the plank, but she doesn’t appear to have been a major player in lapses that were all but ordained by policy imperatives from above. the president has still neither explained nor apologized for his own assertion in early april that “oil rigs today generally don’t cause spills” — a statement

Article 7 - obama bypasses senate process, filling 15 posts
“at a time of economic emergency, two top appointees to the department of treasury have been held up for nearly six months,” mr. obama said. “i simply cannot allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the basic functioning of government.” with lawmakers back in their home states and mr. obama spending a quiet family weekend at camp david, the white house issued the statement announcing the president’s intent to appoint mr. becker, and 14 others, mostly to fill positions on his economic and homeland security teams. the white house said the 15 nominees had been waiting, on average, seven months to be confirmed. they are expected to begin work over the next week; the president’s action will enable them to serve without senate confirmation until the chamber adjourns at the end of 2011. republicans, who have cast mr. becker as a pro-labor radical, issued a flurry of angry statements. they wasted little time in reminding reporters that when george w. bush was president, then-senator obama had railed against the recess appointment of john r. bolton as ambassador to the united nations, saying that mr. bolton would be “damaged goods” and lacked credibility without senate confirmation. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, called the president’s move “yet another episode of choosing a partisan path despite bipartisan opposition.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot

Article 8 - conservatives fear foley scandal will cost votes
some republicans argued that mr. hastert’s resignation would be an extreme remedy. “give me a break on this resignation stuff,” representative patrick mchenry of north carolina said on cnn. “president bill clinton actually had sex with an intern in the white house — he didn’t resign.” other conservatives were hoping the matter would simply die out — at least in local newspapers. such scandals “have to be fed daily,” said patrick buchanan, the conservative commentator and former presidential candidate, adding that this one could fade within a week. but if new information emerges, mr. buchanan said on cnn, “it will continue, it will deepen and it will worsen.” the scandal has jolted republicans battling to retain control of the house and senate. political analysts from both parties say the scandal has placed at least five more republican congressional seats into serious contention, undercutting republican support among elderly voters, women and religious conservatives. it produced the extraordinary scene over the weekend of another republican leader involved in the matter, representative thomas reynolds of new york, airing a campaign ad that included an apology. “nobody’s angrier and more disappointed that i didn’t catch his lies,” mr. reynolds says in the television commercial. but mr. reynolds notes in the ad that he called complaints about mr. foley to mr. hastert’s attention months ago. “i trusted that others had investigated. looking back, more

Content: “he’s basically the defense, the prosecution, the judge, the jury and the hangman in this scenario,” said senator judd gregg of new hampshire, the senior republican on the budget committee, whose staff has been meeting with mr. frumin on reconciliation matters for months. “it all comes down to him.” that makes some republicans uncomfortable. mr. gregg calls mr. frumin “a very fair and straightforward guy in a very difficult job.” but in a sign of how acrimonious the debate has become, others in the minority party have been insinuating that mr. frumin is in the democrats’ pocket — remarks that amount to a kind of washington version of working the referee before the big game. the rumblings began in december when mr. frumin sided with democrats as republicans tried to delay a health care vote. senator jim demint, republican of south carolina, said in comments published in the capitol hill newspaper roll call that mr. frumin was “clearly biased” — a remark that was apparently too blunt for some of his colleagues, judging by the apology mr. demint later delivered on the senate floor. now, with the white house pushing congress to act on health care by easter, the warnings and caveats about mr. frumin are flying once again. “i think he’s an honest man, but we’ll see,” said senator orrin g. hatch, republican of utah. “some people buckle under pressure. he would lose tremendous prestige if he buckles under pressure.” photo asked if he had evidence of partisan leanings by mr. frumin, mr. hatch shrugged. “i’m sure he’s a democrat,” the senator said, “but i think he’s an honest man.” in fact, mr. frumin, 63, is a registered independent, voting records show. parliamentarians are appointed by the party in power; mr. frumin, who joined the office as an assistant in 1977, is the only parliamentarian to have been installed in the top job by both democrats and republicans. democrats put him there in 1987 when senator robert c. byrd was majority leader; in 2001, he was reinstalled under trent lott, a republican. advertisement continue reading the main story the parliamentarian’s job requires years of apprenticeship, and the work is so obscure that few people in washington can do it. for much of his career, mr. frumin has alternated with robert dove, who learned the hard way what can happen to a parliamentarian who irks a senate leader. he was fired by mr. lott after advising republicans that they could not add a $5 billion emergency allocation to the budget. that mr. dove called it “a slush fund” probably did not help. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the

is sex in cinema getting too real? (before it's news) the script, christophe paou says, was even more sexually explicit, so the french actor knew what he was getting himself into when he signed up for alain guiraudie’s film, stranger by the lake. paou plays michel, a handsome and charismatic man – with an extremely sinister side – who meets franck, a younger man, at a cruising spot. stranger by the lake is one of two sexually-explicit films released this weekend, the other being lars von trier’s much-hyped nymphomaniac, in which charlotte gainsbourg plays joe, a sex addict. both films use body doubles for the genital close-ups and the explicit scenes. read more : http://www.newssum.com/is-sex-in-cinema-getting-too-real-4181

Article 3 - movie review -- <em>spider-man: homecoming</em>
(before it's news) another bleedin’ spider-man movie, you say? homecoming is the second attempt in five years to reboot this wobbly franchise—and it might do the trick. for one thing, thanks to some desperate corporate deal-making, spidey is now officially a part of the marvel cinematic universe, which enables cross-promotional high-fives by fellow avengers iron man and captain america. most important, there’s been a fresh character re-think by indie director jon watts (cop car), who’s also one of the movie’s many writers. watts’s peter parker—the larval spider-man—is basically just a kid, a 15-year-old high school student with an impossible crush on a beautiful senior and an impossible dream of taking her to the big homecoming dance. the movie is essentially a teen coming-of-age story (think john hughes, clueless, can’t hardly wait) cranked up with a blast of spidery superpowers. watts was wise in casting tom holland to play this new spider-man. holland (the lost city of z) was 20 years old when the movie was shot, younger than tobey maguire and andrew garfield, his immediate predecessors in the role. as a former stage and tv dancer, he brings an irresistible athletic energy to the proceedings. the movie does all of us a favor by ditching the traditional spider-man origin story. we know about uncle ben. we know about the radioactive spider bite

Article 4 - “they live”, the weird movie with a powerful message
‘they live’ is a science-fiction movie from the eighties that features aliens, a wwf wrestler and a whole lot of sunglasses. what’s not to like? while, at first glance, the movie appears to be a bunch of nonsense, ‘they live’ actually communicates a powerful message about the elite and its use of mass media to control the masses. is the movie describing what we call the illuminati? this article looks at the deeper meaning of john carpenter’s strange but fascinating movie ‘they live’. warning: major spoilers ahead (get over it, the movie is 24 years old). watching they live is a conflicting experience. it is an odd combination of eye-opening messages with lackluster acting, powerful social commentary with 1950’s b-movie special effects and gripping satire with odd punchlines. constantly making viewers oscillate between “wow, that was genius!” to “wow, that was corny!”, it is difficult to properly evaluate the movie from a cinematographic point of view. however, from a “message” point of the view, they live is gold. based on ray nelson’s short story eight o’clock in the morning, the movie is one of those rare subversive stories that forces viewers to question their world and their surroundings. because, despite the fact that the movie is about ghoulish aliens, it communicates truths to the viewers that are only alluded to in mainstream movies. in fact, looking deeper into the storyline,

Article 1 - fantasies without bounds for a lothario with limits
crispin hellion glover’s planned trilogy of blatant weirdness continues with a second installment, “it is fine! everything is fine.” like last year’s part 1, “what is it?,” this follow-up (with david brothers as co-director) will attract only the most adventurous filmgoers, who will have to wade through some rather repugnant material to weigh the movie’s merits. steven c. stewart, who appeared briefly in “what is it?” ensconced in a supersize seashell while being sexually stimulated by a woman’s hand, is now, as screenwriter and star, the master of his own pornographic fantasy world, which stems from his frustrations with being disabled. (mr. stewart, who had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair, died before the film’s completion.) he portrays himself as a serial lady-killer whose long-tressed victims not only understand clearly what he says (a luxury audiences won’t share) but also readily sleep with him, unaware that he will strangle them afterward. photo alternately sweet and devilish, mr. stewart moves us to pity and revulsion, in essence recreating feelings similar to those that might be experienced by someone faced with a disabled person in reality. ever the tireless, traveling showman, mr. glover will again be on hand before each screening to present his hourlong “big slide show,” which, like his films, is wildly impassioned

Article 2 - the american fairy tale, fun house style
it was so intense that no one bought it, so for years he supported his family by doing pickup work in construction and photography that sometimes brought him into los angeles film studios. hollywood and the mechanics of film fantasy are a primary source of his art. this is particularly true of the recent works that tend to be big-budget projects, now that the market has finally discovered him. the armory installation, his biggest so far, is a compendium of signature ingredients: violence, humor, sex, impotence, appetite, degradation, art history, politics and pop culture. the piece is based on two intersecting elements: the 1937 disney animated film “snow white and the seven dwarfs” and the suburban home of mr. mccarthy’s childhood. but like the installation’s title — “ws” stands for white snow — everything is in a disordered version of an original form. on an islandlike platform in the center of the armory, mr. mccarthy has constructed a three-quarters-scale facsimile of the facade of his childhood ranch house in utah and set it, inaccessibly, in a kind of dank rain forest of plastic trees and fake flowers. the rest of the house is set up outside the forest and is approachable, with cutaway walls and windows. but while its rooms are precise in their period décor, they are strewn with refuse, splattered with dark fluids and unoccupied except for the nude bodies of a

american assassin a veteran c.i.a. officer (michael keaton) takes a vengeful rookie (dylan o’brien) under his wing; together, the kid and his mentor unravel an international plot. sanaa lathan, shiva negar and taylor kitsch also star in this adaptation of vince flynn’s best seller. michael cuesta directed. brad’s status ben stiller’s brad, who works for a nonprofit, is forced to confront his self-perceived mediocrity after a college visit to boston with his son (austin abrams) makes him jealous of his own former college pals’ success. michael sheen, luke wilson, jemaine clement and mike white play his high-rolling chums. mr. white, best known for his screenplay for “school of rock,” wrote and directed. easy living adam keleman’s debut feature is not a remake of the jean arthur comedy classic from 1937, written by preston sturges, but it does concern old movies, or at least a door-to-door saleswoman (caroline dhavernas) who finds them inspirational. embargo a documentary examines the history of the united states’ embargo against cuba, making the case that the policy has been bad for both countries. extraordinary ordinary people as part of a decades-spanning project, the filmmaker and arts advocate alan govenar profiles winners of the national heritage fellowship, an award

Article 4 - first came the sitcom. then came the murder. then came the pornographic web site. now here comes the holly wood biopic!
carpenter, played by willem dafoe in ''auto focus,'' met crane on the set of ''hogan's heroes.'' he worked for sony, instructing wealthy customers on how to operate home-video equipment -- a technology then in its infancy. carpenter (who is not john carpenter the horror-film director) set up systems for elvis presley and alfred hitchcock before selling equipment to crane. the two men subsequently became friends, united in their pursuit of women in bars, through singles' ads and at swing parties. ''a day without sex,'' crane liked to say, ''is a day wasted.'' many of these encounters were captured on video. crane's celebrity helped score the girls; carpenter typically played cinematographer. the friendship ran aground, however, when crane's second marriage collapsed and he could no longer find work. (hollywood had learned of his secret.) blaming his relationship with carpenter for his problems, crane severed contact. this break upset carpenter, who had become emotionally dependent -- and perhaps sexually fixated -- on his famous friend. that conjecture is central to ''auto focus''; schrader frames the symbiotic relationship of carpenter and crane as a story of unrequited love. indeed, when crane was found dead in scottsdale, ariz., carpenter was the main suspect. he was later acquitted, because of a lack of evidence, and died in 1998. ''auto focus'

Article 5 - an american family living in a new america
perhaps the most charged moments occur in arguments between mayra and her mother about undone homework, for in this household no safety net hangs between academic achievement and the street. ''i'm sacrificing too much so that you can get ahead,'' sandra ortiz says. ''not so you can fail everything your first year of high school.'' yet monica, the family paragon, herself emerges as a complicated, conflicted figure, whose talent and ambition have won her entrée into the ivy league at the cost of a certain estrangement from her own family and culture. her boyfriend in the film is an italian-born classmate. when her parents and sisters visit relatives in the dominican republic, she remains in new york. ''it makes me feel horrible,'' she says, ''but you have to create some kind of distance.'' the intimacy of mr. matthews's portrayal reflects more than just his aesthetic. he has known the ortiz family for 25 years. shortly after his own family returned from venezuela, where his father was doing research for a doctoral dissertation, sandra ortiz arrived in new york from a dominican hamlet called gina clara, which lacked both electricity and running water. possessed of a third-grade education and a fierce will to offer her family something better, mrs. ortiz went to work for the matthewses as a housekeeper. from his little boy's perspective, aaron grasped only the outlines of her life. then, one

Article 6 - in new haven, dramas that speak to our time
in a note in the long wharf audience guide, mr. lucas does his best to dissuade us from the idea that he has written a political play. he says that he did not embark on “prayer for my enemy” in order to make a point. the reason? “i have never once, in a long life of theatergoing, heard one single audience member say, you know, i think i’m going to vote for the other party because of what this play has showed me.” and shakespeare, it is certain, did not have george w. bush in mind when he wrote “richard ii.” it’s difficult to gauge how “richard ii” might have come across during the presidencies of ronald reagan, for example, or bill clinton. an extraordinary, underappreciated outpouring of verse that tells the story of the hard-luck 14th-century english monarch deposed by henry iv, it probably would have had little resonance beyond the literary. but right now the play, even in evan yionoulis’s far-from-ideal production, has an unmistakable immediacy and bite. brenda davis’s superb set, its scaffolding studded with brasslike effigies of dead kings entombed in plexiglas sarcophagi, does more than depict the evanescence of power. it is a visual representation of history repeating itself. and in any case, there

Article 7 - review: ‘morris from america’: a 13-year-old stranger in a strange land
“morris from america,” chad hartigan’s charming new film, begins with a father-son discussion of hip-hop, an argument about beats, flows and hooks. it’s partly an affectionate intergenerational dispute; 13-year-old morris (markees christmas) is skeptical of his father’s old-school dogma, while his dad, curtis (craig robinson), dismisses his son’s taste as too pop. the conversation also provides a clue about the movie’s own strategies. it’s a pop confection with a rough, honest texture, real but not raw and suffused with an infectious sweetness that lingers after the final shot. as curtis puts it, he and morris are “the only brothers in heidelberg,” an african-american family in the perplexing and sometimes unfriendly environment of a picturesque german town. curtis, a former soccer player in the united states, is on the coaching staff of the local team, and the rest of his back story is conveniently blurry. like almost every other single dad you see in a movie, he is a widower, a shortcut to audience sympathy that mr. hartigan might have had the wit to avoid. video but the novelty of the setting and the familiarity of the premise — an adolescent boy navigating a bumpy stretch on the road from boyhood to maturity — combine to give “morris from america” buoyancy and heart. mr. christmas is an unusually subtle actor for someone his age

Article 8 - taking stock of the gay-rights revolution
tom (the lawyer): i hate classifying everything that way. ''gay play.'' what's a ''straight play''? michael (the teacher): mamet. charles: you see? that's exactly the kind of joke that would be in the play about us. this exchange, which couldn't be more accurate in its synopsis, is typical of mr. tolins's shrewd humor. throughout this smart, timely and funny play, the self-awareness of the characters is eclipsed only by that of the playwright, whose intention here is clearly to express impatience with the staler elements of gay dramatic literature and to push the ''gay'' play forward into its next generation of concerns. the subject of ''the last sunday in june'' -- so named for the date of the annual gay pride parade, which is going on outside the window -- is the function of the ''gay community,'' however that might be defined, at a time when the idea of gay rights is no longer revolutionary. tom (peter smith) and michael (johnathan f. mcclain) are on the verge of moving to the suburbs, i.e., out of their gay-centric neighborhood and into the land of straight people. and the questions that underlie the gathering are about things like whether gay men are better off among themselves or living in the wider world, whether defining oneself by one's sexual orientation is healthy and fulfilling and whether the gains for homosexuals in the last three decades have turned gay

Title: drug-fueled rants from a ’50s film
Content: photo let’s get this right out of the way: the full title of daniel fish’s new work is “tom ryan thinks he’s james mason starring in a movie by nicholas ray in which a man’s illness provides an escape from the pain, pressure and loneliness of trying to be the ultimate american father, only to drive him further into the more thrilling though possibly lonelier roles of addict and misunderstood visionary.” sounds kind of like fun, doesn’t it? and you’d think a 53-word title might say it all, right? well, it isn’t always, and it doesn’t, quite. the play, a clever two-person distillation of nicholas ray’s 1956 movie “bigger than life,” pays deserving tribute to a cinematic act of provocation. ray’s film, while a commercial failure, was a bold grenade lobbed at the pieties of the 1950s. the play only faintly enriches the story, despite the actors’ vigorous efforts and the script’s flashes of absurdist wit. in the film james mason plays ed avery, an underpaid suburban schoolteacher who assumes a second job unbeknownst to his wife, lou (barbara rush), only to learn he has blood ailment requiring cortisone pills — steroids. soon he’s secretly addicted to them, and they play havoc on his sanity, at great cost to his work, lou and his young son, richie. ed’s drug-induced hyperactive rants allow ray to express heresies of the period (slamming the education system, religion, the banalities of suburban life) while parodying its values. (ed sadistically drives richie to “be a man” and perfect his football skills.) meanwhile the drugs provide the director a convenient out: a chemical cause for ed’s feverish dissent. in mr. fish’s 65-minute rendition — part of incubator arts’ other forces festival — the words flow briskly as all the roles alternate between thomas jay ryan (he of the start of the title) and christina rouner, occupying a bare stage. mr. ryan plays ed more often than ms. rouner, who often plays lou and richie. there is humor (mr. ryan praises thunderbird wine as if he were in a tv commercial on auto-repeat; an inflatable miller lite blimp stands in for the football), and there are limp attempts at redressing the lot of richie and lou, the butts of nasty verbal abuse in the film and even louder — very loud, at close proximity — abuse onstage. ms. rouner bravely tries, as ms. rush did, to convey dignity. but she is vastly eclipsed by mr. ryan and by mr. fish’s direction. mr. ryan, who persuasively portrayed the gay activist harry hay in “the temperamentals” last year, offers fleeting notes of

Article 4 - many types of yoga bearing many types of secrets
many types of yoga bearing many types of secrets (before it's news) from exhalezine: yoga is a wonderful form of meditative exercise having seen a surge of popularity in western cultures within the last decade. yoga offer many health benefits such as lessened anxiety, greater flexibility and strength, and increased self-awareness—among many others. different types of yoga are best suited for different types of personal goals [3]. knowing how to discern between each can help you build a practice that best suits your own needs. hot yoga, often mistaken for bikram yoga, is a practice that offers invigorating and detoxifying results. aerial yoga on the other hand is a slower paced practice that builds a deeper cadence with gravity and letting go. different types of yoga all have different benefits and can each offer you a unique experience. quick history yoga has been around for centuries, having mostly originated in india. many of the terminology used in modern western yoga practices finds root in sanskrit origins. this language is though to have developed around 2000 bce and having carried such beautiful ideas as poetry, philosophy, and even scientific concepts. india is also renowned for having been the birthplace of ayruvedic medicine, also having become popularized in western culture as alternative medicine. while much of our written records of yoga trace it to this period, it’s generally believed to have developed as far back as 5000-8000 bce. this long history has seen many divergent branches

Article 5 - reiki healing – an introduction
reiki healing – an introduction (before it's news) reiki healing is possible because everything is energy, and all things are connected through a subtle, underlying energy matrix. consciousness is part of this matrix too, and that includes our thoughts, beliefs and emotions. it’s the energetic vibrational patterns we construct in our consciousness that lead to illness, disease and other unwanted situations in our lives. energy healing in general is about treating a person holistically. energy medicine goes beyond the symptoms of disease but instead looks at the causes – and these can be found at the spiritual, emotional, mental or physical levels. because the root causes of conditions can be complex and multilayered this healing shouldn’t be seen as an ‘instant fix’ – although sometimes, that’s exactly what can happen. reiki healing is reconnecting to spirit as the greek philospher plato said, ‘the cure of the part should not be attempted without treatment of the whole. no attempt should be made to cure the body without the soul… this is the error of our day, that physicians first separate the soul from the body.’ so in order to truly heal, we need to reconnect with our spiritual origins – although this doesn’t mean we have to be religious. the difference between spirituality and religion is that followers of religion look to a divine power outside of themselves for help and healing, whereas people with a spiritual outlook believe that the power is within. reiki healing energy there’s nothing special about reiki

Article 1 - india and the politics of yoga
yoga has encountered such objections before — conservative christian parents in new york and california have branded its use in schools as religious indoctrination. since 2004, islamic clerics have issued fatwas prohibiting yoga for muslims in egypt, malaysia and indonesia. the question of whether there is any justification to such opposition is a delicate one. certainly, yoga’s evolution has been inextricably linked with that of hinduism. the word itself, linguistically related to “yoke,” first appears in the rig veda, a sacred hindu text from around the 15th century b.c., to describe a chariot yoked to horses, in which a felled war hero might ascend to the sun. as the tradition of meditation and exercise developed among indian ascetics between a.d. 200 and 400, “yoga” acquired its new meaning of reining in body and mind to rise above worldly concerns. in this sense, yoga undeniably embodies the worldview of hinduism (as well as buddhism and jainism), in which the goal is to end suffering through enlightenment. advertisement continue reading the main story however, there is no historical record of other religions’ disapproving of yoga. muslim travelers in india, fascinated by yoga’s teachings, started bringing translated works to the islamic world almost a millennium ago. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address.

know the benefits of wearing rudraksha last updated: sunday, november 13, 2016 - 20:16 0 follow @zeenews new delhi: we all know that the precious stone rudraksha symbolises lord shiva. according to shiv puran, it is believed that the precious beads were formed out of the tear drops of lord shiva when he came out of meditation. hence, when the tear drops fell on the ground, it took the form of seeds, which gave birth to rudraksha trees. rudraksha seed is produced by the large evergreen broad-leaved trees in the genus elaeocarpus, that are found in the gangetic plain in the foothills of the himalayas to southeast asia, nepal and indonesia. here, we highlight some benefits of wearing rudraksha: it is believed that rudraksha has an electromagnectic character that helps heal the human body medically. also, the precious stone has a property of diamagnetism that helps heal heart-related problems like hypertension. it is helpful for those who are constantly travelling as the magical stone helps create a cocoon of your own energy and thus, prevents one from falling sick. rudraksha also guards against any negative energy around you. lastly, rudraksha not just heals you medically and protects you from the evil eye but also heals you spiritually. first published: sunday, november 13,

Article 3 - china and india file rival claims over tibetan medicine
recognition could be beneficial, they said, if it led to greater access to medical care for rural tibetans, recruitment of more tibetan medical practitioners for high-level advisory roles or laws to regulate the production of pharmaceuticals. the worry, however, is that unesco recognition could lift the industry’s commercial development without addressing some of its underlying problems, such as the watering-down of traditional medicinal formulas and the over-harvesting of medicinal ingredients in the wild. the founding text of tibetan medicine is “for the whole world to enjoy,” said tashi tsering phuri, the director of the tibetan medical and astro-science institute in dharamsala, the indian city that serves as the seat of the tibetan government in exile and the residence of the dalai lama. “it should not be a bone of contention between two big nations.” sowa rigpa is practiced in china, india and neighboring countries including bhutan, mongolia and nepal. the name is often translated into english as “the science of healing,” and the present form of the discipline’s founding text, “the four tantras,” is attributed by many western scholars to a 12th-century tibetan physician, with antecedents stretching to the eighth century or earlier. photo as late as the early 1990s, there was no discernible competition between china and india to claim tibetan medicine as cultural pat

Article 6 - in india, eternal rhythms embody a national spirit
nrityagram was founded in 1990 as a gurukul, or residential village of learning, by the actress protima bedi. though she died in 1998, her name is constantly invoked here. her vivid personality and love affairs were one part of her legend, but another was her commitment to indian classical dance, and in particular odissi, of which she became by all accounts a compelling exponent. in essence nrityagram remains as she had hoped: an idyllic place where it is not unusual for people to dance — usually with live musicians — morning, noon, and night. india has no fewer than eight genres of dance that have been officially deemed classical (as well as innumerable folk forms). the country’s complex political and social history, however, brought most of these forms close to extinction by the 1950s. most of these idioms were connected to female temple dancers known as devadasis, a legendary caste surrounded in moral controversies (some were concubines, some were vowed to chastity, some dwindled into prostitution) and now virtually defunct. though the classical dance forms today have become well established again, they’ve been extensively reconstructed — and inevitably altered — during the last century. odissi, which came the closest to oblivion, derives from the state of orissa on india’s east coast; karnataka, including nrityagram, is southwest and largely inland. as a result a few orissan pur

The concept of avatars, such as Manu, who are believed to have played a significant role in shaping human culture, exists in various traditions. The idea of a universal energy code is also present, with some researchers exploring its connection to chakras and spiritual practices.

Crystals can interact with the body's natural subtle energies, holding vibrations that correspond to specific colors and energies. This concept is used in crystal healing, which aims to balance and align the body's energy centers.

The idea of a new chakra, known as the Soulight Chakra, has been proposed by some researchers, linking it to the inner earth sun and the unification of dimensions. The concept of light codes and templates is also present, with some researchers exploring their connection to spiritual practices and personal growth.

Overall, these concepts are rooted in Eastern metaphysical theories

the two-state solution: achieving majority support among israelis and palestinians (before it's news) credit: xandernieuws.punt.nl in july, i wrote a blog post that commented on a couple of polls that had recently been conducted which seemed to contradict themselves. one poll, commissioned by the israel peace initiative and conducted by the israeli company new wave research, had found that a majority of israelis support the amended arab peace initiative (api), which proposes that all arab states grant israel full recognition and normalization of relations after the establishment of an independent palestinian state on the basis of the 1967 lines with swaps and a just and agreed upon solution to the palestinian refugee problem is reached. the original api had called for a complete israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines, which had never acquired majority support in israel. the other poll, conducted jointly by the hebrew university and the palestinian center for policy and survey research (psr) had found that a majority of palestinians also support the amended api. at first glance, the amended api seemed to be the common ground on which a majority of israelis and palestinians could stand. yet there was one problem: the poll conducted jointly by the hebrew university and psr (the “joint poll”) also found that only 24 percent of israelis support the amended api, almost a 10% decrease from the level of support before the

Article 1 - israeli and palestinian envoys meet with bush aides
another focus of the discussions today, an informed diplomat said, was to get some mutual pullback in gaza, though not in the west bank. under a formula being discussed, israel would pull back its forces in parts of gaza, and they would be replaced by forces under the control of muhammad dahlan, the new palestinian security director. mr. sharon's own meeting with mr. bush, originally scheduled for tuesday, was canceled because of the new cycle of violence in the middle east. dov weisglass, mr. sharon's chief of staff, and salam fayyad, the palestinian finance minister, came to meet with american representatives as concern grew that without quick action, the middle east peace effort could unravel. condoleezza rice, the national security adviser, and william j. burns, assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, met with the middle eastern envoys. before the meetings, ms. rice had lunch with secretary of state colin l. powell to discuss the agenda for the meetings, administration officials said. on tuesday, mr. bush spoke to both mr. sharon and mahmoud abbas, the new palestinian prime minister, to ask for concessions to get negotiations going. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to

Article 2 - from darkness of munich olympics, moments of clarity
growing up in williamsport, pa., zaq harrison watched on television as his boyhood idol, the swimmer mark spitz, won a seventh gold medal, then a record for one olympics. the israelis were abducted the next day, propelling harrison on a continuing reassessment of heroism. a finance professional from baltimore, he recently began summer camp discussions about the munich olympians and the ethical issues athletes face. harrison, 48, informs children that the israeli wrestling coach moshe weinberg and the weight lifter yosef romano gamely fought the 1972 terrorists. he displays single white placards, each bearing a munich name, inviting the teenage campers to recite them. he always reserves berger, a world-class jewish athlete, for last. harrison said he admired berger because he “figuratively lifted all of us on his shoulders” into a german arena a generation after the holocaust. “i’ve gotten 2,000 kids to say the names out loud,” harrison said. “it’s a different learning experience.” jed margolis attended berger’s rival school, cleveland heights high school. “david’s was a name we all knew and looked up to,” said margolis, 61, the executive director of the united states branch of the international maccabi movement, which promotes jewish pride through sports. “he was the ultimate student

Article 3 - palestinian opposes provisional state
none of the parties to the talks here predicted any speedy breakthrough. although no formal proposal has been presented, some israeli officials have floated the idea that the peace process could be accelerated by establishing a provisional palestinian state within temporary borders to be subsequently set. but mr. abbas said the idea would never work, fearing that the palestinians might be locked into an inferior map. “we have also noted to minister rice our decision to end any temporary or transitional solutions including a state with temporary borders because we do not believe it to be a realistic choice that can be built upon,” mr. abbas said during a joint news conference with the secretary of state. mr. abbas also issued assurances that there would be careful spending and accounting of american money should congress approve a state department proposal for $86 million in “non-lethal assistance” to enhance those branches of the palestinian security forces directly under his political wing — as opposed to those loyal to hamas. “be confident that we will not misuse any aid that we receive from any party,” he said, noting that vehicles and communications equipment, as well as weapons, had been destroyed in clashes with the israelis. late sunday night, israeli troops shot two palestinians, detonating the explosives they were carrying as they approached the gaza strip’s border fence with israel, the israeli military said. both palestinians were killed, the military added. the rice-abbas meeting was held in

Article 4 - his dream, to be the light at the end of the israeli-palestinian tunnel
he did have three connections to the middle east, however: his wife, zeina, is a lebanese-born christian; his master's thesis dealt with the creation of the arab league; and he studied hebrew at a private catholic high school in geneva. it was mr. keller's idea to bring israeli and palestinian freelancers together on swiss soil after the peace initiative begun by president bill clinton fell apart in early 2001. ''i have a crazy idea,'' mr. keller recalled telling mr. beilin when he picked him up at the airport for a conference in geneva in 2001. ''if we provide you with the means and support -- logistical and financial -- would you agree to meet secretly in switzerland to finalize taba?'' taba, egypt, was the site of discussions between israeli and palestinian negotiators in january 2001 that built on negotiations at camp david six months before and where progress was made in narrowing differences between the sides. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. when mr. beilin accepted, and showed

Article 5 - trump’s threat to cut palestinian aid worries many in israel
“we will not be blackmailed,” hanan ashrawi, a senior palestinian official, said in a statement on wednesday. “president trump has sabotaged our search for peace, freedom and justice. now he dares to blame the palestinians for the consequences of his own irresponsible actions!” nabil abu rudeineh, a spokesman for mahmoud abbas, the president of the palestinian authority, was also angry. “jerusalem and its holy places are not for sale,’’ he said, “not with gold nor with silver.” for israelis, too, mr. trump’s tweets presented a problem and, inscrutable as a talmudic text in parts, were left open to some feverish interpretation. mr. trump was unclear about what funding he would cut and said that his administration had “taken jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table.” the statement appeared to contradict his own assurances, and those of other american officials, that the boundaries of israeli sovereignty within jerusalem were still up for discussion. he also said that the israelis “would have had to pay more” for the recognition of their capital, suggesting that the country would have had to reciprocate with significant concessions to the palestinians. the relationship between israel and the united nations relief and works agency is complicated. israel has accused the agency of perpetuating the palestinian refugee problem, while at the same time

Article 6 - strengthening extremists
now when he hears of extremists firing rockets at southern israeli towns like sderot, mr. sharif has a warm feeling all over. when hamas won democratic elections in gaza and then seized full power a year ago, there were no good choices for israel and america. hamas includes terrorists, islamic fundamentalists and ideologues, and it has cultivated ties with iran. it has decent governance by the region’s devalued standards — it is not particularly corrupt; it delivers social services efficiently, and the streets are safe — but it runs a police state and alarms all its neighbors. of all the bad choices, israel chose perhaps the worst. punishing everyone in gaza radicalized the population, cast hamas as a victim, gave its officials an excuse for economic failures and undermined the moderates who are the best hope of both israel and the arab world. if the u.s. and israel had formed a joint commission to support hamas extremists and bolster iranian influence, they could hardly have done a better job. the episode is the latest evidence that hard-liners in israel, palestine and america all reinforce each other. arab terrorism led to the rise of israeli hawks and to two invasions of lebanon. the first israeli invasion helped give birth to hezbollah, and then the israeli assaults on palestinian police helped nurture hamas. so while israelis denounce hezbollah and

Article 7 - israel is steadfast in criticism of nuclear deal
it was the first response from an israeli official to mr. kerry’s remarks, which occurred shortly before the jewish sabbath began in israel. american officials insisted on saturday that mr. kerry had never intended to threaten israel and were careful not to repeat his observation that israel might be blamed if congress stops the accord from being enacted. “secretary kerry issued no threats,” said john kirby, the state department spokesman. “he simply stated a fact: should the u.s. congress fail to support the deal, it will fall apart, and so, too, will any international support for further sanctions on iran and its nuclear program. iran will thus be able to start rushing its nuclear program forward again.” in his friday comments, mr. kerry also argued that the nuclear agreement, which would limit iran’s nuclear program for more than 10 years, was overwhelmingly in israel’s interest. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. “we’re gaining a safety and security, i believe, for israel and the region that no alternative presents,” said mr. kerry,

Article 8 - as investigations intensify, israel imagines life after netanyahu
mr. netanyahu has fought off swirling scandals for much of his public life, but experts say that friday’s signing of a state’s witness agreement by ari harow, who served as mr. netanyahu’s chief of staff and directed his 2015 re-election campaign, could be a game changer. mr. harow was offered a light sentence in an unrelated matter in return for information about mr. netanyahu in what the police have called case 1000 and case 2000. photo in case 1000, investigators are looking at whether mr. netanyahu offered favors in return for gifts of expensive cigars, pink champagne and other goods from wealthy friends, including arnon milchan, the israeli hollywood producer. case 2000 involves back-room dealings with a local newspaper magnate. mr. netanyahu was recorded negotiating with the publisher of yedioth ahronoth for favorable coverage in exchange for curtailing the circulation of a free competitor, israel hayom. the police came across recordings of mr. netanyahu’s talks with the newspaper while searching mr. harow’s belongings, the israeli news media has reported. mr. hendel, who worked in the prime minister’s office during the first of mr. harow’s two stints there, said mr. harow worked in the “very broad, gray area” between mr. netanyahu’s personal, familial and national obligations. he added, “someone like ari would see it

Title: rice says houses hurt mideast talks
Content: despite her concerns, she said she was impressed at the depth and seriousness of the negotiations. she also addressed the growing skepticism of the chances of success. “i can’t say yes, absolutely, they will get an agreement,” ms. rice said. “no one can say that. but the idea that they have no chance of getting an agreement by the end of the year, i just think is not right.” on the palestinian winners of the fulbright award, the american government’s flagship international education study grant, israel permitted four students to exit gaza, but told three others that they were security risks and could not enter israel in order to fly to the united states. the israelis declined to give details of their concerns to the students or to journalists, but they did say they were sharing them with american officials. “it continues to be my belief that all of the fulbrights should be able to take up their fellowships,” ms. rice said. “i consider this to be a very high priority to get this resolved.” maj. peter lerner, spokesman for the section of israel’s defense ministry that handles palestinian civilian affairs, said shin bet, the internal security service, had determined that the three students were sufficient risks that they could not leave gaza and enter israel. israel’s policy toward gaza is to bar all but emergency humanitarian movement in and out to pressure hamas, the governing party. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. but the american government had vetted all of the fulbright winners for security as well as for academic achievement. ms. rice said that unless there was something significant she did not know about the three men that the israelis could present to her, she wanted them to be permitted to leave. the three — zuhair abu shaaban, 24, osama dawoud, 25, and fidaa abed, 23 — studied at the islamic university of gaza, a hamas stronghold, which is perhaps the reason israel has concerns about them. but all said in interviews on sunday that they had studied there because it was the only institution in gaza that offered the engineering fields they wanted to pursue and that they had never been involved in hamas or politics of any kind. “i don’t support hamas,” mr. dawoud said. he is hoping to be able to accept the offer to study for a doctorate in environmental engineering at the university of utah. mr. abu shaaban, who has been accepted into a master’s program in electrical engineering at the university

",0.9
3681301.0,fake,reliable,0.9,105.05920648574828,False," The article's content and language align closely with the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, particularly in its discussion of global debt levels, interest payments, and market bubbles. The article highlights the substitution of debt for income as a key issue, which is also mentioned in the reliable summary. Additionally, the article mentions the potential economic collapse due to unsustainable debt burdens, which is supported by the reliable summary's warning about the need for significant interest payments.  The only discrepancy between the article and the reliable summary is the mention of billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller in the fake news summary, which is not present in the article. However, this does not significantly impact my confidence in the classification.  Overall, I believe that the article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY due to its focus on economic indicators, debt levels, and market bubbles, making it a reliable source of information.","Global debt levels have reached unprecedented highs, with the US national debt alone exceeding $20 trillion. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller warns that this excessive leverage is setting up a disaster, citing high net cash flow deficits and rising debt. He attributes the problem to central banks' easy money policies and corporate focus on short-term gains.

The global economy faces significant challenges, including deflation for commodities and potential discontinuity. Economists warn of an unsustainable debt burden, with some estimates suggesting that interest payments alone could require a 300% increase in GDP.

The US dollar has fallen by 33% since 2000, and projected outlays for entitlements and interest on the national debt will consume all tax revenues by 2025. The global economy is propped up by debt-fueled spending, with corporate and personal debt levels also at record highs.

Experts warn of a potential economic collapse, citing the $200 trillion global debt load and the need for significant interest payments to cover this burden. Some believe that the current debt super cycle began over 100 years ago and will eventually lead to catastrophic consequences.

Article 1 - billionaire druckenmiller says global debt-fueled disaster is ahead
billionaire druckenmiller says global debt-fueled disaster is ahead % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) stanley druckenmiller, head of duquesne capital, thinks that the macroeconomy is looking disastrous and there are two sources for the coming problems. druckenmiller thinks that leverage is far too high, saying that central banks and china have allowed for these excesses to continue and it’s setting us up for danger. the obsession with short-term gains is overwhelming the need for long-term reform at the federal reserve, he said. “it’s this kind of myopia that causes reckless behavior at the government and corporate level,” said druckenmiller. he highlighted that net cash flow has gone negative while net debt is still climbing at an unprecedented rate. he also said that instead of investing in growth, companies are adding the debt for financial engineering like buybacks and m&a. the corporate sector is stuck in a “vicious cycle” of chasing earnings and adding debt, he said …. http://www.businessinsider.com the corporate sector is stuck in a “vicious cycle” of chasing earnings and adding debt, he said source: http://luismmx.blogspot.com/2016/05/billionaire-druckenmiller-says-global.html

Article 2 - inflation, deflation, or discontinuity?
inflation, deflation, or discontinuity? (before it's news) a question that seems to come up quite often is, “are we going to have inflation or deflation?” people want to figure out how to invest. because of this, they want to know whether to expect a rise in prices, or a fall in prices, either in general, or in commodities, in the future. the traditional “peak oil” response to this question has been that oil prices will tend to rise over time. there will not be enough oil available, so demand will outstrip supply. as a result, prices will rise both for oil and for food which depends on oil. i see things differently. i think the issue ahead is deflation for commodities as well as for other types of assets. at some point, deflation may “morph” into discontinuity. it is the fact that price falls too low that will ultimately cut off oil production, not the lack of oil in the ground. even with little oil, there will still be some goods and services produced. these goods and services will not necessarily be available to holders of assets of the kind we have today. instead, they will tend to go to those who produced them, and to those who win them by fighting over them. up and down escalator economies it seems to me that economies operate on two kinds of escalators–an up escalator, and a down escalator. the up escalator is driven by a favorable feedback

Article 3 - how sound money principles can bolster your personal finances
how sound money principles can bolster your personal finances (before it's news) sound money principles can serve to help grow the economy and restrain government. the political class, however, doesn’t particularly want to restrain itself. washington, d.c. is addicted to the easy money policies that have enabled $$20 trillion in national debt accumulation and tens of trillions more in unfunded liabilities. even with a new and unconventional gop president who vows to take on waste and overregulation, the built-in momentum of “mandatory” spending means the trump budgets won’t be balanced. the debt will keep growing – and likely at a faster pace than the economy. thus, political demand for the federal reserve’s artificially low interest rates and treasury bond purchases will continue to be strong. short of a currency crisis that forces a monetary revolution, sound money reform efforts will have to proceed in baby steps. any fundamental proposed changes – such as tying the currency supply to gold and silver reserves – will encounter enormous resistance from congress, the federal reserve, and its member banks. a metallic standard would also be roundly opposed by wall street, which benefits from the fed’s artificial inflation of the financial sector. you don’t have to wait for the politicians… even if the current monetary order proves too well entrenched to be upended within your lifetime, sound dollar principles can still be valuable to you and your family. apply some of the timeless lessons of honest money to your personal finances, and you’ll avoid dangerous pitfalls while protecting and growing

Article 4 - babylon = usury! we want interest-free money!
babylon = usury! we want interest-free money! % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) usury is the original sin in the economic sphere and the root cause of all our economic problems. it causes unfathomable suffering. it is so pervasive, so normalized, it seems unavoidable. the truth is we have everything we need to create an interest-free money supply and eradicate usury and associated rent-seeking completely from our economic and social lives. a usury-free economy ends poverty and brings abundance to the many. it will save our souls in the process. by anthony migchels for henry makow and real currencies the love of money is the root of many evils. usury is the weaponization of the love of money. it feeds the avarice of the usurer. it forces ever more debtors into ever more immoral behavior. it replaces love with commerce. it corrupts commerce, which becomes ever more exploitative to pay off ever higher interest charges. it is the foundation of rent-seeking. it rips apart the fabric of society. it makes a mockery of any kind of social contract. it causes hunger. bankruptcies. intense stress in families. weighs especially heavily on the poor and leads to all sorts of excesses at the top. billions of people live in abject poverty all over the world because of it. entire communities, nations are gutted to pay the interest to the opulent.

Article 5 - world economic collapse explained in 3 minutes
world economic collapse explained in 3 minutes (before it's news) the first thing i want to say is that if you are in the stock market right now, it might be wise to get out now, or you are likely to lose your savings again like so many did in the crash of 2008. the numbers may drop as far or worse than the last crash and the value of stocks adjusted for inflation are likely to be far worse. do market conditions in the world justify the present stock market? i think not. it is just more betting on an expanding bubble like it will not burst on their bet. the eu nations are in the longest recession in their history and there is no end in sight. japan is in recession and has not had any growth in almost two decades. greece has 30 percent unemployment and they burned city trees last winter for heat. riots are inevitable. spain, france and italy and others are not far behind and fascism is rising in many eu nations. japan had the highest savings rate and also has the worst national debt burden is the world. the population is rapidly aging so now the elderly will tap into savings and banks will fail or buy-in’s will rob savers to bail out the banks like what happened in cyprus. japan has not seen any growth in nearly two decades and it is recession once again. the solution the japanese came up with in 2013 to get them out of stagnation is to aggressively print money. that will just

Article 7 - the economy: “anarchy from above”
(before it's news) “anarchy from above” by brian maher “g.k. chesterton once warned about “anarchy from above.” think of anarchy and its mobs and molotov cocktails. but as chesterton wrote, “it isn’t necessary that anarchy should be violent; nor is it necessary that it should come from below.” and the golden nugget: “a government may grow anarchic as much as a people.” desperation is the natural breeding ground of anarchy. and governments are sweating lead over the fading global economy. their central banks have already shelled it with $$60 trillion worth of debt since 2009. only under such a furious barrage of debt can the economy possibly recover, the theory being. and now the world’s debt load, public and private, weighs in mountain-high at $$200 trillion- almost three times the size of the global economy. economist james dale davidson crunched the numbers. assume the interest on this $$200 trillion is 2 %, he says. that means the economy would have to grow by 6%- 300% of gdp- to simply cover the interest charge on the outstanding debt. and that, according to davidson, implies a $$500 billion annual deficit. there’s a word describing an economy growing at less than half the rate to meet its debt load: unsustainable. now that the central banks have emptied the magazines to fight the great recession, there’s no powder to battle the next

Article 1 - new respect is bestowed on fiscal policy
meanwhile, countries that ignored their deficit problems, as did the united states for most of the post-crisis period, or where governments decided to play down their fiscal tightening plans, as did britain this year or japan in 2013, have generally done better, in terms of both economics and finance. the one major exception has been germany, where budgetary consolidation has managed to coexist with decent growth, largely because of a boom in machinery exports to russia and china. that boom is now over, pushing germany back into the recession that its stringent policy suggested all along. thus the six years since 2008 have provided strong empirical support for the supposedly outdated keynesian view that government borrowing is at least as powerful as monetary policy in stimulating depressed economies and pulling them out of recession. recessions generally occur when private businesses and households decide to spend less than their incomes to reduce their debts or increase their savings. if this process of “deleveraging” is happening in the private sector — which it clearly has been — then simple arithmetic shows that economic balance can be restored only if some other sector of the economy spends more than its income. disregarding the role of exports and imports, which must balance out to zero for the world as a whole, the government is the only possible candidate to play the crucial balancing role of the “other sector.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter

Article 2 - the rules nasdaq forgot
the story is told of two economists on their way to lunch who spot what appears to be a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk. when the younger economist stoops to pick up the bill, his older colleague restrains him, saying, ''that can't be a $100 dollar bill.'' ''why not?'' asks the younger colleague. ''if it were,'' comes the reply, ''someone would have picked it up by now.'' the older economist might have been wrong about that particular bill, of course. yet his admonition embodies an important truth that americans seem increasingly determined to ignore -- namely, that low-hanging fruit in public places gets picked very quickly. as in the past, the only way to make real money in the future will be through some combination of talent, thrift, hard work and luck. tens of millions of americans, however, now seem to believe they can get rich in a hurry by simply transferring their money from old-economy stocks, like general motors or procter & gamble, into oracle, cisco systems and other high-tech stocks that have led the nasdaq index. advertisement continue reading the main story so far that strategy has worked like a charm. someone who invested $100,000 in the nasdaq index in january 1992 is now holding shares that are worth more than $850,000, and that takes this week's ups and downs into account. many bullish analysts insist that the ride is far from over, and no one can

Article 3 - every market collapse is different
this is an extraordinary period for american investors. caution should be their compass. it would be an error to expect a speedy correction like the one that followed the last major stock market implosion. fifteen years ago president ronald reagan asked me to head the commission to examine the market crash of october 1987. from the close of trading on oct. 13, 1987, to the close of trading on oct. 19, 1987, the dow jones industrial average fell 769 points, or 31 percent. in those four days of trading, the value of all outstanding united states stocks decreased by almost $1 trillion. on oct. 19 alone, the dow fell by 508 points, or 22.6 percent. only the crash of 1929 approaches the 1987 decline in magnitude. the conclusion we reached in the fall of 1987 was that the market was not equipped to handle the volume that arose so suddenly. the recommendations of our report -- improved clearance and settlement procedures, the adoption of circuit breakers and an increase in capacity -- were put into place. the crash was the result of a structural problem. valuations were not the culprit. the present market collapse is different; it was caused by vastly overblown valuations. the stock market has been in a colossal bubble, a delusion born in the late 1990's that reached its zenith in 2000. while not common, bubbles have always been a

Article 4 - reversal of fortunes
the domestic aspect of casey’s story is more convincing, but also more familiar. american finance is broken, our regulations don’t seem to be working and the economic incentives too often are “heads i win, tails society loses.” one can agree with casey’s call for greater transparency, smaller banks, floating exchange rates, reforming the international monetary fund and limiting the oligarchic power of bankers without expecting very much to change. our pre-2008 institutions were, arguably, the result of an attempt to build a financial world on exactly those principles, which have commanded various forms of lip service for decades. the more pressing question is whether our economy is strong enough to tolerate a slowdown in borrowing from both consumers and the federal government. many observers fear not, and in any case american politicians, ever conscious of their own re-­election prospects, do not seem willing to run the experiment. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. daniel gross, an editor and columnist at the daily ticker at yahoo! finance, offers a much more optimistic view of the future, at least for the united states. in “better, stronger,

Article 5 - dollars without borders
the growing power of capital explains many of the economic stories of our day: why wall street has the whip hand over corporate performance; why the gap between executive and worker pay has widened to record levels; why even incompetent executives enjoy golden parachutes while high-performing employees can be laid off without apology. it also explains why the american labor movement is a pitiful shadow of its former self, the victim of a ""china price"" set half a world away by a seemingly limitless supply of cheap labor. most disturbing of all, faux argues, this imbalance is largely america's own doing. and if we don't change, he says, it could well be our undoing. how did things go wrong? well, they didn't entirely, as faux himself concedes. the post-cold-war period has also been one of significant global growth. the problems arose in the 1980's when neoliberals in washington, inspired by the ideas of friedrich hayek and milton friedman, began promoting free markets over keynesian ""statist"" thinking. in the new era of globalization, the prevailing ideology became, once again, the laissez-faire absolutism of the gold-standard era. yet crucially, faux argues, this thinking was applied only abroad. ""friedman and hayek failed to overturn keynes on the question of how to run a national economy,"" he writes. not only did democrats and republicans alike continue to practice keynesianism at home

Article 6 - unreal 'real' figures and other good news
is it just war and terrorism worries? or is there something fundamentally wrong with the economy? the most revealing part of alan greenspan's congressional testimony this week came when he tackled the issue of what happens to the economy when the war with iraq is over. if geopolitical ''uncertainties diminish considerably in the near term,'' mr. greenspan said, ''we should be able to tell far better whether we are dealing with a business sector and an economy poised to grow more rapidly -- our more probable expectation -- or one that is still laboring under persisting strains and imbalances that have been misidentified as transitory.'' in other words, is the burst bubble still causing damage that an easy monetary policy cannot solve? that is an important question for mr. greenspan's legacy, and his legacy should be far more important to him than the question of whether president bush will offer him another term as federal reserve chairman in 2004. when stocks were soaring, mr. greenspan cited estimates by wall street analysts to justify high-technology stock prices and promised that the fed would be able to handle any economic problems if a bubble were to burst. but after the bubble did burst, neither mr. greenspan nor the bush administration appears to have understood the extent to which the bubble had inflated tax revenue -- largely through taxes on capital gains and stock options -- and did not realize how rapidly tax receipts were going to decline. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. greenspan has kept his rose-colored glasses

Article 7 - the chatter
''debt collectors and credit reporting agencies have gone unsupervised by the federal government for too long.'' richard cordray, director of the consumer financial protection bureau, which proposed regulations that would allow it to supervise those two corners of the finance industry. ''it is patently wrong for young people to have such a poor start in life.'' hilary steedman, an economist at the london school of economics. britain's unemployment rate among young people has soared, and critics say the country has not financed enough job training and apprentice programs for those who don't go to college.

Article 8 - the nation: vertigo; econ 2001: tips for the shellshocked
whatever this period is -- a recession or a slowdown -- it could be over quickly because the problems and solutions are much more immediately evident than in the past. but the downturn could well turn out to be more extended than in previous cycles. according to one theory making the rounds, this cycle is not so much about demand exceeding supply -- the usual trigger for inflation -- but about overinvestment by businesses in technology, equipment and factories. in short, the problem may not be too much money chasing too few goods, as in the past; indeed, this cycle has been characterized by an almost total lack of inflation. rather, it may be too much investment chasing too little return. in that case, the economy might not get back on its feet until businesses begin investing heavily again, and they won't do that until they work off their overcapacity. and that process could be delayed by consumers, whose confidence has been eroding. individuals helped fuel the investment boom by sinking their money into stocks rather than savings accounts. but now they find themselves with shrinking portfolios, heavy debt loads and little in the way of a buffer to help them through tough times. some economists think the idea of overinvestment leading to a sustained downturn is exaggerated. but others say recent corporate announcements of steep reductions in capital spending, plus faltering sales and profits among technology companies, suggest there is something to the notion. lesson no. 2: if productivity fades, we're toast. perhaps the most fundamental question facing the economy is whether the

(before it's news) be prepared for the next great transfer of wealth. buy physical silver and storable food. by charles hugh smith of two minds the bottom line is the fed can only keep the machine duct-taped together by suppressing the market’s pricing of risk. one of the grand narratives of our era is the substitution of debt for income: as earned income and disposable income have stagnated for 40 years, the gap between the rising cost of living and stagnant household income has been filled by borrowed money. money has been borrowed to replace income everywhere: consumers have borrowed money to buy things they otherwise couldn’t afford, students have borrowed over $$1 trillion to attend college, governments have borrowed money to fund wars and social spending, corporations have borrowed money to buy back their own shares, pushing stock prices higher. there’s one little problem with debt: interest must be paid on debt. let’s focus for a second on the difference between cash income and borrowing money. cash doesn’t cost money to maintain; debt does. in a functioning economy (as opposed to the dysfunctional mess we have now), cash would earn income from interest paid by borrowers. continue reading at oftwominds.com… source: http://silveristhenew.com/2014/06/30/the-next-global-meltdown-is-baked-in-connecting-the-dots-between-oil-debt-interest-rates-and-risk/

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Global debt levels have reached unprecedented highs, with the US national debt alone exceeding $20 trillion. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller warns that this excessive leverage is setting up a disaster, citing high net cash flow deficits and rising debt. He attributes the problem to central banks' easy money policies and corporate focus on short-term gains.

The global economy faces significant challenges, including deflation for commodities and potential discontinuity. Economists warn of an unsustainable debt burden, with some estimates suggesting that interest payments alone could require a 300% increase in GDP.

The US dollar has fallen by 33% since 2000, and projected outlays for entitlements and interest on the national debt will consume all tax revenues by 2025. The global economy is propped up by debt-fueled spending, with corporate and personal debt levels also at record highs.

Experts warn of a potential economic collapse, citing the $200 trillion global debt load and the need for significant interest payments to cover this burden. Some believe that the current debt super cycle began over 100 years ago and will eventually lead to catastrophic consequences.

The US has reduced its national debt by $12 billion under the Trump administration, but experts argue that this is a small drop in the bucket compared to the overall debt levels. The global economy faces significant challenges, including recession, unemployment, and potential social unrest.

Article 1 - nick gillespie and veronique de rugy on old-age entitlements vs. the safety net
(before it's news) in 1964 a young bob dylan released “the times they are a-changin’,” an anthem that defined what would shortly become known as “the generation gap.” with a mix of sympathy and sneer—“come mothers and fathers / throughout the land / and don’t criticize / what you can’t understand / your sons and your daughters / are beyond your command / your old road is / rapidly agin’ ”—dylan described an unbridgeable gulf in values, styles, and aspirations between the rising baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, and their elders, who had managed to survive the depredations of the great depression, world war ii, and the swiveling hips of elvis presley. flash forward half a century, and the boomers who once sang along with dylan have become the reactionary elders, clinging to their power and perks at the literal expense of everyone younger. there’s a new generation gap opening up, write nick gillespie and veronique de rugy, one that threatens to tear apart the country every bit as much as past confrontations over war, free love, drugs, and sitar music. this fight is about old-age entitlements and whether the me generation will do what’s right for the country and stop sucking up more and more money from their children and grandchildren. view this article.

(before it's news) songs and lyrics come in all shapes and styles. you have songs that make you happy or nostalgic for earlier days. you have songs that inspire and make you feel good about the world. you also have songs that make you sad and touch you deep inside. these are my “favorite” sad tunes. the first song is skeeter davis singing “the end of the world”. it started out as a country hit but quickly went to the pop charts too. it continues to get a lot of airplay on the radio even though skeeter davis died in 2004. it was her biggest hit and still resonates with the ”brokenhearted”. this is my “vote” for the saddest song ever recorded: “why does the sun go on shining? why does the sea rush to shore? don’t they know it’s the end of the world, ‘cause you don’t love me any more? why do the birds go on singing? why do the stars glow above? don’t they know it’s the end of the world. it ended when i lost your love. i wake up in the morning and i wonder, why everything’s the same as it was. i can’t understand. no, i can’t understand, how life goes on the way it does. why does my heart go on beating? why do these eyes of mine cry? don’t they know it’s the end of the world. it

Article 5 - kesha’s video “praying” is said to be “liberating” … it is actually about her remaining an industry slave
while praying is said to be a “liberating” song that addresses kesha’s painful past with her producer dr. luke, the video tells a whole other story. indeed, through symbolism, the video implies that kesha is still an industry slave … because that’s what she actually is. for years, kesha has been displaying all of the “symptoms” of a music industry slave. at an early age, the singer got locked into an airtight contract with sony music, under dr. luke’s label kemosabe. since then, she’s had little to no control over her professional career and personal life. like most industry slaves, kesha’s work has been replete with elite symbolism and infused with a foul, dehumanizing agenda. for example, her 2012 video die young (analyzed in this article), featured the singer repeating “we’re gonna die young” as satanic images flashed on screen. the entire thing was so blatant that even mainstream magazines such as billboard had to admit that the video was all about illuminati symbolism: “according to billboard, the video is a shout-out to the illuminati. occult symbols ubiquitously associated with the secret society such as the all-seeing eye of horus, inverted crosses, pentagrams, and triangles pervade the video.” – wikipedia, die young as if to confirm the bad omen of the song, die young was released only days prior to the sandy hook shooting,

Article 6 - award-winning band herrick releases new album cottonfields
award-winning band herrick releases new album cottonfields % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) they are award-winning, and dancing on a multi-genre musical radar. and now, after the trendsetting self-made album, new dance, herrick is back with another ballsy opus. cottonfields was produced by herrick and veteran producer david walker. vocalist donna herrick, along with husband and bass player, kerry herrick, guitarist jefferson rogers, and drummer jeff bradshaw, began writing for the album in early 2014. the result is an collection that offers a panoramic sonic experience, with a variety of themes, all wrapped in characteristic herrick musicianship, showcasing donna’s power vocals with driving harmonies. it is a kind of roots/rock americana music that borders on folk literature. themes of empowerment, freedom, spirituality, the importance of preserving traditions and cultures are woven throughout cottonfields. the title track is authentic american music. it is an intricate mix of primitive music that was brought here by immigrants, wanderers and slaves and was blended into a joyful language that changed the way the world thinks about music. like others before them, herrick explores a variety of musical influences and adds that distinctive herrick touch. “the uniqueness of this project comes not from one or multiple sources or backgrounds, rather, a comradery and respect in combining each of our roots, love of music

Article 7 - changed by rascal flatts review plus a great contest!
(before it's news) recently, i got the opportunity to review “changed”, the latest album from one of my favorite bands, rascal flatts . this is a triumphant release for the band, since the title says it all. rascal flatts have grown and evolved over the years, and have experienced many changes in both their personal and professional lives. they have been featured everywhere, even singing a great song with justin bieber, and they have also become husbands and fathers, needing to find stability and balance between being music men and family men. i don’t know about you, but i love music. i listen to a little bit of everything, from pop and r&b to hard rock to country. the genre means nothing to me, since i look for the meaning behind a song and the emotion conveyed in it. music is all about the human experience, so great messages can be found in every single genre. while i do love a great beat, i am more of a lyrics person, and tend to look deeper than just a groove i can bounce around to. this album is in a word, amazing. there are heartfelt ballads, upbeat songs that make you want to dance, and songs of joy as well as loss. but each and every track on this album is full of the raw emotion rascal flatts is so well known for. the lead vocalist, gary levox, continues to amaze with his rich, soulful voice and incredible vocal range

Article 1 - personal statements: whispered, growled and shouted
emily haines metric, emily haines’s main band, switches between lean guitar-driven rock and the synthesizer pulse of dance music. her debut solo album, “knives don’t have your back” (last gang), builds songs instead around a piano, and she trades metric’s bravado for breathy, moody reflections on love and loneliness: “by the way, it’s over without you. i’m in the way.” in ms. haines’s new songs, romances come apart in painful slow motion. there’s no rancor, but when she ends up singing, alone at the piano, “it’s gone/so long/we’ve got time/all the time,” she’s simply heartbreaking. solomon burke country and soul grew up as neighbors down south: both telling stories, both bending notes for emotion, both touching down in church music and the blues. but country took its instrumentation from string bands and soul from gospel and electric blues. back in the 1960’s ray charles famously turned country songs into orchestrated r&b. now the soul singer solomon burke, 66, has made “nashville” (shout! factory), singing well-chosen country songs backed by nashville musicians in country styles from bluegrass to countrypolitan. singing about lost love and money, he stokes every drama. breakups play as grand tragedies in songs like “does my ring burn your finger” (by jul

Article 2 - denying the imperium of death
the tens of thousands of american deaths from drug overdoses are a measure of the hopeless desperation left behind by the soul-starving socio-economic system of late-stage capitalism, writes poet phil rockstroh. by phil rockstroh according to a nationwide study conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), a greater number of u.s. americans died (approximately 65,000) from drug overdoses last year than were killed during the course of the vietnam war. all part and parcel of capitalism’s war against life itself. the emotional and physical pain, anxiety, and depression inflicted by the trauma inherent to a system sustained by perpetual exploitation has proven to be too much for a sizeable number of human beings to endure thus their need to self-medicate. the root of addiction is trauma. the soul of the nation is a casualty of war. there is not an arlington cemetery for these fallen, no hagiographic ceremonies will be performed over their graves nor statues erected in memoriam. their ghosts will howl through the long, dark night of national denial. listen to their wailing. it is an imprecatory prayer. a curse and augury … that admonishes, our fate and the fate of the nation will converge … as the nation will stagger, keening in lament, to the abyss. the solution: within each of us swells a deathless song. powerful. resonate. piercing. a song, miraculous of influence, plangent with the force

Article 3 - thumping the basics, with amp cranked up
pearl jam’s quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious. no doubt mr. vedder means it when he sings, “fill the air up with love,” or “i’m still holding tight to this dream of distant light.” but pearl jam’s music doesn’t align well with satisfaction. photo muse “the resistance” (warner brothers) big problems, real or imagined, weigh heavily on matthew bellamy’s mind. as the singer and writer of paranoid lyrics for the wildly popular british band muse, he’s honed a worldview centered on apocalyptic and conspiratorial notions. “they’ll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down/and hope that we will never see the truth around,” he wails on the flamboyant “uprising,” the single from the band’s fifth studio album, “the resistance.” but mr. bellamy and his band mates — the drummer dominic howard and the bassist chris wolstenholme, who together form a forceful and convincing rhythm section — are preoccupied with a far more dangerous concept: beauty. and “the resistance,” the crispest muse album yet, is unapologetically and ambitiously beautiful. the band renders its operatic prog-rock without insularity or undue complexity, allowing mr. bellamy’s voice — wide, nervous, seductive — full reign. queen is a clear touchstone here, on “unnatural

Article 4 - a debut juggles genres aplenty
phil vassar ''prayer of a common man'' (universal south) a bruiser with a tender touch at the piano, phil vassar has long been torn between sensitivity and machismo. on ''prayer of a common man,'' this versatile country singer's fourth album, the tug of war is over. the soft has it. few in country focus on feelings quite as intently as mr. vassar, and hanging over the album is the specter of his recent divorce from his songwriter wife, julie, with whom he wrote two heartbreakers here, ''it's only love'' and ''let me love you tonight.'' though there are a couple of jubilant moments on a par with his mischievous 2004 hit ''i'll take that as a yes (the hot tub song)'' -- the 1950s swing of ''why don't ya,'' and the common-man lament ''the world is a mess,'' which sounds transplanted from a broadway stage -- mr. vassar mostly finds ways to be wistful. but while he's an affable vocalist, he's not especially subtle. so there is the occasional disconnect between his often strong songwriting (he began his career as a writer, contributing to no. 1 country hits for stars like tim mcgraw and alan jackson) and his sometimes brusque delivery. ''i would,'' a crisp song about a relationship gone sour, would be

Article 5 - footlong hot dogs of the apocalypse
since world war ii, america’s wealth has sheltered the population from harsh realities that other fellow humans face. but that protection is breaking down, from the greed of the super-rich and the stubborn insistence of many americans to stay focused on their footlong hot dogs and super-gulp drinks, writes phil rockstroh. by phil rockstroh almost exactly ten years ago, in june of 2002, my wife and i were driving through colorado, on our way from los angeles to new york city. in the early afternoon, while paused to tank-up our toyota corolla, at a massive convenience store/self-service gas island that boasted of “two-for-the-price-of-one, one and one half footlong hot dogs,” we watched a family of six emerge from a late model, oversized pickup truck, proceed into the store, and return with a bounty of hot dogs and super-gulp soft drinks. a few minutes later, we passed their vehicle on interstate 70, and i remarked to my wife on the connection between oversized consumer goods, oversized people, and the oversized amount of greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere. i queried, “do you think they would even look up from their titanic hot dogs, if the world before them ignited into flames?” after a few more minutes, my question was answered when a series of wildfires (very much like the ones that are scorching colorado to ash and cinder, as i write these words) began

Article 6 - branden jacobs-jenkins is, and is not, writing about race
the day before i met jacobs-jenkins in new haven, we sat in a borrowed office at the tisch school to talk. he seemed nervous. much of his writing is so self-assured that it’s easy to forget how young he is. “i applied for the fulbright to investigate the stories of the mischlingskinder, the war babies,” he began. “they were a huge problem because they couldn’t blend into the rest of an incredibly homogeneous society. they were walking symbols of defeat.” in “war,” we learn that many of the mischlingskinder were put into orphanages after their fathers left germany. the mothers went on to marry and stopped visiting their children, who no longer fit into their mothers’ lives. also in the play, apes appear throughout. “every time i saw germans making theater that was about race in some way, one of three things would happen,” jacobs-jenkins explained. “one is that people would come out in grass skirts, or two, in blackface with afro wigs, or they would come out in ape costumes. i did a show over there, and it called for a black actor, and the only person they had to play him was a young arab. they put him in a grass skirt. i guess for them that means africa. photo “i saw an ‘othello’ there too, and it was rampant with gorilla imagery. so that was the initial impulse behind my including

Article 7 - rock celebrities by stealth; without trying too hard, the shins have become an indie phenomenon
the first shins album, ''oh, inverted world,'' was released in 2001 by the smallish label sub pop (partly owned by time warner). megan jasper, the general manager of sub pop, remembers that everyone loved the record, but no one expected it to become a hit. ''we were hoping that we would be able to sell about 10,000,'' she said. the album has sold nearly 100,000 copies -- a benchmark that some people call indie platinum -- and sub pop has high hopes for the new shins album, ''chutes too narrow,'' which was released yesterday. there was once a time when indie-rock groups aspired to a mythical kind of solidarity: they were a unit, hanging out together and making music together and often writing songs together. now more than ever, though, much of the energy in indie-rock comes from singer-songwriters; the other band members are there only to help. like chan marshall (who records and performs as cat power) and conor oberst (who leads the free-form collective bright eyes), mr. mercer runs his band a lot like a solo project; the musicians may help with arrangements, but he gets sole publishing credit. it seems appropriate, then, that there were shins songs before there were shins. mr. mercer never went looking for band members; he was living in albuquerque, writing songs, he said, and ''people kept asking to be in the

christmas specials are a dime a dozen, almost making us forget that there are other holidays around that time. thanksgiving movies are not as common, sure, but they still exist! after all, who doesn’t like to see movies on thanksgiving weekend? it’s just such an untapped market! some of these are for the whole family, while others are for more mature audiences, but it’s honestly a matter of opinion. some are dramas, others are musical cartoons and there’s everything in between. miracle on 34th street look, i know what you’re thinking; if the whole thing is about someone who thinks he is santa claus, then it is clearly a christmas movie. still, the opening scene is new york city’s macy’s thanksgiving day parade, so i am counting it. a charlie brown thanksgiving this is probably the first movie many of you thought of when i suggested a thanksgiving movie. these plucky, little peanuts have had a monopoly on holiday specials for at least four decades. they even had an arbor day special. addams family values i’m still not sure why a summer camp puts on a thanksgiving play in the first place, but this still ends up making a really good scene. added to that, it’s nice to know that we have a good reason to watch america’s favorite family even after halloween. hannah and her sisters it starts on thanksgiving. it ends on thanksgiving. i even think there’s

Article 4 - bummer: climate change to end practice of turkey for thanksgiving
bummer: climate change to end practice of turkey for thanksgiving (before it's news) why, yes, it is that time of the year when the climatologists trot out their scary thanksgiving stories. prior to most major holidays, and some minor ones, warmists tend to take one of three tracks: climate change will ruin the holiday, the holiday makes climate change worse, or they use the holiday to spread awareness. in this case thanksgiving in the future: no turkeys, lots of pensioners, and robot cooks welcome to thanksgiving in the future, a festive look at how we’ll be experiencing turkey day 50 years from now. we’ll have to rechristen it chicken day, because climate change will have wiped out the planet’s turkeys by then. and instead of car jams and snow flurries, you’ll whiz through a ”hyperloop” tunnel and make it to the (unseasonably warm) celebrations in good time. plus, you won’t need to snapchat your friends shots of stuffing and cranberry sauce, because one wink will prompt your google glasses to broadcast a panoramic live feed out to everyone you’ve listed as “close friend.” welcome to the last thursday in november of 2063. now, you’ve never seen a turkey, because all farm animals have pretty much gone extinct. but you’ve seen that episode of that vintage show friends where monica wears one on her head, and don’t get what all the nostalgia

The topic of lost and missing books of the Bible has been a subject of interest. Various articles discuss this theme, but none provide conclusive evidence or definitive answers.

Key points:

- The concept of lost or missing books in the Bible is often attributed to the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation.
- Scholars have identified several texts that were likely included in the Septuagint but are now considered apocryphal or non-canonical.
- Some articles suggest these texts may have been intentionally omitted from the canon by early Christian leaders.
- Others propose alternative explanations for their disappearance, such as loss due to war, destruction, or deliberate suppression.

Notable mentions include:

- The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which included fragments of several biblical books and apocryphal texts.
- The identification of the lost book of Enoch, which is now considered part of the canonical Apocrypha.
- Debates among scholars regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain texts in the biblical canon.

The discussion surrounding these lost books highlights ongoing scholarly debates about the nature of biblical authority and the process of canonization.","A 7th-century European gospel, the St. Cuthbert Gospel, has been acquired by the British Library for $14 million. The manuscript, a copy of the Gospel of John, was placed in a coffin and rediscovered in 1104. It is considered one of the world's most important books.

Best-selling authors Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have had their winning streak snapped with their new book ""The Rising,"" which debuted at No. 2 on the Times Hardcover Fiction List. The book tells the story of the birth of the Antichrist to a literature professor named Marilena.

A new book, ""The Last Testament,"" has been released and claims to be a message from God transcribed by David Javerbaum. The book warns that when Italy stops being shaped like a boot, Armageddon will be near. It also lists other books as part of the same series.

Children's chapter books have topped the list this week, with ""The Son of Neptune"" by Rick Riordan at No. 1 and ""Every Thing on It"" by Shel Silverstein at No. 2. Other best-sellers include ""The Lost Hero"" by Rick Riordan and ""Wonderstruck"" by Brian Selznick.

A new book in the Left Behind series, ""The Glorious Appearing,"" has sold out of its initial print run of 1.9 million copies before its release on March 30. The book is expected to be a top-seller for the year.

Best-selling authors Dan Brown and Mitch Albom have had books at the top of the list this week, with ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown at No. 1 and ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" by Mitch Albom at No. 2.

Other best-sellers include ""White Hot"" by Sandra Brown, ""Skinny Dip"" by Carl Hiaasen, and ""Angels & Demons"" by Dan Brown.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

a seventh-century gospel discovered in a saint’s coffin more than 900 years ago, and the oldest european book to survive fully intact, has been acquired by the british library for $14 million, the library said. the book, a manuscript copy of the gospel of john called the st. cuthbert gospel, was placed in cuthbert’s coffin, probably in 698, and rediscovered there in 1104. “it is undoubtedly one of the world’s most important books,” said scot mckendrick of the british library. the book was sold by the society of jesus.

Article 2 - tbr: inside the list
god squad: tim lahaye and jerry b. jenkins, the authors of the apocalyptic thrillers in the ""left behind"" series, have had their winning streak snapped. the pair's previous six novels all entered the times hardcover fiction list at no. 1; their new one, ""the rising,"" makes its debut this week at no. 2, behind james patterson and howard roughan's ""honeymoon."" lahaye and jenkins's new book tells the not-so-cheerful story of the birth of the antichrist to a literature professor named marilena; it's the first of three planned prequels to the events of the first book in the ""left behind"" series. ""the rising"" may not have landed at no. 1, but lahaye and jenkins remain an outsize force in the publishing world. the previous 12 books in the ""left behind"" series have sold more than 40 million copies; these guys have even sponsored a truck on nascar's craftsman truck series circuit. (this was probably a doomed experiment; who wanted to drive a race truck with the words ""left behind"" stamped on it?) lahaye and jenkins have not been bothered by critics who find their books anti-catholic, anti-jewish and anti-united nations, or by those who've pointed out that their prose does not exactly crackle and pop.

he hates the ten commandments “in exactly the same way don mclean hates ‘american pie.’ ” he adores the most obscure and antiquated old testament strictures, “for each outdated relic of an obsolete mode of living is like a child to me.” he identifies himself as “maker of little green apples; rester of merry gentlemen; and sole knower of the beach boys.” he inflicted the potato famine on ireland because he was angry at the potatoes. why? “they know why.” in “the last testament” this divine author warns that when italy stops being shaped like a boot and starts looking like a ballet flat, armageddon will be near. the bad news is that the end may come as soon as next december. but the good news, supposedly, is that buying “the last testament” can save us. with a sales pitch that stops just short of “don’t turn the page, or we’ll shoot this dog,” the big guy notes that if a sequel needs to be written, the apocalypse can be postponed for a while. in listing other books “by the same authors,” “the last testament” ticks off two “daily show” productions (“america” and “earth”) as well as the old testament, new testament and the koran. that is because “the last testament” is billed as a message from god as transcribed by david javerbaum, the former head writer and executive producer of “the daily show with jon st

Content: whatever happened to all those lost and missing books of the bible?

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
A 7th-century European gospel, the St. Cuthbert Gospel, has been acquired by the British Library for $14 million. The manuscript, a copy of the Gospel of John, was placed in a coffin and rediscovered in 1104. It is considered one of the world's most important books.

Best-selling authors Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have had their winning streak snapped with their new book ""The Rising,"" which debuted at No. 2 on the Times Hardcover Fiction List. The book tells the story of the birth of the Antichrist to a literature professor named Marilena.

A new book, ""The Last Testament,"" has been released and claims to be a message from God transcribed by David Javerbaum. The book warns that when Italy stops being shaped like a boot, Armageddon will be near. It also lists other books as part of the same series.

Children's chapter books have topped the list this week, with ""The Son of Neptune"" by Rick Riordan at No. 1 and ""Every Thing on It"" by Shel Silverstein at No. 2. Other best-sellers include ""The Lost Hero"" by Rick Riordan and ""Wonderstruck"" by Brian Selznick.

A new book in the Left Behind series, ""The Glorious Appearing,"" has sold out of its initial print run of 1.9 million copies before its release on March 30. The book is expected to be

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY

Summary:
The topic of lost and missing books of the Bible has been a subject of interest. Various articles discuss this theme, but none provide conclusive evidence or definitive answers.

Key points:

- The concept of lost or missing books in the Bible is often attributed to the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation.
- Scholars have identified several texts that were likely included in the Septuagint but are now considered apocryphal or non-canonical.
- Some articles suggest these texts may have been intentionally omitted from the canon by early Christian leaders.
- Others propose alternative explanations for their disappearance, such as loss due to war, destruction, or deliberate suppression.

Notable mentions include:

- The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which included fragments of several biblical books and apocryphal texts.
- The identification of the lost book of Enoch, which is now considered part of the canonical Apocrypha.
- Debates among scholars regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain texts in the biblical canon.

The discussion surrounding these lost books highlights ongoing scholarly debates about the nature of biblical authority and the process of canonization.
    
TASK
___
Based on the summaries above, determine if the article is FAKE NEWS or RELIABLE NEWS.

Consider:
1. Which summary better aligns with the facts in the article?
2. Are there contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary?
3. Does the article contain claims that are supported by the summary?
    
Respond with:
- Classification: [FAKE/RELIABLE]. This should be ""FAKE"" if the article best matches the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY, and ""RELIABLE"" if the article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.
- Confidence: [0.0-1.0]   This should be a number between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence in your classification.
- Reasoning: [Brief explanation of your decision]

",0.1
8481600.0,reliable,reliable,0.9,105.38082242012024,True," The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY for several reasons:  1. The article discusses a specific budget plan proposed by Governor Pataki, which is mentioned in both summaries. However, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY provides more details about the plan and its implications. 2. Both summaries mention the legislature's efforts to pass a budget despite partisan differences. This is consistent with the article, which states that the Democrat-led Assembly and Republican-led Senate overcame their differences to pass a stripped-down plan. 3. The article mentions specific programs affected by the budget cuts, such as Medicaid payments and day care for the working poor, which are also mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.  The only potential discrepancy is the mention of Governor Andrew Cuomo in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, whereas the article does not mention him at all. However, this can be attributed to the fact that the article was written before Cuomo's governorship began (he took office in 2011).  There are no clear contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary. The claims made in the article are supported by the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.  Overall, based on these observations, I am confident that the article is a reliable news source.","Key points from recent articles include:

* Politicians have proposed various budget reduction plans, with some criticizing them as not nuanced enough.
* Governor Palin appeared on Fox Business Network and took a swipe at Chris Christie, saying he has no choice but to cut budgets due to his state's financial situation.
* Charlie Crist signed a $2.2 billion tax increase in 2009, breaking his pledge against raising taxes.
* The Connecticut budget passed with a $2 billion tax increase, despite Republican efforts to balance the budget through spending cuts.
* Michael Michaud and President Obama have been criticized for shirking their duties to address the country's economic issues.
* Missouri faces an $800 million revenue shortfall due to federal funding ending and sluggish economic growth.
* The US national debt has surpassed $13.3 trillion, with each taxpayer responsible for over $120,000 in debt.
* Senator Sam Slom delivered opening day remarks emphasizing individual risk and accomplishment, opposing bad programs and advocating for transparency in government.

These points highlight various budget reduction plans, criticisms of politicians' actions, and economic issues affecting different states and the country as a whole.","New York is facing a financial crisis marked by anemic tax collections and the prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street. Governor George E. Pataki proposed a budget plan in January that cut state aid to schools and sharply curbed healthcare spending, but was vetoed by the legislature. The legislature then overrode Pataki's vetoes, reviving a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and localities.

Pataki is considering running for re-election or possibly presidential candidacy, despite his advisors saying he has not told anyone he will run. The governor's intentions are preoccupying Albany, where lobbyists with ties to the administration are fretting about a future without Pataki.

A budget deal was reached between Governor Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders, which includes cuts to the court system, including hundreds of layoffs. The state is expected to rely on unpalatable alternatives, such as deep spending cuts and tax increases, to address its fiscal predicament.

New York's budget gap is expected to grow, with some options being considered, including extending a surcharge on taxable earnings or borrowing against projected revenues from casinos planned for the Catskills. The state faced an even larger budget gap two years ago but was able to close it by borrowing more than $4 billion against future tobacco revenues.

Governor Pataki proposed stricter limits on campaign contributions, including lower contribution limits, banning soft money in state races, and tougher enforcement of campaign finance laws.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - officials want federal bailout to find its way to localities
the infusion of federal aid could not have come at a more opportune time for new york. it is facing a financial crisis marked by anemic tax collections and the prolonged sluggishness on wall street. george e. pataki, the three-term republican governor, proposed a budget plan in january that cut state aid to schools and sharply curbed the money the government now spends on health care to help close an $11.5 billion deficit. but the state's two top legislative leaders, afraid that those cuts on core state services would foist huge property tax increases onto localities, drafted their own budget over the objections of the governor. true to his word, mr. pataki then vetoed the legislature's $92.8 billion budget. but for the first time in two decades, the legislature then overrode mr. pataki's vetoes of its spending plan. in doing so, the lawmakers revived a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes and localities. fiscal purists said that both the legislature's and the governor's budget plans were flawed, mainly because each relied on $4.2 billion in borrowing to pay for day-to-day operating costs, which would lead to deficits in later years. under the plan announced today, new york will receive $1.4 billion from the $10 billion set aside to help states and localities cover additional medicaid costs. the $1.4 billion

Article 2 - pataki future: growing signs he won't run
""i know for a fact the governor has not told anyone he is not running,"" said one longtime adviser to mr. pataki, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the situation. ""i think he has told people he is inclined not to, but he leaves himself the door open."" one of mr. pataki's political advisers and former communications directors, michael mckeon, said he thinks anything is possible. ""at the end of the day, he's very likely to run for re-election,"" mr. mckeon said on monday. ""i think he's still very much up in the air, and it could go either way, but he loves the job, it gets his juices flowing, and the idea of a hard-fought, competitive race, i think, is going to be too much for him to pass up."" the question of mr. pataki's intentions is preoccupying albany, where he has held power for more than a decade. lobbyists with ties to the administration are fretting about a future in a post-pataki world, the republican party is despairing of finding a viable candidate should he not run, and some members of the republican-led state senate are pondering a future in which they, instead of the democratic-led assembly, would be the ones playing the role of the opposition. there are signs that the governor is continuing to flirt with the idea of running for president. he courted i

Article 3 - albany leaders near deal on a budget
“i’m very confident that what we have here is an intellectual meeting of the minds, across party lines, across regions, that makes tough decisions, and tough decisions that are in line with what i proposed as a fundamental shift in our budgeting and our set of priorities,” the governor said at a news conference announcing the deal shortly before 9 p.m. “i think we have come very far in the context of what is clearly going to be a multiyear effort to turn the ship of state,” he added. “we are trying to unwind years of, layers of, sometimes poor decision-making, methods of decision-making that we have to think about and undo. and nobody should expect that this will occur in the course of one budget cycle.” neither joseph l. bruno, the republican senate majority leader, nor the assembly speaker, sheldon silver, appeared at the news conference with the governor. but all three released a joint statement that outlined the terms of the deal. “it’s the stuff we’ve argued for,” said john mcardle, a spokesman for senate republicans, referring to the agreements outlined in the statement. “i would say we are cautiously optimistic that we can achieve an on-time budget that meets the framework that was announced.” the agreements came five days before the state budget is due. for the past two years, lawmakers have passed budgets by the deadline, after two decades of failing to meet it. different sides were claiming victory tuesday night, though many key

Article 4 - cuomo attacks mccall, who attacks pataki, who . . .
''george pataki is unwilling to step up and provide the leadership and make the tough decisions about what the future's going to be like,'' mr. mccall said. ''on issue after issue, the important issues that have to be decided, the governor's response to this is, 'mañana, let's make these decisions tomorrow.' '' mr. mccall pointed out that december is supposed to be a milestone for narrowing the number of plans for lower manhattan, and it is the deadline for a report commissioned by the governor on whether to close the indian point nuclear plant. in addition, mr. mccall said, the metropolitan transportation authority board, which the governor controls, will not decide on a possible fare increase until at least december. he also said mr. pataki had dragged his feet on facing the state's fiscal problems, changing the rockefeller-era drug laws and enacting campaign-finance reform. at a news conference later, mr. pataki's face took on a wounded look when he heard of mr. mccall's remarks. but he stuck to the script he has used to distance himself throughout the primary: they are politicians. i am the governor. ''that's just politics as usual,'' he said. ''i will continue to work hard every day to bring the people of new york together, to move us forward together, to make the important decisions when they should be made, not for anyone's political agenda.'' mr. mccall, even when

Article 5 - chief judge says deal will require hundreds of layoffs in court system
judge lippman was one of many officials around the state, in government and elsewhere, who scrambled to take stock of the state’s budget deal, which mr. cuomo announced in a triumphant ceremony at the capitol on sunday that was filled with grinning faces but was sparse on details. the cuts to the court system, which has about 15,500 employees, came two months after mr. cuomo chastised the judicial branch for not agreeing to a 10 percent reduction in spending that he imposed on state agencies. (mr. cuomo also cut his own budget 10 percent, as did the state comptroller and the attorney general.) photo a month ago, judge lippman submitted a revised budget that would cut $100 million in spending, or about 4 percent, from the $2.7 billion he had requested, an amount roughly unchanged from the past year’s budget. the $170 million cut will equal about 6 percent. mr. cuomo and the legislative leaders settled on the larger figure so that the court system would shoulder “a more proportionate share of the state’s reductions,” josh vlasto, a spokesman for the governor, said. judge lippman said he did not know whether the additional cut would force the closing of any courthouses. he also was not sure whether he would still be able to increase state financing for lawyers to represent the poor in cases dealing with foreclosures, child support and other civil matters. at

Article 6 - a city’s wrenching budget choices
wilmington, n.c., is not camden, n.j., which laid off half its police force this year. it is not detroit , which is closing half of its public schools. but like local governments across the country, the city of wilmington has been demonstrably diminished by five years of unyielding economic despair. that a place like wilmington, until recently a real estate boom town, would defer a purchase as essential as a fire truck for even one year, much less five, speaks to the withering toll. in repeated visits over six months, wilmington revealed itself to be typical of hundreds of american cities where the relentless drip-drip-drip of yearly contractions has gradually arrested civic momentum. as they wrangled over the 2012 budget, the city’s recession-weary mayor, bill saffo, and his fellow council members faced a menu of increasingly distasteful options. for mr. saffo, 50, a second-generation developer whose family had prospered with the area’s growth, the notion of presiding over a shrinking city was hard to stomach. already a light sleeper, he was down to about four hours a night as a series of haunting tradeoffs — and a looming july 1 budget deadline — confronted him in the dark. padding around his house in a pittsburgh steelers t-shirt, while his wife, renee, still slept, mr. saffo would flit from worry to worry. with the

Article 7 - a $6 billion hole in albany's pocket is expected to grow
but so troublesome is the state's fiscal predicament that many budget watchdogs and lawmakers say the state may be forced to rely on some unpalatable alternatives, like a combination of deep spending cuts on core services and tax increases. one likely tool would be extending a surcharge on taxable earnings of more than $100,000 for single people or more than $150,000 for married couples. that surcharge, which raised the state tax rate to 7.5 percent from 6.85 percent, was to expire at the end of next year. extending the surcharge, and extending the sales tax on clothing items costing less than $110, could yield a combined $1 billion next year and $2 billion the following year, said colleen woodell, the managing director in public finance at standard & poor's rating agency. she said she fully expected the state to go that route. another option being mentioned by lawmakers and others is borrowing against projected revenues from casinos planned for the catskills, although pataki administration officials say that is not being considered at this time. the state faced an even larger budget gap of $11.5 billion two years ago, but then it was coming off the economic downturn from the sept. 11 attacks and was able to close much of the gap by borrowing more than $4 billion against its share of future tobacco revenues, a remedy unavailable this time around. fiscal analysts say that while the projected budget deficit is not as bad as it was in 

Article 8 - pataki seeks stricter limits on campaign contributions
albany, may 26 - with just a month left in the legislative session, gov. george e. pataki proposed campaign finance legislation thursday that would lower contribution limits, ban soft money in state races and toughen enforcement of campaign finance laws. the governor has made the proposals in the past, but this year he divided them into two separate bills, an approach that officials and lobbyists said could ease negotiations with the state legislature by offering more room for compromise. the democratic-controlled assembly passed its own bill in january calling for public financing of state elections, which governor pataki, a republican, does not support. but the assembly bill does have items in common with the governor's proposal, including calls to ban soft money, set lower contribution limits and close loopholes that allow corporations to exceed contribution limits by donating through subsidiaries. the republican-led state senate has yet to pass campaign finance legislation this year. civic groups have long complained that new york's campaign finance laws are far too lax, especially when compared with the much stronger laws in new york city and at the federal level. they say contribution limits are high, the amount of information disclosed is limited, and there are many loopholes to avoid contribution limits. advertisement continue reading the main story while corporations are banned from giving contributions of more than $5,000 to individual candidates, the new york times reported in february that many were able to circumvent the limit by making unlimited soft money donations to the so-called housekeeping accounts

Content: the democrat-led assembly and the republican-led senate overcame partisan differences to pass the stripped-down plan in a last-ditch effort to compel the governor to talk about adding some spending to his budget. for months, mr. pataki has said the state cannot afford to spend more than the $83.6 billion he proposed in january because of the shaky national economy. michael mckeon, the governor's chief spokesman, said, ''the governor's going to make it clear to the people of this state in every corner of this state that he stands against the albany insiders who want to spend more than the people can afford.'' the comptroller, h. carl mccall, a democrat who is planning to run for governor next year, said the $79.6 billion spending plan the legislature passed was ''not a good budget'' but laid the blame squarely at mr. pataki's feet. he said the governor had avoided albany and failed to broker a deal with lawmakers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the budget essentially holds spending at last year's levels or lower in most state programs, except for a $382 million increase in school aid. it cuts about $4 billion from the governor's proposed budget, including several large blocks of money used for economic development and welfare programs. legislative leaders are betting it will inflict so much pain on local governments that political pressure will mount on the governor to negotiate a supplemental budget that will include some of the lawmakers' priorities. there is no question that the budget will make it difficult for mr. pataki to govern. dozens of social service programs, from medicaid payments to day care for the working poor, are facing a $1.5 billion shortfall this year unless an ancillary budget is passed, the governor's budget office said. but the legislature also eliminated a number of large funds dear to mr. pataki over which it has little control. among them is a $150 million fund for conserving wilderness, a $1.5 billion fund of unspent federal welfare money that can be used for social programs and more than $300 million in economic development grants. mr. pataki began the day with a fishing exhibition in syracuse and then held news conferences in rochester and buffalo before returning to albany late in the day to speak to reporters. all day, he hammered away at the legislature for passing what he said was a budget full of holes that would cause many programs to run out of money. he also chastised lawmakers for taking a vacation before finishing the job. lawmakers, however, countered that it was the governor who had

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
New York is facing a financial crisis marked by anemic tax collections and the prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street. Governor George E. Pataki proposed a budget plan in January that cut state aid to schools and sharply curbed healthcare spending, but was vetoed by the legislature. The legislature then overrode Pataki's vetoes, reviving a budget that increases state taxes to restore billions of dollars in spending on schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and localities.

Pataki is considering running for re-election or possibly presidential candidacy, despite his advisors saying he has not told anyone he will run. The governor's intentions are preoccupying Albany, where lobbyists with ties to the administration are fretting about a future without Pataki.

A budget deal was reached between Governor Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders, which includes cuts to the court system, including hundreds of layoffs. The state is expected to rely on unpalatable alternatives, such as deep spending cuts and tax increases, to address its fiscal predicament.

New York's budget gap is expected to grow, with some options being considered, including extending a surcharge on taxable earnings or borrowing against projected revenues from casinos planned for the Catskills. The state faced an even larger budget gap two years ago but was able to close it by borrowing more than $4 billion against future tobacco revenues.

Governor Pataki proposed stricter limits on campaign contributions, including lower contribution limits, banning soft money in state races, and tougher enforcement of campaign

Article 3 - childs leaves hard road behind him
childs thought long about this after the game was over, this 83-82 thriller won by the irrepressible knicks and their backup point guard. he scored 13 straight knicks points, including 10 to begin the fourth quarter, keeping them in a game they were about to throw away. but when the offensive options dwindled to one, the most confident role player in america morphed into the knicks' go-to guy, maneuvering his 6-foot-2-inch frame past alonzo mourning and the miami front line, scoring on driving layups and drawing fouls, knocking down important jump shots. fitting, no, that childs helped end the madness? for all the nothing-to-lose loyalists who gave up their bodies for miami coach pat riley the past two weeks -- bowen, carter, dan majerle and clarence weatherspoon -- the knicks finally countered with one of their own. knicks-heat has never been about ego, multimillionaires or petulant franchise players. it is about hard-core ball, gym rats and hoop junkies, trading shots like two youngsters in a pillow fight who can't seem to get the other one to go groggy and drop.

somewhere in between lie the reasons for a 25-39 record. and what would be a cry for celebration in chicago still remains an indictment in new york. but the knicks are showing signs of the team they might have been. ''if we don't get the playoff spot, we still want to finish playing as if we're playing for a playoff spot,'' allan houston said, moments after making all five of his 3-point attempts and finishing with a game-high 28 points. jackson outplayed the younger and quicker andre miller, cleveland's floor leader. if miller came in with a right hip pointer, he left with a severely bruised ego. aside from being unable to thwart jackson, miller was in foul trouble all evening and finished only 3 of 10 from the field with 10 points and 11 assists. he let his frustration get the best of him, picking up a technical in the final minutes. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. with 1 minute 30 seconds left, cleveland coach john lucas was ejected by referee tim donaghy after receiving

Article 6 - knicks have no answer for carter
the knicks' problems extended beyond carter. the raptors led by 28-11 after the first quarter, and carter had only 2 points. but his pendulum moves seemed to put the knicks in a teamwide trance. it was evident in their slow-reacting defense, chaotic offense and sloppy ball-handling (19 turnovers). it was clear when allan houston (10 points) couldn't fight through a screen to stop dell curry's first-quarter flurry, and patrick ewing (16 points) couldn't slog through the paint quickly enough to catch up with antonio davis (17 points). it was enough to leave coach jeff van gundy in the kind of self-flogging state that has become familiar when his team begins flirting with danger. ''i haven't made it crystal clear what we need to do against these guys,'' said van gundy, whose team dropped the season series, 3-1, to the raptors and allowed carter to average 33 points a game. ''carter knows that we know we don't want to play him. we didn't want to compete against him. i'm frustrated with myself. i haven't come up with the right plan.''. van gundy tried larry johnson, then sprewell, then marcus camby, and not one of them could get close enough to put his body on carter.

they did it with crawford’s usual scoring burst, 18 points from fred jones, a tireless effort from david lee (17 points, 9 rebounds) and a surprising, throwback performance from malik rose, who contributed 7 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists — all in the final 15 minutes 29 seconds of the game. rose, the only knicks player with a championship ring, had become a forgotten man in thomas’s rotation, but his veteran savvy came through at the right time. asked if it was nice to feel needed, rose grinned. “nice to have a microphone in front of me,” he said. milwaukee (19-32) nearly blew the game open in the third quarter, using a 23-4 run to take an 81-64 lead. then crawford went into attack mode, sparking a 15-0 run from the third to fourth quarters to get the knicks back in the game. crawford’s 15-footer early in the fourth cut the deficit to a point, 86-85, but he missed a free throw that would have tied the score. photo the bucks pushed the lead to 7 points on a 3-pointer by redd with 6:14 to play, but the knicks again charged back, with crawford’s off-balance 3-pointer tying the score, 93-93. then rose went to work. he tipped in his own miss to give the

Article 8 - stoudemire sits, but a rookie and a veteran stand tall
landry fields had a breakout game with 21 points. and toney douglas (17 points) settled into his playmaker role, dishing out 8 assists and connecting repeatedly with chandler. the knicks thus salvaged a three-game trip that started with losses to golden state and to the los angeles lakers. “i thought toney played like he did last year,” coach mike d’antoni said, praising the young backcourt of douglas and fields. “they will be products of, if the ball moves, they’ll play better.” photo for the first time in three games, the ball did move, to the tune of 26 assists, with anthony contributing five and bill walker six. it helped, too, that the knicks played a sacramento team that seems to lack an identity at either end of the court. marcus thornton led the kings with 14 points. tyreke evans, the former rookie of the year, had only 13 points. jimmer fredette, the rookie sensation who has energized kings fans, had only 7 points, going 2 for 10 from the field. the best rookie on the floor, though, was harrellson, who was taken with the 45th pick last june — 35 picks after fredette. he made his first attempt, a 3-pointer, then hit three more from the arc, finishing 5 for 11 from the field. “it

Article 1 - response to quentin d. atkinson
response to quentin d. atkinson (before it's news) we would like to thank quentin d. atkinson for taking the time to respond to our critique of the science article by bouckaert et al., of which he is one of the authors. while he appears to restate their team’s position rather than address specific criticisms that we had voiced, we feel that we should address those issues that atkinson brings up in defense of their methodology. according to atkinson, “the inferences based on linguistic palaeontology [i.e. the approach we advocate in our critique] have thus far failed to satisfy … three requirements”. first, atkinson correctly points out that “in order to reconstruct a term to proto-indo-european, the common ancestor of all indo-european languages, it must be present in those languages that are first to branch off from the base of the tree. it is not enough to point to similar terms in some sub-groups of the family. thus, in the case of indo-european, if a word is not present in the anatolian languages at the base of the tree, there is no reason to think it was present in proto-indo-european”. this applies in particular to the words denoting vehicular meanings such as the reconstructed proto-indo-european (pie) *kwekwlos ‘wheel’, *rot-eh another term for ‘wheel’, *aks ‘axle’, *hihs- ‘thill’

Article 3 - altaic and related languages?
altaic and related languages? (before it's news) today’s language-family maps take up the controversial issue of altaic. several decades ago, many linguists grouped the altaic languages with the uralic languages, but that thesis is no longer tenable. now many linguists are expressing doubt about the altaic family itself. languages placed within this group have a number of common features, but such features seem to many experts to result from borrowing. the farther back in history one goes, the less similar the main branches of the altaic family appear. to the extent that this is true, altaic cannot be regarded as a legitimate language family. i have therefore included a conventional map of altaic, based closely on the wikipedia language-family map found here. but i have also posted maps of the three main branches of altaic (turkic, mongolic, and tungusic), which may well be first-order language families themselves. note again that the mapping is approximate at best, and refers to the situation pertaining in the mid-twentieth century rather than that of today. i have again closely followed the wikipedia original map, although i did add a small turkic area in northeastern bulgaria. i wanted to add one as well in northern cyprus, but the area is too small to be indicated given the tools that i am using. a few scholars have suggested that japanese and korean also fall into the altaic category, although that view is difficult to support. others

Article 4 - the consistently incorrect mapping of language differentiation in bouckaert et al.
the consistently incorrect mapping of language differentiation in bouckaert et al. (before it's news) as mentioned in previous geocurrents posts, the animated map that accompanies the science article of bouckaert et al. depicts their model in action, showing the expansion and differentiation of the indo-european languages in time and space. earlier posts criticized the map’s contour shadings, which indicate high probabilities of ie languages being spoken in given areas at given times. today’s post takes on a related issue, that of the branching lines that spread across the map as the presentation unfolds, indicating both linguistic relationship and the general directions of language-group expansion. here we can clearly see that the model generates a nearly continuous stream of misleading information and outright error. analyzing the ramifying lines on animated map is challenging. nothing is labeled, colors are often hard to differentiate, and no key is provided. the companion website does promise a “legend for movie s1,” but provides only a brief caption: “movie showing the expansion of the indo-european languages through time. contours on the map represent the 95% highest posterior density distribution of the range of indo-european.” one must thus infer what the lines represent based on the supplementary text and on the manner in which different segments lengthen and divide in particular places as time proceeds. each line represents a branch of the indo-european language family. those that appear early in the animation indicate the deepest divisions, while those that emerge later represent the shallower

Article 1 - language arrogance
to the editor: “languages die, but not their last words” (news article, sept. 19) seems to jump uncritically on the “endangered languages” bandwagon. opening with an alarmist prediction about the rate of global language disappearance, it closes by citing a misleading parallel made by linguistic researchers between languages and biological species. scholars who promote these arguments often have a narrow view of language change, overlooking the emergence of new languages and the dramatic changes that habitually occur within existing languages. i cringe at the thought of western scientists and activists descending upon indigenous (indigent) populations around the world to preserve botanical knowledge for the sake of “science” (a code word for western pharmacology) and to impose their view of linguistic and cultural diversity in an effort to persuade the speakers of disappearing languages to reverse their choices about which language best serves their socioeconomic needs. josef horacek athens, ga., sept. 19, 2007

''i like things with strong visual appeal,'' he said, ''so i attempted to take the best indian art away from the ethnographic world in order to show it as art.'' he specializes in three-dimensional rather than two-dimensional works. ''masks and objects used in rituals and day-to-day life are like sculpture,'' he said, adding that he believes that is why so many of his clients are collectors of modern art. ''major collectors of 20th-century art find it mixes well with their collections.'' he has also sold indian art to museums, including the cleveland museum of art and the museum of fine arts in boston. in treating indian artifacts as art, mr. ellis said, he is following a tradition begun by picasso and other early 20th-century artists. ''eskimo art had a strong influence on the surrealists,'' he said. later on, mr. ellis said, andre breton, the poet and art critic who was a founder of surrealism, came to new york and bought indian artifacts. his collection is now at the louvre. the material gained legitimacy as an art form when the dealer eugene v. thaw, a collector of old masters and a major museum benefactor, moved to santa fe, n.m., in the late 1980's and began acquiring indian artifacts. he is giving his collection to the new york state historical society association in cooperstown, n.y. it is already on display there at the fenimore

google’s ai translation tool seems to have invented its own secret internal language techcrunch 32 mins ago devin coldewey © getty images the multi dimensional installation explores the movement of data, ai and the possibilities of collaboration between humans and machines, in england, october 20, 2016. all right, don’t panic, but computers have created their own secret language and are probably talking about us right now . well, that’s kind of an oversimplification, and the last part is just plain untrue. but there is a fascinating and existentially challenging development that google’s ai researchers recently happened across. you may remember that back in september, google announced that its neural machine translation system had gone live . it uses deep learning to produce better, more natural translations between languages. cool! following on this success, gnmt’s creators were curious about something. if you teach the translation system to translate english to korean and vice versa, and also english to japanese and vice versa… could it translate korean to japanese, without resorting to english as a bridge between them? they made this helpful gif to illustrate the idea of what they call “zero-shot translation” (it’s the orange one): as it turns out — yes! it produces “reasonable” translations between two languages that it has not explicitly linked in any way. remember, no english allowed. but this raised a second question. if the computer is able to make connections between concepts and words that have not

Article 5 - in simple pronouns, clues to shifting latino identity
''when you think that the united states is the fifth largest spanish-speaking nation in the world and new york has more spanish speakers than 13 latin american capitals, you begin to appreciate the dimensions of the linguistic and cultural hybridity that's taking place.'' oddly enough, what the researchers are studying is a linguistic feature that may look insignificant at first glance: the use or nonuse of subject pronouns. but it is one of those tiny details in science, like the finch's beak in the study of evolution, that occasionally illuminate something profound. the use of subject pronouns in spanish has long been of interest to linguists. (there is an entire book on so-called subject expression among spanish speakers in madrid.) in english, the subject of a sentence is always expressed; in spanish it can be, and often is, left out. for example, where an english speaker would say ''we sing,'' a spanish speaker could say either ''nosotros cantamos'' or simply ''cantamos.'' linguists say spanish speakers from the caribbean tend to use a lot of pronouns; people from central and south american countries use them less. ''what makes new york city interesting, and why we grabbed this issue, is that new york contains people from areas that differ with respect to this feature,'' said ricardo otheguy, a professor of linguistics at the graduate center of the city university of new york and a researcher on the project. ''it's interesting to compare puerto ricans

Article 6 - the retreat of the tongue of the czars
the kremlin has tried to halt the decline by setting up foundations to promote the study of russian abroad and by castigating neighbors who shove the language from public life. in some nations, a backlash against russian has stirred its own backlash in the language’s defense. still, the challenge is considerable. at stake is more than just words on a page. language imparts power and influence, binding the colonized to the colonizers and, for better or worse, altering how native populations interact with the world. long after they gave up their territories, britain and france and spain have retained a certain authority in far-flung outposts because of the languages that they seeded. czars and soviet leaders spread russian in the lands that they conquered, using it as a kind of glue to unite disparate nationalities, a so-called second mother tongue, and connect them to their rulers. that legacy endures today, as exemplified by the close relationship between russia and germany, which stems in part from chancellor angela merkel’s ability to speak russian. she learned it growing up in communist east germany. but with the language in retreat, there are unlikely to be many future angela merkels. for the kremlin, could there be a more bitter reminder of how history has turned than the sight of young estonians or georgians or uzbeks (not to mention czechs or hungarians) flocking to classes in english instead of russian? “the

Article 7 - what we all spoke when the world was young
but one scholar in particular, dr. joseph h. greenberg of stanford university, has defied this ardent pessimism. in the course of a long career, he has classified most of the world's languages into just a handful of major groups. though it remains unclear how these superfamilies may be related to one another, he has identified words and concepts that seem common to them all and could be echoes of a mother tongue. and this month, at the age of 84, dr. greenberg is publishing the first of two volumes on eurasiatic, his proposed superfamily that includes a swath of languages spoken from portugal to japan. like the biologist e. o. wilson, dr. greenberg is that rare breed of academic, a synthesizer who derives patterns from the work of many specialists, an exercise the specialists do not always welcome. but though biologists came to acknowledge the pioneering value of dr. wilson's work, linguists have reached no such consensus on that of dr. greenberg. will he one day be recognized as having done for language what linnaeus did for biology, as his stanford colleague and associate dr. merritt ruhlen believes, or is his work more fit, as one critic has urged, to be ''shouted down''? dr. greenberg is by no means an outcast from his profession. he is one of the very few linguists who are members of the national academy of sciences,

Title: mismodeling indo-european origin and expansion: bouckaert, atkinson, wade and the assault on historical linguistics
Content: mismodeling indo-european origin and expansion: bouckaert, atkinson, wade and the assault on historical linguistics (before it's news) dear readers, as geocurrents passed through its august slowdown, plans were made for a series on the summer olympics. thanks to the efforts of chris kremer, we have gathered statistics—and made maps—relating olympic medal count by country to population and gdp, both overall and in regard to specific categories of competition. the series, however, has been put on hold by the recent publication of two heralded articles on the history and geography of the indo-european language family. on august 24, a short piece in science—“mapping the origins and expansion of the indo-european language family”—made extravagant claims, purporting to overturn the most influential historical-linguistic account of the world’s most widespread language family. on the same day, nicholas wade, noted new york times science reporter, wrote a half-page spread in the news section of the times on the science report, entitled “family tree of languages has roots in anatolia, biologists say.” over the next few days, the story was picked up—and often twisted in the process—by assorted journalists. within a few days, headlines appeared as preposterous as “english language originated in turkey.” as wade’s title indicates, the science article, written by remco bouckaert and eight others (most notably quentin d. atkinson), seeks to overturn the thesis that the indo-european (i-e) family originated north of the black and caspian seas. it instead locates the i-e heartland in what is now turkey, supporting the “anatolian” thesis advanced a generation ago by archeologist colin renfrew. the science team bases its claims on mathematical grounds, using techniques derived from evolutionary biology and epidemiology to draw linguistic family trees and model the geographical spread of language groups. according to wade, the authors claim that their study does nothing less than “solve” a “long-standing problem in archaeology: the origin of the indo-european family of languages.” (strictly speaking, however, the problem is not an archaeological one, as excavations by themselves tell us nothing about the languages of non-literate peoples; it is rather a linguistic problem with major bearing on prehistory more generally.) as geocurrents is deeply interested in the intersection of language, geography, and history, the two articles immediately grabbed our attention. our initial response was one of profound skepticism, as it hardly seemed likely that a single mathematical study could “solve” one of the most carefully examined conundrums of the distant human past. recent work in both linguistics and archeology, moreover, has tended against the anatolian hypothesis, placing indo-european origins in the steppe and parkland zone of what is now ukraine,

The Indo-European language family is being reevaluated, with some linguists questioning its legitimacy due to similarities between languages that may be attributed to borrowing rather than common ancestry.

Maps are used to illustrate the distribution of information and languages across different regions. For example, a map shows the percentage of ethnic Tatars in Russia, highlighting the complex history of the region.

The geography of words for certain concepts, such as ""book"" or ""tea"", reveals patterns of language spread and contact. 

Language families like Altaic are being reexamined due to concerns about their internal consistency and relationships with other language groups.

A study on language differentiation is criticized for its methodology, including the use of animated maps that can be misleading and lack clear labels.

The Tatar region in Russia is described as a ""hostage"" of strained relations between Russia and Turkey.

Language contact and cultural exchange are evident in the spread of words across languages, with certain concepts like ""book"" being borrowed along with their meanings.

gameloft responds to android army cries regarding user unfriendly android drm policy. % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by george heymann techeadlines@gmail.com a few weeks ago, i shared a post “gamelofts very user unfriendly android game policy.” in the post, i detailed gameloft policy regarding software downloaded from its web store. “if you buy a game, you can re-download it to the same phone with the same phone number within 3 years of your purchase. if the phone model or number was changed by the customer’s own initiative, gameloft has the right to refuse re-sending the game.” i contacted several other android sites to help me spread the word regarding this policy. thanks again android police, android guys, android spin, and all about android (podcast episode 6). it now appears that gameloft has heard us and listened to customer concerns. gameloft is reportedly allowing customers to re-download games purchased through its web store. you will be able to do by signing into your gameloft account, bypassing the need to go through a customer service representative. i couldn’t be happier about gameloft’s apparent about-face. i’ve reached out to gameloft for an official response and will update this post with the reply. thanks to everyone who contacted gameloft. it proves what is possible when the android community is unified behind

rim bringing blackberry messenger to android and ios. (before it's news) the blackberry os may not be looked as favorably upon in the age of android, ios, and webos, but truth be told there are still several good things going for it. for one, the email while simple, is extremely easy to set up, operates reliably, and is customizable on a much larger scale for enterprises. but perhaps the most important aspect of the blackberry os moving forward is blackberry messenger. this once ignored im “app” has blossomed more into a platform as features are added. the basic concept of blackberry messenger is so popular in fact that ios and android apps such as kik have sprouted up emulating the same experience across different platforms (and until recently kik was also a blackberry experience too). but it appears rim is ready to take the cross-platform chatting into their own hands and compete directly with kik and friends with a new stripped down, cross-platform version of blackberry messenger. according to bgr’s sources, android is a for sure thing. ios is planned, though later on down the road — obvious issues concerning app store policies, etc. as for timing, there isn’t anything more specific other than “sometime this year”. either way, we’re pretty excited as bbm is one of the last great things rim has going for them with the bb os. one other thing that will be worth watching is just how rim handles other cross-platform

android coming to new volvo’s % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) we have spoken several times on our blog about how certain car manufacturers like volvo, mazda & bmw are taking steps to integrate more intelligent systems within vehicles that connect to our phones and mobile devices. however volvo have perhaps taken the boldest next step that will appeal to all you technology lovers. they have teamed up with neonode to launch a new in-car entertainment and information system which is powered by android. it has been heavily customised to integrate with the vehicle and make it more attractive for users but there is a lot on offer. the 7” touch screen display allows you to complete anything from street level navigation, to web browsing to streaming audio through services like spotify to creating a wireless hotspot and even connecting usb dongles to it. whilst it may not give you everything that we techies would want from it it certainly shows developments are being made and if this came in my car then i would be pretty pleased. see what the new system has to offer in the following promo video: now other manufacturers, can you do the same please?! source: slashgear via: android authority clove technology’s blog – for the latest news, reviews and advice on smartphones, tablets and accessories. source:

Article 8 - cross platform: the future of mobile app development
cross platform: the future of mobile app development headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the surging demand for new and improved smartphones and tablets is increasingly leading to ever pervasive demand for mobile apps. so what do you do in this volatile market situation? do you make your app for a single platform or double your efforts to build it repeatedly for different platforms like ios or android? or would you simply prefer the cross platform technology that is being touted as the future of app development for mobile app developers? offering mobile apps with an extra edge of cross platform is the trend for developers at the moment. an app that is workable on all operating platforms has the scales tipped in its favor. various cross platform mobile app development strategies are being developed which will be described as the future of mobile apps. how will you prepare yourself for this trending piece of innovation? the answer to this question lies in your ability as a developer to adapt and respond to impending change. let us first understand what cross platform is. it refers to a strategy that works in development of apps for different platforms. when a mobile app is developed for cross platform compatibility, it is able to offer identical or similar functional outputs in several operating platforms as well as different devices. for instance, an app that works on operating systems like android, ios, linux, mac etc. will be called a cross platform app. nowadays, more and more cross platform developers are working toward developing apps that work on multiple platforms at the same time

Article 1 - blackberry under siege in europe
“we’ve seen quite a huge growth of android in the enterprise over the last 18 months,” said nick mcquire, research director of enterprise mobility strategies at the international data corporation. “we see it as being neck and neck with apple to be a top mobile enterprise platform in europe.” photo rim’s answer to the increasing popularity of android handsets and the iphone is a new version of the blackberry software, called blackberry 10. but phones based on the new software system have been delayed several times and are now not expected until late 2012. thorsten heins, the company’s new chief executive, said the new software would address the “consumerization of i.t.,” referring to the growing trend of businesses letting their employees choose which devices they bring to work. mr. heins believes that rim’s advantage in the business market remains the company’s focus on security. he said that rim regularly speaks to chief information officers, who say they do not like that android devices and iphones have become prominent in the work place. “they are in a pickle. their pickle is security,” mr. heins said in an interview. “when the first big security flaw even happens in one of the large enterprises, you will see this turn around. wait for the day this happens.” but waiting is not something people in businesses are doing. i.d.c. recently surveyed business managers and information technology managers at 728 businesses across seven western european countries and found that android was the

google play newsstand web more google play newsstand finally has a web interface . the app has previously only been available on android and ios app. it’s one of the few play-branded google services to get its own dedicated web app — the other is music. google play books, movies & tv, and games are only accessible via the google play store. oddly, while you can access the dedicated google play music site through the play store, there is no way to access the newsstand website — you can only manage your feed . more: google earth vr makes the entire planet available in virtual reality the website’s design mimics the recent visual overhaul on the mobile counterpart in design. you will find the weather forecast at the top along with a search bar and a middle column below shows the day’s news. to access different categories and publications, like tech or the new york times, you can click the library icon in the sidebar or pull out the hamburger menu. the read later tab allows you to access articles you tag on your mobile device and you can also access any magazine content you have subscribed to via the magazines tab. interestingly, web articles open either as a new tab with the original source or as a pop-up on the newsstand site. the pop-up variants load much faster and you do not need to hit the back button to reload the newsstand site to resume scrolling. the service now has better multimedia controls and it also uses machine learning to “find and recommend the most timely,

Article 3 - for digital artists, apps provide new palette
but the advent of mobile devices with touch screens and tilt sensors changed all that. beginning last january, mr. snibbe dusted off some of his old code and got to work. he has since released three mobile applications — bubble harp, antograph and gravilux — and has become one of the first artists to make it big in the itunes app store. all told, his three apps have been downloaded over 400,000 times. the majority of those downloads, though, came when he released gravilux without charge; eventually, he set the price at 99 cents per download for the iphone version of gravilux and antograph, with bubble harp and the ipad gravilux retailing for $1.99. he would not say how much he had made, save to allow that he covered the “significant” start-up costs. his gravilux application — an elegant, black and white field of dots that follows the user’s finger around the screen — was released in may. in 24 hours it soared to the top of the app charts. apple selected gravilux to be a featured app, a coveted slot. mr. snibbe’s apps resemble interactive screen savers, with mesmerizing patterns that respond to touch. he has more on the way this fall and winter. while artist-made apps make up only a sliver of the 225,000 apps in the itunes store, the field is growing, with some well

Article 4 - apple launches beta 2 of ios 10.2, featuring new tv app and music app ui tweaks
the second beta of ios 10.2 has been pushed to developers, bringing a number of changes to the operating system, which will ultimately be pushed to consumers. perhaps the biggest change to ios is the fact that it now has the tv app that was shown off during apple’s october 27 event. the app allows users to view content from a range of other streaming accounts, although netflix will not be among the list of providers at launch, according to reports from recode . more: facebook gradually moving into tv advertising with apple tv and roku tv ads apart from the tv app, the new ios 10.2 beta comes with a few design tweaks in apple music, and some new sos features. when it comes to the sos features, users will now be able to press the power button five times to automatically dial an emergency number. the feature works in australia, belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, hong kong, india, italy, japan, russia, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states. you can manage the settings for the new sos feature by heading to the settings app and scrolling to the general section. the music app has also gotten a few design tweaks to make using it a little easier. for example, the shuffle and repeat buttons have both been made a little more prominent, and you can simply swipe up to access those larger buttons. apart from the tv app and the new music app, there are a few new

Article 6 - intel adopts an identity in software
for example, moblin fires up and reaches the internet in about seven seconds, then displays a novel type of start-up screen. people will find their appointments listed on one side of the screen, along with their favorite programs. but the bulk of the screen is taken up by cartoonish icons that show things like social networking updates from friends, photos and recently used documents. with animated icons and other quirky bits and pieces, moblin looks like a fresh take on the operating system. some companies hope it will give microsoft a strong challenge in the market for the small, cheap laptops commonly known as netbooks. a polished second version of the software, which is in trials, should start appearing on a variety of netbooks this summer. “we really view this as an opportunity and a game changer,” said ronald w. hovsepian, the chief executive of novell, which plans to offer a customized version on moblin to computer makers. novell views moblin as a way to extend its business selling software and services related to linux. while moblin fits netbooks well today, it was built with smartphones in mind. those smartphones explain why intel was willing to needle microsoft. photo intel has previously tried and failed to carve out a prominent stake in the market for chips used in smaller computing devices like phones. but the company says one of its newer chips, called atom, will solve this riddle and help it compete against the likes of texas instruments and qualcomm. the low-power,

“the market is changing,” said pal zarandy, a partner at rewheel, a helsinki firm that advises operators on their mobile data strategies. “the whole smartphone data transformation is a window that will last one or two more years. then that market will be saturated. the question is: can nokia and microsoft come up with relevant phones fast enough?” mr. elop, a 47-year-old canadian who ran microsoft’s office products division before joining nokia, said the alliance between the companies would deliver. the release of the n9 — which mr. elop said he pushed for relentlessly after he arrived — was a harbinger, he said, of a more competitive nokia. “it is an opportunity for us to test and to learn with the n9, but also to put a very clear statement in the market: nokia continues to innovate, does beautiful work,” mr. elop said in an interview last week at nokia’s glass-and-steel headquarters in espoo, a suburb west of helsinki. “innovation is alive and well at nokia.” photo during a 40-minute interview, mr. elop said nokia was on the cusp of a productive new phase that would re-establish the company’s credibility and increase its global smartphone share, which the market research firm gartner put at 27.4 percent in march, behind android, with 36 percent, and ahead of apple’s 16.8 percent. during the interview,

Article 8 - an android phone that says ‘google’
the back panel camera has an led flash, but the quality is only average and it can’t take hi-def videos. the low-resolution front-facing camera is intended for video calls or checking for spinach in your teeth. (the software for video calling doesn’t come with the phone, although you can download a couple of somewhat flaky apps for this purpose from the android app store online.) the 4-inch screen is bright, sharp and vivid. the case is all plastic, which makes it more of a scratch-and-fingerprint magnet than the glass-and-metal iphone. it’s sleek but fairly generic-looking; the only design eccentricity is a bulge on the lower back that, you could argue, helps you orient the phone when extracting it from your pocket. photo samsung also claims that the screen is slightly bowed inward — curved — to fit your face better. really? you’d need a microscope to measure it; the curve is virtually undetectable. if this minute degree of curvature fits your head, well, you must have a cranium the size of a hot-air balloon. the s lacks a couple of features of the original nexus, like dual microphones for sound cancellation (doesn’t matter — the s sounds great), the trackball that doubled as a message-indicator light, and the memory card slot. this time around, your storage is capped at 16 gigabytes — only 1 gig of which is available for storing standard downloaded apps. technically, the phone is sold “un

stifel nicolaus downgrades zions bancorporation to hold (before it's news) stifel nicolaus lowers its rating on zions bancorporation (nasdaq: zion) to hold as it revises estimates going forward on the company’s below-expectations earnings. stifel nicolaus says, “zions bancorp reported 4q11 eps of $$0.24, which was well below our estimate of $$0.37 and the consensus of $$0.33. …going forward we have significantly reduced our estimates to $$1.40 from $$1.59 for 2012 and $$1.85 from $$2.15 for 2013. the major driver is mostly due to a lower revenue estimate (continued nim pressures), and higher expense expectations, which is being offset somewhat by a lower loan loss provision expense. we were above the consensus estimate of $$1.61 for 2012 and $$2.00 for 2013 prior to the release of 4q11 results.” zion closed at $$18.55 a share on monday.

Article 3 - another bailout coming? – bank of england warns lloyds and rbs need billions more in capital
(before it's news) uk regulators have warned the royal bank of scotland and lloyds banking group that march of this year is the final deadline to cope with an impending financial ‘black hole’ caused by the undervaluing of bad debts. the warning came as regulators admitted that the government had overpaid when rescuing the banks in 2008. britain’s banks may now be forced to raise large amounts of capital in a short time to ensure they remain solvent, bank of england (boe) officials said. the exact amount of the shortfall was not specified, but bank officials confirmed it was substantial. the sum could reach £30 billion (over $$48 billion), according to brooks newmark, a tory member of the treasury select committee, the telegraph reported. boe financial policy committee member michael cohrs also said that he doesn’t believe that uk taxpayers will see any returns on the bank bailouts, let alone profits. earlier, the guardian reported that uk taxpayers would end 2012 with a £23-billion loss on their stakes in royal bank of scotland and lloyds banking group. boe governor mervyn king admitted on wednesday that the us has been more successful in bailing out its banks than the uk, adding that recapitalizing the banking system in 2008 was initially a british idea, which was then copied and improved by the us. as a result, us taxpayers saw returns equivalent to 15 percent after its bail

Article 5 - barclays makes £500m betting on food crisis
(before it's news) barclays has made as much as half a billion pounds in two years from speculating on food staples such as wheat and soya, prompting allegations that banks are profiting handsomely from the global food crisis. barclays is the uk bank with the greatest involvement in food commodity trading and is one of the three biggest global players, along with the us banking giants goldman sachs and morgan stanley, research from the world development movement points out. last week the trading giant glencore was attacked for describing the global food crisis and price rises as a “good” business opportunity. the extent of barclays’ involvement in food speculation comes to light as new figures from the world bank show that global food prices hit an all-time high in july, with poor harvests in the us and russia pushing up the average worldwide cost of staples by an unprecedented 10 per cent in a month. read more here: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/barclays-makes-500m-betting-on-food-crisis-8100011.html

Article 7 - global bankster mafia caught rigging markets to destroy middle class
global bankster mafia caught rigging markets to destroy middle class headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! christina sarich, staff waking times billion dollar lawsuits are nothing to gold-rigging banks like deutsche, but the proposition of spending time in jail might just have motivated the notorious criminal institution’s executives to rat on its peers. this is just the beginning of disclosure in the financial industry which the world has never before seen. deutsche was fined just over $2.5 billion barely a year ago for rigging interest rates, and now they are admitting in settled u.s. lawsuits this week that they manipulation gold and silver prices on international markets. part of the settlement involved the naming of co-conspirators in the manipulation of these markets. the scam is being called ‘the london gold fix’, and in addition to deutsche bank, canada’s bank of nova scotia, the u.k.’s barclays and hsbc, and france’s société générale are involved. more than likely hundreds of banks participated in illegally setting prices for gold and silver – but this isn’t really news to those familiar with the ministrations of the elite banking cabal. cushy banking jobs are only given to those deemed worthy by the ‘four horsemen’ of banking who are among the top ten stock holders of practically every fortune 500 company and who come from only eight families. according to global finance magazine the world’s five biggest banks are all based in rothschild

Article 8 - congress cheats with insider trading
congress cheats with insider trading (before it's news) finally, an issue both republicans and democrats can agree upon, halting the practice of exempting congress from ethical laws that apply to the rest of us. but instead, our elected members of congress are ignoring their partisan differences and uniting together against the wishes of constituents of both parties. why don’t insider trading laws apply to members of congress? how can members of congress vote objectively on issues affecting companies they are heavily invested in? a new rasmussen poll found that 48% of americans believe most members of congress are corrupt. congress’s approval rating has slipped to a shocking new low of just 5%. the third most popular stock owned by members of congress is bank stock – which no doubt influenced the financial bailouts. 57 members have stock in bank of america. senator dianne feinstein (d-ca) owns between half a million and one million dollars in bank of america stock. the eighth most popular stock owned by congress is wells fargo, another recipient of government bailouts. john kerry (d-ma) owns the most stock in wells fargo, somewhere between $$350,000 and $$765,000 in shares. corporate insiders are banned from insider trading because it gives them an advantage everyone else does not have. congressional investors have a better trading record than average investors, so how are they any different? members of congress and their staff outperform other investors by 6% to 25

Article 7 - bank widens offer to repay fund holders amid inquiry
the bank is at the center of a growing group of companies scrambling to head off any actions by regulators in their widening inquiry into mutual fund trading. last week alone, alliance capital management suspended two employees for their role in fund trading, and fred alger management, another investment firm, suspended three executives. prudential securities fired 12 brokers and managers for their role in questionable fund trading, and merrill lynch fired three senior brokers. many other fund companies have said that they are responding to requests for information from regulators. yesterday, franklin resources, parent company of the franklin, templeton and mutual series funds, confirmed that it had received a subpoena from the attorney general's office. ''this request for information in no way implies any wrongdoing,'' the company said in a statement on its web site. franklin prohibits what is known as late trading, that is trading in fund shares after the market close at prices based on the value of the shares at 4 p.m. it also has restrictions on market timing, or rapid trading of shares in mutual funds. such practices are being investigated by regulators, who have called them widespread. bank of america said yesterday that it would refund any money lost by investors at other fund companies whose shares were improperly traded by canary, as well as holders of its nations funds, assuming they were not already reimbursed by canary or other third parties. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Article 8 - banks to the rescue; many think the time is ripe to lure savers
and some banks are even harking back to the age when consumers got toasters for opening new accounts. (these days, you're more likely to get a cellular phone.) it is too early to tell if banks' efforts are paying off. but in the first quarter, deposits at banks grew about 10 percent from the period a year earlier, according to an analysis of federal reserve data by credit suisse first boston. that is a healthy gain given the slowing in the economy and the fact that the first quarter is usually when people withdraw money to pay taxes or cover bills left from christmas, said susan roth, a banking analyst at credit suisse. during the first quarter of 2000 deposits grew only about 6 percent from the prior year. many analysts and consultants say the bank marketing push is long overdue after more than a decade of indifference toward the deposit business. in recent years, it seemed banks were promoting almost anything but savings accounts, as they hawked mutual funds and online trading. in fact, banks took savings customers so much for granted that the rate on the average statement savings account dropped much faster than interest rates in general, from 5.22 percent in 1990 to 1.58 percent last month, according to bankrate.com. ''banks were essentially pushing their clients toward mutual funds,'' said alvaro demolina, treasurer of bank of america. ''i think we have all been short-sighted on this issue.'' consumers have not been oblivious

Title: wilbur ross's firm exits u.k.'s virgin money with stake sale
Content: wilbur ross’s firm exits u.k.’s virgin money with stake sale (2) donal griffin and ruth david nov 17, 2016 6:55 am et (bloomberg) -- wl ross & co., the investment firm managed by billionaire wilbur ross, raised 171.5 million pounds ($214 million) by selling its remaining 12 percent stake in virgin money holdings uk plc. shares in the british challenger bank fell the most in four months. the new york-based money manager doubled the size of the stake it had originally planned to sell to about 54 million shares at 320 pence apiece after strong demand from investors, according to a statement on thursday. virgin money, a lender started by fellow billionaire richard branson, was down 6.3 percent to 317.3 pence at 11:22 a.m. in london trading. the company, led by chief executive officer jayne-anne gadhia, is among the u.k.’s so-called challenger banks backed by hedge- and private-equity funds that have emerged since the financial crisis. ross, who scoured europe for finance assets after the crash, agreed to buy a stake in the bank for 100 million pounds in 2010. “while this may therefore satisfy some of that demand in the short-term, the share price will ultimately be determined by the fundamental outlook for the group, which we think is supportive of a higher valuation,” gary greenwood, an analyst at shore capital with a buy rating on the shares. bank of america corp. and goldman sachs group inc. sold the shares on behalf of ross’s firm, according to the statement. ross and simon hall, a spokesman for virgin money, didn’t comment. ross, who committed more funds to virgin money after his first purchase, began selling his firm’s stake with the lender’s 2014 initial public offering. sales included 45 million shares in april 2015 at 400 pence each for 180 million pounds, and then 50 million shares at 405 pence apiece for 203 million pounds five months later. virgin money’s earnings next year will be reduced by bond repayments and new expenditure, while mortgage interest rates have fallen since may, ian gordon, an analyst in london with investec plc, wrote in a note to clients. these are reasons for “slight caution,” wrote gordon, who has a hold rating on the shares. the stock has declined 17 percent this year, though has recovered 15 percent since since being hurt by britain’s vote to leave the european union. ross also invested in lenders in ireland, cyprus and greece after the crash. in 2014, he sold his stake in dublin-based bank of ireland plc for a profit of about 500 million euros ($535 million). ross is u.s. president-elect

Article 4 - military junta stabs turkey in the back
military junta stabs turkey in the back (before it's news) recep tayyip erdoğan’s figure has become one of the most talked about and damnable both among the west and allies of russia after the shooting down a russian fighter jet incident. at various internet resources i’ve read loads of flame that would be enough to try this man as an instigator, a traitor of his nato allies’ interests, his son’s aider and abettor in isis oil reselling, a smuggler supplying arms for daesh terrorists, and a dictator pressing for the new ottoman caliphate. you must admit that all those features add up to an extremely unflattening hitler-like epic character. it is unlikely that someone would elect this person as their president. meanwhile before his presidency erdoğan had been prime minister of turkey for eleven and a half years. i think that turks had got enough chances to apprehend him as a politician and a leader. that is why they granted the majority of their voices for him and his party. however since the mid of 2013 erdoğan has been dogged by political scandals. the taksim square protests were the first fruits. it looked suspiciously similar in organization to the previous arab spring wave, which struck mena countries in 2010-2013. incidents “with the involvement of the head of state” started to mushroom before the 2014 presidential

is russia coming for america? if not then why did putin just do this… % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by lisa haven as many as 50 senior naval officers have been “purged” by russia’s vladimir putin due to the fact that they are refusing to confront western ships…at least that is the claim surfacing from international affairs analyst peter coates, who states that the “buzzing of the uss donald cook by russian su-24 fighter-bombers was meant to be part of a broader series of russian confrontations against western ships in the baltic. but the russia baltic fleet, however, refused to follow such dangerous orders—hence putin’s retaliation against his own naval officers.” what brings this particular event prime attention is the fact that such a massive amount of officers being ousted has not happened since stalin’s error and as a result it is ringing many alarm bells. considering putin has been instigated by the west could this be a warning to the white house? or is russia truly preparing for war with the west. the video below details all that and more… more critical reads you need to hear by lisa haven! click here! subscribe to my website at: www.freedomnationnews.com check me out on youtube for more information see: http://www.dailymail

washington post deceives public & profits from fake news (before it's news) 21st century wire says… the washington post has been caught lying and deceiving the public twice in the last few weeks pushing the unfounded mainstream media meme that russia invaded the u.s. electric grid and another claiming that russia is behind the explosion of so-called ‘fake news.’ considering that the power grid story was proven to be a fake news story that washpost had to later retract… we have to consider the legitimacy of any further claims the outlet has against russia as particularly dubious. the intercept has some interesting analysis on how outlets such as washpost not only deceive the public, push false state sponsored talking points but also how they profit financially from this collusion. glenn greenwald the intercept in the past six weeks, the washington post published two blockbuster stories about the russian threat that went viral: one on how russia is behind a massive explosion of “fake news,” the other on how it invaded the u.s. electric grid. both articles were fundamentally false. each now bears a humiliating editor’s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: the first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom. the second story on the electric grid turned out to be far worse than i realized when i wrote about it on saturday, when it became clear that there was no “pen

Article 1 - demonic muse
in “buddha’s little finger,” pelevin imagined the merging of post-­communist russia and consumerist america as a doomed joyride on a jet fighter piloted by arnold schwarzenegger, taken by a russian mental patient who goes by the name maria. unseatbelted and exposed to the elements, she straddled a wing of the plane, clutching a tumescent antenna as schwarzenegger zoomed impassively through the sky, ultimately crashing. in “homo zapiens,” a poetry translator changes careers after the u.s.s.r. “improved so much that it ceased to exist.” he becomes an advertising copywriter, creating impenetrable ads that impress the boorish, money-hungry “new russian” target audience — because the ads’ inane content proves that the company paying for the advertising is so stinking rich, it can afford to “simply flush a million dollars down the tubes.” confused by what all this means? so is the novel’s hero, but he receives clarifications from che guevara, who sends him lengthy communiqués about television, identity and dualism via ouija board. one of the adman’s bosses also helps direct his mission. “first you try to understand what people will like,” he tells him, “and then you hand it to them in the form of a lie. but what people want is for you to hand them the

Article 2 - where is cuba going?
because my wife and her family have living relatives in cuba, they can get a humanitarian exception that lets you fly direct from miami. the legal loopholes combining to make that possible must fill hard drives. but you can in fact go that way, if you obtain one of these exceptions or are immediate family with someone who does. i first tagged along 12 years ago. it’s hands down the strangest way to travel to cuba, which you might not expect, because technically it’s the simplest. but the airport bureaucracy in miami was so heavy, at least back then, you had to show up the night before and stay in an airport hotel so you could wake up early and spend the day in a series of bewildering lines, getting things signed or stamped. that first time, the tedium was alleviated by a little cluster of miami relatives who followed us to and through each line, standing slightly off to the side. i spoke hardly any spanish then. my wife told me they were giving her all sorts of warnings about havana and messages for various people in their town. now and then one of them would rub my arm and smile warmly at me, gestures that i took to mean, “words aren’t necessary to express the mutual understanding of familial connection that we now possess,” but that when i think about it now, would have been identical to those signaling, “you, simpleton.” one line was for having your luggage wrapped in plastic. a couple of

Article 3 - professor scarry has a theory
it was an unlikely forum for a scientific expose. to make sure the authorities didn't miss her dense, 20,000-word essay -- sandwiched between a review of a book on 18th-century culture and an exchange on northern ireland -- she sent a copy to james hall, chairman of the national transportation safety board. the agency eventually allocated several hundred thousand dollars for fresh research into emi. what's more, scarry's work was cited on the first page of a nasa study of emi commissioned by t.w.a. 800 investigators. these were remarkable coups for an english professor who had no formal training in aviation science and who had never been near a crash site. anyone else might have stopped there, but scarry wasn't through. this fall, she published two more articles in the new york review, expanding her emi hypothesis to include swissair flight 111, which went down near nova scotia after an electrical fire in september 1998, and egyptair flight 990, whose fatal plunge into the atlantic near nantucket last october was caused, many experts believe, by a co-pilot on a suicide mission. as an explanation for any of these plane crashes -- let alone all three -- scarry's theory is generally considered extremely unlikely. (ultimately, the n.t.s.b. ruled out emi as a factor in the t.w.a. disaster.) but more interesting than whether she turns out to be right

Article 4 - the departed
well, hold on to your hats. “2666” is the permanently mysterious title of a bolaño manuscript rescued from his desk after his passing, the primary effort of the last five years of his life. the book was published posthumously in spanish in 2004 to tremendous acclaim, after what appears to have been a bit of dithering over bolaño’s final intentions — a small result of which is that its english translation (by natasha wimmer, the indefatigable translator of “the savage detectives”) has been bracketed by two faintly defensive statements justifying the book’s present form. they needn’t have bothered. “2666” is as consummate a performance as any 900-page novel dare hope to be: bolaño won the race to the finish line in writing what he plainly intended, in his self-interrogating way, as a master statement. indeed, he produced not only a supreme capstone to his own vaulting ambition, but a landmark in what’s possible for the novel as a form in our increasingly, and terrifyingly, post-national world. “the savage detectives” looks positively hermetic beside it. “2666” consists of five sections, each with autonomous life and form; in fact, bolaño evidently flirted with the notion of separate publication for the five parts. indeed, two or three of these might be the equal of his masterpieces at novella length, “by night in chile” and “

Article 5 - travel
in bird's letters, you hear the enticing, raucous voice of a woman who is thoroughly enjoying a wide range of inappropriate behavior. the nomad: the diaries of isabelle eberhardt (interlink, paper, $12.95), edited by elizabeth kershaw, is rather different: a rich but fragmented chunk of pure romantic agony. the diaries were found in the aftermath of the flash flood that killed their author, a young russian woman who became an islamic mystic, pursuing unofficial love and her own spiritual bent (and hashish and booze) through the sands of the sahara in the early 1900's. most travel books just arrive. this one has a much more powerful impact because it's about longing -- for the algerian soldier eberhardt loves, for spiritual revelation, for a simple, wandering life with just a horse and ''a few servants barely more complicated than my mount.'' eberhardt was a 60's icon. the hashish helped; so did her habit of dressing as a man to travel more freely. what's particularly striking is how her impossible passions break against the conventions of her time, conventions of writing as well as living. rupert isaacson's desert is the kalahari, home to the bushmen who may have the oldest human culture on earth and who have long deserved the attentions of a levelheaded writer who wouldn't simplify their magic and ruination into a sentimental legend of the

Article 6 - real men of genius
in 1960, herman kahn, a fellow at the rand corporation in santa monica and a model for the character dr. strangelove, published a book, “on thermonuclear war,” in which he made the case for limited nuclear war by way of championing civil defense. the effects of radioactive fallout, he argued, were grossly exaggerated. americans could hide in backyard shelters, deep caverns and fortified mine shafts. kahn further suggested that food might be labeled according to its contamination level, with the degree expressed in five different grades; grade d food would thus be restricted to people over 40 or 50, and e would be for animals. kahn’s colleagues weren’t amused. “burn it” was the lapidary verdict of his chum and rival albert wohlstetter, when he saw the tome in manuscript form. perhaps wohlstetter, a gourmand and oenophile, was most enraged by the suggestion that grade d would be acceptable fare. other aggrieved rand scholars felt the book trivialized their sophisticated theories about nuclear warfare. but as alex abella suggests in “soldiers of reason,” an entertaining and fast-paced account of the rand corporation, kahn ended up inadvertently capturing something essential about the madcap think-tank world of the defense intellectuals, which was permeated with jargon like “n + 1” and “counter­force first strike.” rand, which pravda called “the

Article 7 - soviet dreams
a superstitious tradition, meant to protect children from vengeful spirits, persists in spanish-­speaking countries — naming babies for the opposite qualities that benevolent parents might be expected to wish upon their offspring. parents who want their daughters to lead joyful lives might name them dolores (“sorrows,” “pain”) or soledad (“loneliness”). a boy might be called tristán (“the sad one”). but andrey platonov, the beleaguered soviet writer who died in 1951 of tuberculosis (contracted from his son, who had been infected in stalin’s gulag), seems to have pursued the reverse strategy when, in the mid-1930s, he began work on an allegorical novella entitled “happy moscow,” to see whether it was “objectively impossible” to write a bona fide “soviet” work of fiction. russians, of course, are superstitious in their own way. whistle indoors, shake hands across a threshold or, if you’re female, sit on the grass, and you’ll soon discover your error. but in naming, russians tend to follow a practice of literalness and optimism — as any babushka called traktorina or lenina, any woman called lyubov (“love”), any man known as boris (“fighter for glory”) can attest. but “happy moscow” didn’t meet with a happy fate when platonov gave

Article 8 - the glass girl
the god who begat a jackal by nega mezlekia. 242 pp. new york: picador usa. $23. there's a special style that goes with the fairy story -- a style with great and self-contained energy, as if told by a cold child, in which horror is recorded alongside wonders. its heroes may be vapid, but its villains positively burst with life. destinies are cruel, bizarre and casual. there is also a sense of events existing outside the usual limits of time, so that ''storytellers, poets, chroniclers and admirals crossed mountains and valleys to witness'' the action, as they do in nega mezlekia's new book. mezlekia is best known for his powerful memoir of war and famine in ethiopia, ''notes from the hyena's belly,'' and only slightly less well known for bringing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit in canada (where he now lives) against an editor who claimed she'd written a big chunk of it and been denied credit. this time, he's writing a novel, and, unsurprisingly, his acknowledgments thank two other editors. unfortunately, he isn't in modern ethiopia anymore; he's slipping gratefully away from precise time and place. in ''the god who begat a jackal,'' mezlekia takes the elements of the simplest of fairy stories -- forbidden love, an heiress and a storytelling slave -- and embroiders them lushly. his heiress

ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY
-------------------
Title: riddle wrapped in a mystery
Content: it’s a spooky feeling, if you’re a translator who loves bicycling and word games and likes traveling to russia, to open a book and encounter, in the very first chapter, a translating, cycling crossword fanatic who is plucked from a kaliningrad beach by a homburg-hatted butcher, hurled into a carcass-strewn meat van and never heard from again. (note to self: avoid kaliningrad.) at the time he was nabbed, the translator was carrying a notebook he’d used at a session of multilingual, high-stakes business negotiations. his abductor, flipping through the pages, was infuriated to find them filled with illegible doodles — stars, bugs, cats and spirals — the translator’s own private code. “let the birds read it,” the butcher declared, flinging the notebook into the wind. local children later found it in the sea grass. could this collection of rebuses hold the key to the deaths of a muckraking journalist, tatiana petrovna, and a slimy oligarch, grisha grigorenko, in moscow, 700 miles away? what else might it conceal? the reporter bought the notebook from the kids in kaliningrad just before she died. might it, therefore, be dangerous to attempt to decode it? in “tatiana,” his eighth crime novel dominated by the lawless landmass once known as the soviet union, martin cruz smith sets his slavic sleuth, arkady renko, on the case. like his fellow thriller writer, the late tom clancy, smith hasn’t let the end of the cold war deter him from raking the formerly evil empire for bloodcurdling tales of suspense and intrigue. even after the u.s.s.r. ceased to exist, both authors kept a cool war nicely chilled, piling ice on the corpus delicti to keep the frisson intact. while both men have written of submarines, suicides, murders and mayhem, soldiers and statesmen, and the machinations of the k.g.b., f.s.b. and c.i.a., smith has always had a lighter, more emotional touch. the main event of a tom clancy novel is always its precise, technically detailed plotting, but it’s the human factor that takes center stage for martin cruz smith. his protagonist, arkady renko, senior investigator for very important cases in the moscow prosecutor’s office, is a hangdog, underdog hero — romantic in a diffident, chain-smoking way, like rick blaine in “casablanca.” unlucky in love, mistrusted by the higher-ups, renko has a soft spot for outcasts (he’s the guardian of a surly teenage chess hustler named zhenya) and a conscience that goads him to put himself at risk to serve truth, justice and the arkady renko way of life. photo early in “

In the US, tax havens offer legitimate functions for individuals and businesses to reduce taxes. However, many Americans harbor misconceptions about tax havens being only for the wealthy or multinational corporations.

The Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement (RAM) promotes violence against police, theft of goods, and armed insurrection. An armed RAM group is launching a new cell in Philadelphia, with support from alternative media.

Slavery is not limited to the US South; it has existed throughout history and across cultures. Modern-day slavery includes forced labor, arranged marriages for underage children, and hereditary bondage.

According to Walk Free Foundation, there are 30 million slaves worldwide, including 60,000 in the US. Companies like Apple, Boeing, and Intel profit from slave labor.

The global economy is structured to funnel wealth to the top 0.1%, with 85 super wealthy individuals having more money than the poorest 3.5 billion combined. The financial system's flaws lead to increased poverty and oppression.

The International Criminal Court's first trial was marred by disputes between judges and the prosecutor, with relations becoming ""ugly and unhealthy."" The trial involves a Congolese militia leader accused of enlisting thousands of boys and girls under 18 to fight or provide sex.

Ending slavery is a bipartisan cause with widespread public support. Both Republicans and Democrats included platform planks to combat human trafficking during their national conventions.

Amnesty International is consulting on a policy for the protection of sex workers, who are subject to discrimination, violence, and abuse worldwide. The organization is not considering a policy on the right to buy sex.

Homosexuality in the priesthood has come under increasing scrutiny, with some bishops asking for studies on priests' sexuality but others quashing the idea. The Philadelphia diocese reported 35 priests accused of abuse, while victims' lawyers claim to have assembled lists of over 1,000 priests accused in the US.

NBC News fired Matt Lauer after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. The company's swift action demonstrates its susceptibility to public moral suasion.

Article 5 - no magic to slavery
no magic to slavery % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) how people associate slavery with the south of the u.s.a. during the pre-civil war period is a great injustice to the south because slavery is not new, nor was it invented by those southerners. slavery began long before america was settled, and its principles lie deeply rooted in the period of organized religion and mankind as far back as egypt when the first tribe conquered another and wondered what to do with them. putting them to work seemed a natural option to increase the profits of the controllers. slaveowners and slaveholders are not so different in fashion as they are in form from a legal perspective. one need not wield the whip in order to subdue expendable persons. mutuality is not a part of the slavery experience; never is, and never has been. slavery is the use of other persons for private benefit regardless of whether the slave also manages to gain some benefit by the experience. inequality is built into the formula as one is meant to provide a benefit for the other. violence need not be an element of the offense; exploitation is. whether it is derived from distorted labor wages, and coerced labor conditions, or pure slavery, the potential for slavery exists in all financial arrangements – collective or individual – the degree of mutuality controling whether or not sufficient benefit resides on both sides of the equation. slavery is a relationship, not an act. it may

Article 6 - proof that the usa is controlled by foreign corporations
proof that the usa is controlled by foreign corporations (before it's news) pao l. chang, guest waking times one of the greatest tricks that the new world order (nwo) did to enslave the people of the world was to secretly create a corporate version of counties, cities, states, and countries. by doing this, the leaders of the nwo and their minions were able to trick us to unknowingly agree to be “agents” or “employees” of these corporations through the use of fraudulent contracts (i.e., birth certificate, social security card, driver’s license). the information in this article is more focused on the usa, because i am more familiar with the so called laws in the usa and the u.s. legal system. if you do not live in the usa, you should still read this article for the reason that the same legal system that has enslaved americans is the same legal system that has enslaved most people of the world. the “laws” in the usa are not really laws; instead, they are acts and statutes of the united states, incorporated. in other words, they are rules of a corporation. like any corporation (i.e., walmart, target), you are not bound to the rules (acts and statutes) of the united states, inc. unless you agree to be a citizen (“employee”) of this corporation. the only laws you (the natural living, breathing person) are bound to are the laws of nature. did you know the

Article 7 - where do today’s slaves live?
where do today’s slaves live? (before it's news) it’s easy to think of slavery as a thing of the past when it’s not visible in our everyday lives. but the cold hard truth is slave labor still exists in many forms, and it’s time to do something about it. the anti-slavery nongovernmental organization walk free foundation is doing its part to address the issue by raising awareness about modern day bondage with its global slavery index. defined by the group as several different types of forced labor, the term “slavery” includes arranged marriages for underage children and other forms of sexual exploitation, as well as hereditary bondage and, most prominently, work in the private sector under slave conditions. and by this definition, according to walk free, there are 30 million slaves in the world, and 60,000 of them live in the united states. here’s a list of some of the companies that profit from slave labor, according to the atlantic: this summer, an australian man imprisoned in china reported that prisoners were making headphones for global airlines like qantas and british airways. some 300,000 sets of the disposable headphones were made by uncompensated prisoners who were forced to work without pay and regularly beaten. the index says that there are about 3 million slaves in china, in state-run forced labor camps, at private industrial firms making electronics and designer bags, and in the brick-making industry. companies like apple, boeing and intel—

Article 8 - 85 super wealthy people have more money than the poorest 3.5 billion combined
(before it's news) the global economy is structured to systematically funnel wealth to the very top of the pyramid, and this centralization of global wealth is accelerating with each passing year. according to the united nations, 85 super wealthy people have more money than the poorest 3.5 billion people on the planet combined. and 1.2 billion of those poor people live on less than $$1.25 a day. there is something deeply, deeply broken about a system that produces these kinds of results. seven out of every ten people on the planet live in countries where the gap between the wealthy and the poor has increased in the last 30 years. despite our technological advances, somewhere around a billion people go to bed hungry every single night. and when our fundamentally flawed financial system finally does collapse, it will be the poor that will suffer the worst. now, let me make one thing clear at the outset. big government and more socialism are not the answer to anything. big government and more socialism almost always result in increased oppression and increased poverty. if you want to see where that road ultimately leads to, just look at north korea. what we need is a system that empowers individuals and families to work hard, be creative, build businesses and to take care of themselves. but instead, we have a system where all power and all wealth are increasingly controlled by giant banks and giant corporations that are in turn controlled by the global elite. the “financialization” of the global economy has

Article 1 - girls on our streets
i’ve often reported on sex trafficking in other countries, and that has made me curious about the situation here in the united states . prostitution in america isn’t as brutal as it is in, say, india , nepal , pakistan , cambodia and malaysia (where young girls are routinely kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured by brothel owners, occasionally even killed). but the scene on american streets is still appalling — and it continues largely because neither the authorities nor society as a whole show much interest in 14-year-old girls pimped on the streets. americans tend to think of forced prostitution as the plight of mexican or asian women trafficked into the united states and locked up in brothels. such trafficking is indeed a problem, but the far greater scandal and the worst violence involves american teenage girls. if a middle-class white girl goes missing, radio stations broadcast amber alerts, and cable tv fills the air with “missing beauty” updates. but 13-year-old black or latina girls from poor neighborhoods vanish all the time, and the pimps are among the few people who show any interest. photo these domestic girls are often runaways or those called “throwaways” by social workers: teenagers who fight with their parents and are then kicked out of the home. these girls tend to be much younger than the women trafficked from abroad and, as best i can tell, are more likely to be controlled by force. pimps are not the business partners they purport to be. they typically take

Article 2 - conservatives draw blood from acorn
in response to the acorn videos, an instant hit on youtube, the senate voted 83 to 7 on monday to prohibit the department of housing and urban development from giving federal housing money to the organization. the bill’s advocates said the group had received $53 million in such financing since 1994. last friday, the census bureau dropped acorn as one of 80,000 national unpaid “partners” helping promote the 2010 census, saying the group’s involvement might “create a negative connotation” and discourage participation in the population count. on tuesday, the house republican leader, representative john a. boehner of ohio, wrote to president obama asking him to cut off all federal financing to acorn and its affiliates. “it is evident that acorn is incapable of using federal funds in a manner that is consistent with the law,” mr. boehner wrote. the undercover videos showed a scantily dressed young woman, hannah giles, posing as a prostitute, while a young man, james o’keefe, accompanied her. they visited acorn offices in baltimore, washington, brooklyn and san bernardino, calif., candidly describing their illicit business and asking the advice of acorn workers. among other questions, they asked how to buy a house to use as a brothel employing under-age girls from el salvador. mr. o’keefe, 25, a filmmaker and conservative activist, was dressed so outland

Article 3 - for international criminal court, frustration and missteps in its first trial
“the whole trial has been a nightmare since the disputes between judges and the prosecutor began in 2008,” said william a. schabas, who teaches human rights law at the national university of ireland, galway, and follows the court. relations between the bench and the prosecution have become “ugly and unhealthy,” he said. “there appears almost a breakdown between the two sides.” mr. lubanga, 49, a onetime psychology student, has sat through the proceedings variously wearing a dark suit or african robes, looking somber and impassive, sometimes staring at witnesses. he was sent to the hague in 2006 by congolese authorities who had imprisoned several militia leaders from the democratic republic of congo’s complex wars — involving years of protracted fighting fueled by ethnic strife and rivalries for power and mineral riches. mr. lubanga’s group, the union of congolese patriots, was among the militias accused of massacring civilians in 2002 and 2003. prosecutors say that mr. lubanga was accountable for the enlisting, often by force, of several thousand boys and girls, some as young as 8, who were drugged and trained to kill, steal or mutilate civilians, and in the case of girls, to provide sex to militiamen. the prosecution presented video of mr. lubanga visiting militia camps in the presence of child soldiers. the defense maintains that mr. lubanga was only a

Article 4 - free the slaves: ending slavery is something all voters agree on
ending slavery is something all voters agree on 11/09/2016 11:46 am et free the slaves we liberate slaves around the world and change the conditions that allow slavery to persist. with the divisive 2016 election now behind us, and calls for healing and unity coming from political leaders, it's important to note that the fight against modern slavery is a bipartisan cause with widespread public support. when the new congress convenes and president-elect donald trump takes the oath of office in january, anti-slavery initiatives will create opportunities for cooperation and progress. both republicans and democrats included platform planks to combat human trafficking during their national political conventions, with similar themes. the republican platform: ""we will use the full force of the law against those who engage in commercial sexual exploitation and forced or bonded labor of men, women, or children; involuntary domestic servitude; trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal; and the illegal recruitment and use of child soldiers.... we call for increased diplomatic efforts and accountability for foreign governments to prosecute traffickers, including penalties for any public officials who may be complicit in this devastating crime. we will highlight the need to stop slave labor, taking steps to prevent overseas labor contractors who exploit foreign workers from supporting military bases abroad or exporting goods to the united states. a republican administration will strategize with partners around the world to prevent the demand for trafficking victims that makes exploitation lucrative and will prosecute sex tourists and domestic buyers to the fullest extent

Article 6 - homosexuality in priesthood is under increasing scrutiny
no reliable statistics exist about either the extent of the abuse or broader questions about the sexuality of the clergy. a church built on a theoretically chaste priesthood has had little interest in commissioning or even permitting such studies. eugene kennedy, an emeritus professor of psychology at loyola university of america, said that in the last 15 years american bishops had asked him more than once to conduct a study of priests' sexuality, but that other bishops had quashed the idea. concerning sexual abuse, the church has not kept comprehensive records on how many priests have been accused or found guilty, though the recent scrutiny has prompted some dioceses to review 50 years of personnel records and compile lists of problem priests. the philadelphia diocese, for example, reported 35. still, the only nationwide effort at record-keeping has been done by victims' lawyers like sylvia demarest in dallas and jeffrey anderson in st. paul, who claim to have assembled lists of more than 1,000 priests accused of abuse in the united states. it is unknown how many of these accusations involve men who are no longer in the priesthood, were wrongly accused, or whose cases date back four or more decades. there are currently 46,075 priests in the united states. scientists who have studied sexual offenders warn that the scandal in the church has caused two distinct issues -- homosexuality and child abuse -- to become erroneously and recklessly intertwined. they note that homosexuals

Article 7 - nbc didn’t fire matt lauer. we did.
photo social media takes a lot of punches for enabling sexual harassment. but the past two months have shown that it has also provided consumers with an unprecedented power to make their market preferences heard loud and clear. and right now, the market is demanding that companies do something about sexual predators and pests in their midsts. the firing of matt lauer — the “today” show star who reportedly commanded a salary of $25 million per year — by nbc news is just the latest example of a company moving swiftly to protect its brand in the face of sexual misconduct allegations. the obvious take here is that the chairman of nbc news, andrew lack, made a cold economic calculation: mr. lauer might have been a rainmaker for the network, but keeping him on was no longer worth it in the face of potential lawsuits, damage to the brand and lower ratings. reading the just-published details of mr. lauer’s alleged behavior, failing to fire him seems unthinkable. he reportedly showed his penis to a colleague, bought another a sex toy with an accompanying note about how he wanted to use it on her and had a secret button under his desk to lock his office door from the inside. and that’s just the first wave of reporting. but there’s another, more positive, takeaway from mr. lauer’s firing, which is that corporations are susceptible to the moral suasion of the public. this might not look like what millennials imagine when they talk about “corporate social responsibility”

Article 8 - nigerian 'sex-slaves' disrupt obama narrative on islam
islamic law permits the possession of concubines, or sex slaves. this has been demonstrated countless times, including through islamic clerics quoting islamic scriptures, and through ordinary muslims, past and present, acting on it. that said, islamic sanctioned sex-slavery does not perturb the western world simply because the powers-that-be-specifically academia, media, and government-ignore it, and all other unsavory phenomena associated with islam, out of existence. interesting, therefore, are the responses from the authorities-comical one might even say-when one of these everyday anecdotes actually does surface to the general public. enter the recent abduction of nearly 300, mostly christian, teenage schoolgirls in nigeria at the hands of boko haram, yet another islamic terrorist organization plaguing mankind. as expected, the group justified its actions in islamic terms, with its leader declaring on video, ""i abducted your girls. i will sell them on the market, by allah….there is a market for selling humans. allah says i should sell."" of course, for those in the know, none of this is surprising. in march 2012, boko haram warned that it would do just this, declaring that it was preparing to ""strike fear into the christians of the power of islam by kidnapping their women."" moreover, of all the human rights abuses i catalog in crucified again: exposing islam's new war on christians-and these are

Article 6 - medical examiner revises suspect’s death ruling to homicide
medical examiner revises suspect’s death ruling to homicide % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) gina barton of the journal sentinel writes: the milwaukee county medical examiner’s office has revised its ruling on the death of derek williams, who died in milwaukee police custody in july 2011, from natural to homicide, according to the district attorney’s office. the decision came after the journal sentinel alerted an assistant medical examiner to newly released records – including a video of a suffocating williams pleading for help from the back of a squad car – and also made him aware of a national expert who said williams, 22, did not die naturally of sickle cell crisis. in making his initial determination of natural death more than a year ago, assistant medical examiner christopher poulos did not review all of the police reports or a squad video recently obtained by the newspaper. the video shows a handcuffed williams, his eyes rolled back, gasping for breath and begging for help in the back seat of a milwaukee police car as officers ignore his pleas. the police reports include key details about williams’ arrest that the medical examiner didn’t know. as a result of the new ruling, milwaukee county district attorney john chisholm is reopening his investigation into whether criminal charges are warranted against any of the officers involved. chisholm, the police department and the fire and police commission previously had

Article 7 - cop nearly kills innocent man in front of 7-yo daughter. when you find out why, you’ll be furious
an innocent man was mistakenly pulled over by an arizona state trooper and threatened to be shot in the back in front of his daughter. recently, true activist enlightened readers on the various reasons police officers in the u.s. kill more people per day than cops in norway have in the past decade. in addition to undergoing drastically less time in training, cops in the u.s. are not educated on how to de-escalate situations. instead, they enter situations with defensive, fear-based mentalities and, as was witnessed in the case of alton sterling and philando castile, oftentimes end up hurting more people than helping. recently, the world was presented with another example of this. a man named ken walton was driving around in a rental car with his 7-year-old daughter when an arizona state trooper pulled him over. the facebook post he shared relays that without warning, the situation quickly escalated. walton wrote: “tonight, i was arrested at gunpoint by an arizona highway patrol officer who threatened to shoot me in the back (twice) in front of my 7-year-old daughter. for a moment, i was certain he was going to kill me for no reason. i’m alive, and i need to share the story. please share it, because i have an important reason for staying up past 1 a.m. to write it down.” the pair was pulled over in williams, arizona. walton thought the

Article 1 - the strauss-kahn case
long after tuesday’s dismissal of sexual assault charges against dominique strauss-kahn, people will still be debating the facts and how the manhattan district attorney, cyrus vance jr., handled the high-profile case. what seems clear is that mr. vance was right to notify mr. strauss-kahn’s lawyers and the court in july about troubling inconsistencies in the account of the accuser, nafissatou diallo, and to drop the charges this week. there is a legitimate concern that his decision may discourage rape victims from coming forward in the future. women who have been assaulted often worry, with reason, about being victimized a second time in court. and those with problematic backgrounds must feel confident that they can demand and receive justice. we will never know what really happened in that hotel room. in the 25-page dismissal motion, prosecutors recounted the inconsistencies in ms. diallo’s three conflicting descriptions of what happened during and after the alleged assault at a manhattan hotel. they said they were also troubled by a “pattern of untruthfulness” about her past, including a convincingly delivered, though fictional, story of being gang raped by soldiers in her native guinea and a recorded conversation that prosecutors say captured her discussing making money from the case, which her lawyer disputes. advertisement continue reading the main story dna evidence showed mr. strauss-kahn “engaged in a hurried sexual encounter” with his accuser, but there was insufficient evidence to establish

Article 2 - doubts in cold case that was thought solved
early on the morning of that oct. 13, ms. otten awoke to thumping sounds and moaning. she heard a door shut and found ms. antonetti on the couch, holding her head. “i didn’t recognize her, and she was covered in blood,” ms. otten recalled during mr. davis’s trial last year. she called 911 and woke johnny. his mother was unable to answer his questions about what had happened. before she slipped into a coma at the hospital, she kissed him. “that was it,” he told the jury. “she didn’t regain consciousness again.” donn chelli, who lived in the same apartments, also called 911 that morning. he reported seeing a tall, husky man with long, blond hair holding a bat. (mr. davis was shorter, thinner and had dark hair and a mustache.) mr. chelli confronted the blond man, who angrily said that mr. chelli was the second person who had bothered him that night. the men quickly parted ways, and mr. chelli called the police, who made a composite sketch of the man he described. later, mr. chelli tentatively identified john martin odem in a police lineup as the man with the bat. mr. odem, known as marty, also lived in the complex and was convicted in 1986 of breaking into another woman’s apartment there and raping her. he denied killing ms. anton

Article 3 - man sues denver police, saying forced confession at 14 put him in prison
the civil rights complaint, filed june 14 in united states district court, seeks a jury trial. it names the city and county of denver, and several individual officers and detectives as defendants. a spokesman said the police department does not comment on pending litigation, and the acting city attorney, shaun sullivan, said late monday that his office had not yet been served with court papers and could not comment. the montoya case is the latest in which dna tests helped free people from prison. at least 342 criminal convictions in the united states have been reversed with the testing since 1989; 96 of those cases involve forced confessions, according to the innocence project, which tracks the statistics. ms. fisher-byrialsen also represents kharey wise, who won a $12 million settlement from new york city after serving 13 years in prison in the central park jogger case. defense attorneys said those teenage suspects had been tricked or coerced into confessing, and mr. wise and four others were later exonerated by dna and other evidence. the montoya lawsuit was reported by local colorado outlets last week, including the denver post and fox 31, which broadcast taped excerpts from the confession. after 2 a.m. on new years day of 2000, the 29-year old special education teacher, emily johnson, was assaulted at her denver house and later died of her injuries. the lawsuit says mr. montoya

Article 4 - peterson jury is asked to put aside feelings for defendant
""if you presume this guy is guilty, you can put a sinister spin on anything,"" said mr. geragos, later reminding jurors, ""you must not be influenced by sentiment, conjecture or passion."" the prosecution argued that mr. peterson killed his pregnant wife to escape the drudgery of married life and fatherhood, all in an effort to follow a fantasy to lead the life a wealthy jet-set bachelor, free to travel the world seeking adventure. but in his closing, mr. geragos sprinted through a series of other explanations for all of mr. peterson's contradictory statements and erratic behavior after his wife disappeared on or around dec. 23, 2002. for example, mr. geragos replayed the period around the time of ms. peterson's disappearance. he pointed to little-discussed facts like confiscated records on internet activity the morning ms. peterson may have disappeared, showing that someone had been looking at a gap advertisement and printing french toast recipes. mr. geragos argued that those facts proved that ms. peterson was home and alive on dec. 24, when mr. peterson left for a brief fishing trip. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing.

Article 5 - businessman ordered jailed in dispute with utility
a judge threw the company’s case out, finding any fault was entergy’s; the utility is appealing. but before the case against mr. seeber was dismissed, judge kearn a. reese of state civil court ordered mr. seeber to make no mention of the injury case to anyone at entergy except for two lawyers he designated. in his role as a self-styled consumer advocate, mr. seeber later sent a 400-page report to mr. leonard, contending that entergy had filed fraudulent financial statements for two decades. (yolanda pollard, an entergy spokeswoman, said the company conducted a thorough internal investigation and determined the fraud allegations were nothing but “propaganda.” marcus v. brown, a lawyer for entergy, said the company never told mr. seeber about its findings because “we aren’t required to.”) on monday, mr. brown established that in the 400-page report, there were passing mentions of the injury case on pages 205 and 209. entergy asked for a 45-day jail sentence as punishment for contempt of court. judge reece sentenced mr. seeber to 30 days on tuesday but suspended all but 7 because mr. seeber showed that he had tried to remove references to the injury case from his report and that the two passing mentions were inadvertent. the judge said he would waive any jail time provided mr. seeber wrote a letter of apology to mr.

Article 6 - no apologies about fighting for the victims
''i feel that, other than the date, it really is an identical legal issue,'' he says. ''the victims on 9/11 were killed because they worked at the trade center, a symbol of american capitalism, and danny pearl was killed because he worked for the wall street journal, which i consider a consummate symbol of american capitalism.'' after being contacted by mr. remes, and after reading ms. pearl's memoir, ''a mighty heart: the brave life and death of my husband, danny pearl,'' mr. kelner joined the case at no charge and advised her to file with the fund even though he knew her circumstances technically disqualified her. ''we're going to have future victims, and this is a legal issue that has to be addressed,'' he says. ''what the pearl case really is a manifestation of is the unfortunate focus we have to place on terrorism, this being the manifestation in the legal sense. if people are being killed because they're americans, i don't think this government can turn its back. there should be a separate statute to cover terror victims, and i'm not just talking about funeral expenses and the cost of transporting a body. the pearl case isn't political. it's about doing the humane thing.'' newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and

Article 7 - man arrested in california case of child's abduction and killing
he said that thousands of tips from the public, an investigation involving hundreds of officers and help from the news media in circulating a description of the suspect had all helped to assemble what he called a quick resolution to the manhunt. while he said a trail of evidence had led investigators to mr. avila, sheriff carona emphasized that the investigation was far from over and that he did not want the stream of information that poured in from callers to dry up just because a suspect had been arrested. ''you have been our allies all along,'' he said, referring to the news media and public. ''this in no way concludes our investigation. we are still trying to make sure we bring this man to justice.'' police officials here have made it clear that their evidence, which is believed to include items like fibers that were found on the body, ties mr. avila to the girl, who was sexually assaulted and suffocated before being left on the edge of a road called killen trail near lake elsinore. mr. avila had worked since september as an assembler at the temecula, calif., plant of the guidant corporation, an indianapolis company that makes cardiac and vascular products like pacemakers and coronary stents. mr. avila, who is in custody, lived with his mother at a low-income apartment complex in lake elsinore, about 60 miles from stanton and about 10 miles from the roadside scrub where samantha's body was found. some

Article 8 - suspect in rape absorbed pain and inflicted it
''he is a complete lunatic,'' said michael sheehan, a former homicide investigator whose work helped prosecute mr. reyes for the murder of lourdes gonzalez. ms. gonzalez, 24, was raped and stabbed nine times in her basement apartment on east 97th street in june 1989. her three small children were listening through a bedroom door as their pregnant mother was sexually assaulted, then murdered. two other women who survived their encounter with mr. reyes told the police that he had given them a stark choice at knife point -- your eyes or your life. they took the first choice, and then he stabbed them around the eyes, although the wounds proved superficial, according to investigators. in the attack on the jogger, her injuries were so severe that several detectives who worked on the case continue to believe it could not have been the work of just one man. mr. reyes, now 31, was finally captured in august 1989, four months after attacking the jogger. by his own account now, he had committed one murder, five rapes, two attempted rapes and an untallied number of muggings. he was caught by two men in the lobby of a building on east 91st street after a woman who had just been raped in her apartment dashed down the stairs in a towel. ''even as a child growing up in the school system, he exhibited violent behavior,'' said richard siracusa,

Title: city settles with officer fired after remarks on diallo case
Content: a former police officer who sued the city charging that she was fired for criticizing the police department after the 1999 shooting of amadou diallo will be reinstated and allowed to retire with benefits, one of her lawyers said yesterday. under the settlement of the lawsuit with the officer, yvette walton, the police department will also has pay her $327,500 for back pay and legal fees. she was reinstated as an officer with the understanding that she will retire with a full pension, according to court documents. mrs. walton was dismissed on the same day in april 1999 that she appeared in disguise, her face hidden by the tightly drawn hood of a sweatshirt, at a city council meeting and spoke about what she contended was a pattern of civil rights abuses by the department's street crime unit. the unit had been under scrutiny since four of its officers fatally shot mr. diallo, an unarmed west african immigrant, on feb 4. 1999, firing at him 41 times. in the weeks after the shooting, mrs. walton appeared in disguise at a news conference, on the abc news program ''nightline'' and before the council to detail her accusations of racial profiling by the unit. advertisement continue reading the main story when she was fired in april, the department bristled at the suggestion that it had been done in retaliation for her criticism. ''this is a police officer who did not bring credit in any way, shape or form upon this department and shouldn't be a police officer, and that's why she was dismissed,'' the police commissioner, howard safir, said at the time. mayor rudolph w. giuliani also criticized the news media for their handling of the coverage of mrs. walton's dismissal, saying, ''the way you're attacking the police department is to the point of perversity.''

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
A series of articles discuss various high-profile cases involving allegations of assault, murder, and false confessions. In the Strauss-Kahn case, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. dropped charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn after inconsistencies in the accuser's account were revealed. DNA evidence showed a ""hurried sexual encounter"" but insufficient evidence to establish guilt.

In another case, doubts have been raised about a cold case that was thought solved. A woman named Nafissatou Diallo accused her employer of assault, but her account contained inconsistencies and a pattern of untruthfulness. The case against Strauss-Kahn's accuser was dropped due to these concerns.

A man named Marty Odem was convicted in 1986 of breaking into another woman's apartment and raping her. However, DNA evidence has since cleared him of the crime. A similar case involves Emily Johnson, who died after being assaulted at her home. Her husband, Johnny Davis, was accused of murder but claimed he had been asleep.

In a civil rights complaint, a man named Montoya claims that police coerced him into confessing to a crime and that DNA evidence has since cleared him. The case is one of many in which forced confessions have led to wrongful convictions.

A jury is being asked to consider the case of Michael Peterson, who was accused of killing his pregnant wife. Prosecutors argue that he killed her to escape fatherhood, but defense attorneys claim there are alternative explanations for his behavior.

In another case

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of disturbing incidents have come to light, highlighting issues with power dynamics and accountability. A 20-year-old nurse was arrested for secretly recording two residents at an assisted living facility without their knowledge or consent, posting the video on social media.

In another incident, a police officer in Arizona threatened to shoot an innocent man in front of his 7-year-old daughter after mistakenly pulling him over. The officer had a history of not receiving adequate training on de-escalation techniques.

A mother in Florida was arrested at a children's splash park for wearing a wet shirt that exposed her padded bra, leading to charges of obstruction of justice and resisting arrest. She is suing the city for what she claims was discriminatory treatment.

In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a medical examiner revised its ruling on the death of a 22-year-old man who died in police custody after pleading for help from the back of a squad car. The decision came after newly released records revealed that the man did not die naturally.

A toddler went missing in North Carolina and was later found dead, with her live-in boyfriend arrested for concealing her death and obstruction of justice. He has a long history of criminal charges, including assault and threats to government officials.

These incidents highlight issues with power imbalances, lack of accountability, and inadequate training or education among some individuals in positions of authority.

(before it's news) by todd walker i love my pathfinder 32 oz. bottle cooking kit… except for one thing… the bag. the bag is such a useful piece of kit and i hated its one glitch. the nesting cup caught on the interior of the nylon bag when storing or removing the set. i filed the bat-wing handle attachment but the cup still snagged the bag liner. oh well, i thought i’d have to live with it. christian c rescued my bag by making a simple, yet brilliant, modification on his youtube channel which saved me the gnawing frustration each time i used my cup in the field. you can check his video out at the bottom of this post. as many of you know, i’m a container freak! and this mod not only fixes the bag snag but also adds yet another metal container to my cook kit. i’m a redundancy freak too. all you need is a #3 tall can from the grocery store. i stopped by our mom and pop grocery store on my way back from some quality dirt time yesterday and bought the cheapest can of tomato juice on the shelf. i walked in with my tape measure to make sure the can would fit my pf bag. the can’s dimensions are 4 1/4 inches in diameter by 7 inches tall and holds about 45 oz. i paid $$

(before it's news) i’m late with today’s post, but that’s one of the things i love about summer: no set time to do most things. alas, that’s probably why i run behind most of the summer. i take my own sweet time to do just about everything! this post was inspired by the watermelon i was eating today. you see, i absolutely love watermelon. my dad used to raise these monster watermelons that weighed more than i did! i was thinking about all the things you get to do in summer that just aren’t doable in winter. so here’s my list–in no particular order or preference. 10 things i love about summer 1. watermelon. has there ever been a sweeter, juicier fruit? i think not. watermelon can’t be frozen or canned. it can only be enjoyed fresh so i buy one just about every week during the summer. i purchase the weekly melon from trucks parked by the roadside or in the supermarket. they’re all good. 2. dark sweet cherries. oh! so delicious but expensive so i don’t buy as many as i would if they were the price of, say, apples. 3. riding in my car with the top down. i’ve always loved convertibles. this is the second i’ve owned. we’re talking about selling it but… i really don’t want to. no matter how bad my mood, i can get in

Article 6 - christmas ale fruit loaf
christmas ale fruit loaf (before it's news) i was given home baked by eric lanlard a few months ago and have finally got round to making one of his cakes. i’ve done the recipe for his ale fruit loaf but in the spirit of the season i used harvey’s christmas ale instead of a regular one. the recipe also lists wholemeal self-raising flour as an ingredient. as i didn’t have any in the cupboard i used wholemeal spelt flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder to the mixture. i do love fruit cake and wensleydale cheese – i think that is my yorkshire roots coming out – and this cake is perfect for that combination. did you know by the way that wensleydale cheese production also had to finish in the 1990s due to such low sales. it was however featured in the wallace & gromit animations and sales shot up saving this lovely cheese which was originally created by french cistercian monks who settled in wensleydale in the 14th century. in his book eric also suggests serving it toasted and buttered with raspberry jam which would be delicious too. either way this is a great cake for eating in front of the tv on those days between christmas and ny just as it’s getting dark outside and it’s all cosy inside (or while typing up a blog post….). this cake is also my entry into december’s tea time treats, a monthly baking challenge hosted

scotch bonnet (before it's news) latest post from marksvegplot – a blog about food and gardening in england” regular readers will know that i am very fond of growing chillis. as it happens, jane and i don’t eat vast quantities of chillis, and we don’t particularly like the “scorch the tips off your taste-buds” type of chilli. we prefer tasty chillis with a medium amout of heat. so why then, you may ask, am i growing a scotch bonnet chilli? scotch bonnet is very hot, verging on the volcanic. well the answer is – i felt sorry for it! last autumn i saw this rather gangly little plant being sold off in an end-of-season sale at my local garden centre for a mere 50p, and bought it. at the time when i bought it, it had precious few leaves, but it did have three green fruits, which subsequently ripened to a beautiful bright red colour. the fruits were used in a batch of chilli oil i made as a gift for my brother-in-law, and wow, were they hot! i would have considered my 50p well spent if that had been the end of the tale, but since then i have nurtured the plant, feeding it every so often with baby bio plant food, and it has grown to be enormous. a couple of days ago i took it outside in the garden for some fresh air

the black awnings and brick facade of sweet rexie’s exterior belie the many colors within. a long row of acrylic cylinders hangs from one wall dispensing, for $3 a quarter pound, all kinds of treats — from candy necklaces and malted milk balls (both milk and dark chocolate) to cherry rock candy and chocolate-covered potato chips. the m & m’s alone come in two dozen shades. there are also bins filled with fireballs, mary janes, jolly ranchers, bit-o-honey, jawbreakers and smarties. for more mature tastes, look for godiva chocolates by the cash register ($24 for a 7.2-ounce box) as well as a selection of truffles including dark raspberry, dark caramel with sea salt, milk cappuccino, and dark tiramisu ($1.25 each). and an ice cream case by the door features 16 flavors, from a fluorescent “play-doh” to praline pecan and plain vanilla (from $2.75 to $4.50). sweet rexie’s also makes good on its slogan, “so much more than a candy store,” with an array of gift items — plush animals, craft kits, monster trucks — largely for young children and newborns. these are available singly ($10 and up) or as part of gift baskets. candy, of course, is featured in most baskets, but those designed for children ($50 to $125) come with a

honey ridge farms balsamic honey vinegar is a very nice addition to the pantry, though it certainly was not made according to the centuries-old italian method, and thus is not a true balsamic. it bears a resemblance, however, to common balsamics on the market because caramel is one of the ingredients. despite its name, it is an honest product; even the caramel is made with honey. it is mellow enough to use for salads and to add a splash of acidity when deglazing a pan. photo it is made in brush prairie, wash., by fifth-generation beekeepers who will donate a portion of the price to research on the health of bee colonies. the vinegar is $13.99 for 8.45 ounces from www.honeyridgefarms.com.

Article 3 - cherries' garish glory revived
maraschino cherries? why bother?'' this was not the response i was looking for when i mentioned to a friend that i was going to undertake a homemade version. ''what would you use them in besides shirley temples, anyway?'' she added, wrinkling her nose. though she forgot about manhattans and rob roys, she had a point. homemade maraschino cherries are not the most practical of recipes. then again, i'm not always the most practical of cooks. but making maraschino cherries wasn't about practicality, or trying to mimic those vinyl-textured, frighteningly neon and once potentially carcinogenic (remember red dye no. 2?) orbs. i was trying to recapture the glory of a faded confection. a century ago, maraschino cherries were concocted from croatian marasca cherries macerated in their fragrant liqueur. when added to cocktails and desserts, they were an elegant touch. but the temperance movement, a glut of oregon cherries and a preserving process that involved oceans of lipstick-red dye, corn syrup and almond extract conspired to give us a cocktail garnish not highly prized as a fruit. history aside, what i really wanted was something delectable to float in my manhattan. in the height of fresh cherry season, it seemed a worthy pursuit. i surfed online for substitutes for the unavailable marasca. opinions varied from

Article 6 - brownies with caramel: sweet and salty in a committed relationship
the people at baked have experimented with mint, coffee, chile and other variations — but the only one to join the permanent roster is the sweet and salty brownie, an ingenious combination of blond, bittersweet caramel and dark, bittersweet chocolate that now outsells the original. they are not the first bakers to note the affinity of caramel and chocolate, but by emphasizing the bitter, sweet and salty notes in both, they’ve made that rare thing: a perfectly balanced bite. photo it is a spinoff of their sweet and salty cake, a layer cake with multiple components and extraordinary flavors that are equally compelling in the form of a brownie that you can make this very afternoon. in addition to a brownie batter, all it takes is a basic caramel. (do not stop reading. making caramel does involve high heat, but so does making pasta: the process doesn’t have to be terrifying or traumatic.) many recipes for home cooks call for melting down kraft caramels, or using store-bought sauce. that sticky substance is a world away from the creamy, tangy, complexity of this homemade sauce. you can thank the sour cream. and use the extra sauce on ice cream, cookies or cake. here are tips for a painless caramel: use a large saucepan and moderate heat. it’s o.k. if the caramel cooks slowly. use part sugar and part corn syrup, which prevents it from crystallizing, so don’t worry about the caramel seizing

Article 7 - making his case for the second montalcino
well, if i’m going to be the only enthusiastic voice in the room, allow me to make my case. first, what is rosso di montalcino? simply put, it’s a category of wine intended to make life a little easier for brunello producers, who are required to age brunellos a minimum of two years in barrels and two more in bottles before they can sell it. that’s a substantial investment. by contrast, rosso di montalcino must be aged a minimum of only a year, including six months in oak barrels. theoretically at least, this division also permits producers to elevate the quality of the top wine by siphoning off any grapes or wine that does not meet their standards for the brunello. for consumers, rosso ought to be a fresher, easier-drinking wine that does not require prolonged cellar aging. in a word, it ought to be more joyous than contemplative. so, what’s the issue? perhaps it’s the inherent nature of the sangiovese grown in montalcino, which tends to be richer and more concentrated than that grown in the chianti zones. as a result, good chiantis, in which sangiovese is the dominant rather than the sole grape, will generally be more graceful and finer textured than the montalcino. the montalcinos will be denser and more powerful; the best combine muscularity with elegance. i love both expressions. the gorgeous, earthy

Article 1 - save the endangered whistle-blower
if ever government whistle-blowers needed protection from official retaliation it is now, in the secrecy-obsessed bush administration. federal employees daring to disclose fraud and abuse in their bureaucracies have been under virtual siege, isolated as pariahs and shipped off under gag orders to lesser jobs in far-off places. appeals to court review under the 17-year-old whistle-blower protection act have proved fruitless, with the supreme court ruling in may that workers have no right to first amendment protection when they warn lawmakers and taxpayers of government waste and folly. the ruling has thrown the issue back into the lap of congress. fortunately, there is enough anger emerging on both sides of the aisle to raise hopes for remedial legislation. the senate has unanimously approved an amendment to close loopholes and spell out whistle-blowers’ rights in more forceful detail for the courts. it is attached to a pending military bill, with proponents working for comparably tough legislation to be accepted by the house. the outcome is not certain. the justice department has been opposed to strengthening the law, and a countermove is afoot to give the administration even more power to prosecute whistle-blowers as leakers of official secrets. the coming showdown is a chance for electioneering incumbents to take a stand against the administration’s mania for foiling the public’s right to government transparency. the best display of congressional intent would be for lawmakers to not just reaffirm the 1989 law but to extend it to

Article 2 - the tangled threads of russia-gate
exclusive: once a washington groupthink takes hold, as it has in the fervent belief about russia-gate, respect for facts and logic fly out the window since all these important people can’t be wrong, writes robert parry. by robert parry a curious feature about the russia-gate “scandal” is that its proponents ignore the growing number of moments when their evidence undercuts their narrative. instead, they press ahead toward a predetermined destination in much the way that true-believing conspiracy theorists are known to do. for instance, the new york times ran a story on monday, entitled “operative offered trump campaign access to putin,” detailing how a conservative operative “told a trump adviser that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between donald j. trump and vladimir v. putin, the russian president, according to an email sent to the trump campaign” — and apparently described to the times by a helpful source on capitol hill. the times quoted the email from national rifle association member paul erickson to trump campaign adviser rick dearborn as saying, “putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with mr. trump. … [putin] wants to extend an invitation to mr. trump to visit him in the kremlin before the election.” an nra conference in louisville, kentucky, was supposed to be the location for the “first contact” between the russians and the trump campaign, according to the email. the

Article 3 - f.b.i. chief says leak on qaeda plot is being investigated
the prosecutions have had strong bipartisan support from congress but have been sharply criticized by press advocates as misguided crackdowns on whistle-blowers. on wednesday, members of the senate committee endorsed the idea of the investigation. “regardless of political consequences, i hope that you get to the bottom of it,” said senator charles e. grassley, republican of iowa, the ranking member of the committee. “our international partners have been wary of cooperating with us in the wake of the wikileaks affair, in which our ability to keep their confidence was severely damaged.” the a.p. said it learned of the bomb plot two weeks ago but agreed not to publish an article about it in response to pleas from the white house and the central intelligence agency because an intelligence operation tied to the plot was under way. after the operation was completed, the a.p. published an article about how the qaeda affiliate in yemen planned to deploy a suicide bomber with an underwear bomb to blow up a plane headed to the united states. it was later revealed that the underwear bomb was smuggled out of yemen by a double agent working for saudi arabia. mr. grassley asked mr. mueller about the impact of the leak on the united states’ ability to work with its allies. “my hope is that it’ll have minimal impact,” mr. mueller said. “and i know that there are — discussions are going on with our partners overseas to make certain that whatever impact there is is

_____ photo 3. mr. trump’s assertion that former president obama tapped his phone has consumed the white house, the f.b.i., the justice department and the worldwide news media. it is a conspiracy theory that was born on talk radio. the f.b.i. director, james comey, asked the justice department to rebut the assertion as false, but the department has not done so. here are some basics about surveillance — including that the power to order domestic wiretaps resides with federal judges, after applications from the justice department. _____ photo 4. the supreme court announced it would not hear a major case on transgender rights. the justices vacated an appeals court decision upholding the right of a transgender boy, gavin grimm, above, to use the boys’ bathroom at his virginia high school. they sent the case back for further consideration in light of the trump administration’s policy on the issue. separately, the court ruled that jury deliberations need not remain secret when evidence emerges that they were marred by racial or ethnic bias. _____ photo 5. the white house made an offer to planned parenthood: stop providing abortions and you can keep federal funding. advertisement continue reading the main story the group — which does not use its federal funds for abortions — refused. “offering money to planned parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept,” the group’s executive vice president said. _____ photo 6. japan is

Article 5 - house extends surveillance law, rejecting new privacy safeguards
effectively, the vote was almost certainly the end of a debate over 21st-century surveillance and privacy rights that broke out in 2013 after the leaks by the former n.s.a. contractor edward j. snowden. the senate began considering the newly approved house bill on thursday afternoon; senators rand paul, republican of kentucky, and ron wyden, democrat of oregon, are expected to oppose the measure in the coming days. but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, moved to essentially ensure that no amendments to the house legislation would be considered, and it appeared to be on a path to final approval when senators return to washington next week. mr. snowden’s disclosures in 2013 ushered in a period of intense interest in surveillance. civil libertarians and conservative skeptics of government power worked together to push for new limits, while intelligence and law enforcement agencies and their backers in congress from across party lines — and in both the obama and trump administrations — tried to hold the line. the post-snowden privacy movement secured its largest victory in 2015 when congress voted to end and replace one of the programs that mr. snowden exposed, under which the n.s.a. had been secretly collecting logs of americans’ domestic phone calls in bulk. but lawmakers who hoped to add significant privacy constraints to the warrantless surveillance program, too, fell short on thursday. before voting to extend the law,

Article 6 - analysts detail claims that reports on isis were distorted
the revisions presented a more positive picture to the white house, congress and other intelligence agencies, the officials said. “the senior intelligence officers are flipping everything on its head,” said one government intelligence analyst, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. the analyst said that the complaints involve the highest-ranking officials in centcom’s intelligence unit, run by army maj. gen. steven r. grove. the pentagon’s inspector general would not examine disputes over routine differences among analysts, and so it is highly unusual that an investigation would be opened about the intelligence conclusions in an ongoing war. the allegations raise the prospect that military officials were presenting skewed assessments to the white house and lawmakers that were in sharp contrast with the conclusions of other intelligence agencies. the issue is expected to come up wednesday when gen. lloyd j. austin iii, commander of central command, is expected to testify before a senate panel about the military campaign against the islamic state. “we do take seriously any allegations of the mishandling or manipulation of intelligence information for purposes other than getting to ground truth,” representative adam schiff of california, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said tuesday. “in the wake of the flawed intelligence prior to the iraq war, we must make sure that all voices are appropriately considered and that assessments are never again politicized.” last week, mr. schiff said that the intelligence presentations that lawmakers get from spy agencies

Article 7 - role of telecom firms in wiretaps is confirmed
cindy cohn, legal director for the electronic frontier foundation, which is heading up the lawsuit against at&t, said her group might ask the appeals court to consider mr. mcconnell’s comments in deciding whether the state-secrets argument should be thrown out. “they’ve really undermined their own case,” ms. cohn said. mr. mcconnell said those suits were a driving force in the administration’s efforts to include in this month’s wiretapping legislation immunity for telecommunications partners. “if you play out the suits at the value they’re claimed,” he said, “it would bankrupt these companies.” congress agreed to give immunity to telecommunications partners in the measure , but refused to make it retroactive. mr. mcconnell, who took over as the country’s top intelligence official in february, warned that the public discussion generated by the congressional debate over the wiretapping bill threatened national security because it would alert terrorists to american surveillance methods. “now part of this is a classified world,” he said in the interview. “the fact we’re doing it this way means that some americans are going to die.”. asked whether he was saying the news media coverage and the public debate in congress meant that “some americans are going to die,” he replied: “that’s what i mean. because we have made it so public.” mr. mcconnell, though, put new information on the public record in the interview, on aug. 14 while in texas

the f.b.i. has interviewed dozens of members of the house and senate intelligence committees and asked them to submit to lie detector tests as part of an effort to learn who leaked classified material to reporters in the wake of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, congressional officials said today. but a number of the lawmakers on the committees have refused to take the polygraph tests and have voiced uneasiness over the constitutional precedent of being investigated by the agency they oversee, the officials said. ranit schmelzer, a spokeswoman for senator tom daschle of south dakota, the majority leader, said the inquiry had provoked ''grave concerns about the constitutional separation of powers issues raised by having one branch of government administering a polygraph to employees of another branch.'' still, ms. schmelzer said, the matter ''is between the house and senate intelligence committees and the justice department.'' advertisement continue reading the main story the committee had asked that the f.b.i. conduct the investigation into accusations of leaks of secret information by someone affiliated with the committee and, ms. schmelzer said, it was up to the bureau and the committee officials to develop appropriate guidelines. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred.

ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY
-------------------
Title: conductive rigid skeleton supported silicon as high-performance li-ion battery anodes
Content: this congressional hearing will blow you away! they just proved “this” major conspiracy as fact

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of articles claim a major conspiracy was proven as fact in a congressional hearing. The articles share similar language and structure, stating the same phrase (""this"" major conspiracy) without providing specific details or evidence.

The articles appear to be repetitive and lack concrete information about the conspiracy or the congressional hearing. They do not provide sources, dates, or names of individuals involved, which are common characteristics of reliable news reports.

The tone is sensational, using phrases like ""big breaking news"" and ""will blow you away."" This style is often associated with clickbait or misleading content. The articles also lack specificity, failing to provide context or details about the hearing or the conspiracy.

Overall, the articles seem to be lacking in substance and credibility, relying on vague language and sensational tone rather than providing concrete evidence or facts.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Key points:

* The US government has been criticized for its handling of whistleblowers, with the Supreme Court ruling that workers have no right to First Amendment protection when warning lawmakers and taxpayers about government waste.
* A Senate amendment aims to strengthen whistle-blower protections, but the Justice Department opposes it.
* The FBI is investigating a leak on a Qaeda plot, which may have damaged international cooperation due to the WikiLeaks affair.
* The Trump administration has been accused of tapping former President Obama's phone, with some officials claiming this was done without proper authorization.
* A surveillance law has been extended by Congress, despite efforts to add significant privacy constraints.
* Analysts claim that reports on ISIS were distorted, with senior intelligence officers allegedly presenting skewed assessments to the White House and lawmakers.
* Telecom firms have confirmed their role in wiretaps, but some lawsuits may challenge this immunity.
* The FBI is investigating a 9/11 leak, which has raised concerns about constitutional separation of powers issues.

These points highlight key issues related to government transparency, surveillance, and accountability.

the president's speech explains why nobody counts on u.s. leadership anymore % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) obama is a one-man wrecking ball. further proof of what i describe in my article today the american thinker, here. it bears noting that the article proved so popular, and garnered so many comments that they moved it up to the lede story - “iran drama obscures concerns over obama approach to mideast,” by elise labott in cnn, september 25, 2013 (thanks to robert spencer) the drama over whether president barack obama would shake hands with his iranian counterpart detracted from what diplomats at the u.n. general assembly described as an acute disappointment with his handling of mideast turmoil. a perceived lack of leadership in syria during its civil war coupled with u.s. handling of the political crisis in egypt has forced the obama administration to confront a growing lack of confidence among middle east allies. but what’s most bewildered american allies in the region was obama’s abrupt decision to back away from threats to use military force over alleged syrian chemical weapons use in favor of a diplomatic approach to divest it of those stockpiles. they fear obama’s ambivalence foreshadows a lack of mettle in dealing with iran. told earlier this month strikes against syria were imminent, arab states were “shocked,” according to one

Article 3 - world must unite against us-saudi-israeli proxy war in syria
(before it's news) us, saudi arabia, and israel have conspired to destroy syria by way of arming sectarian extremists since 2007. the west now admits it, along with saudi arabia and qatar, have provided thousands of tons of weapons to militants in syria – while also conceding that al qaeda’s syrian franchise, jabhat al-nusra is the best armed, most well equipped militant front in the conflict. al-nusra is the best armed, most well equipped militant front in the conflict. us, saudi, israeli-backed terrorists are now committing a myriad of horrific atrocities against all of syria’s population, including sunni muslims – meaning neither “democracy” nor even “sectarianism” drives the conflict, but rather the destruction of syria in its entirety. us state department acknowledges syria faces threat from al qaeda, demands blockade of arms/aid from reaching government to fight terrorists the us state department admits are present in every major syrian city. march 30, 2013 (ld) – since 2007, the us, saudi arabia, and israel have been documented as conspiring to overthrow the syrian government by way of sectarian extremists, including groups “sympathetic to al qaeda,” and in particular, the militant, sectarian muslim brotherhood. while the west has attempted to portray the full-scale conflict beginning in syria in 2011 as

Article 4 - israels plan for syria
(before it's news) by israel shamir moscow. israel retains its ability to control the syrian ‘islamist’ rebels. netanyahu is not worried about syria’s possible disintegration. despite the received wisdom claiming that israelis prefer a stable and familiar assad to the great unknown of islamic guerrillas, the new and sensational information we received points out to the opposite, namely: israelis prefer the somalisation of syria, its break-up and the elimination of its army, as this will allow them to tackle iran unopposed. this is implied in a secret file recently leaked by a person(s) apparently close to the israeli minister of foreign affairs avigdor lieberman. it contains a record of conversations between bibi netanyahu, avigdor lieberman and russian president vladimir putin during the latter’s recent visit to israel. israelis seem to have no doubts about its authenticity. counterpunch received the original file, and here are the highlights of this conversation (in our translation from hebrew): netanyahu asked putin to facilitate bashar assad’s departure. “you can appoint his successor, and we shall not object , said the israeli prime minister. “there is one condition – the successor must break with iran». putin responded: we have no candidate for bashar’s successor. do you? no, we don’t, replied netanyahu, but

Article 5 - the great middle east conspiracy and the end times
the great middle east conspiracy and the end times (before it's news) by bill wilson, daily jot news service wash–feb 9–djns–america and its western allies appear to be inching closer to yet another war in the middle east. conspiracy theories abound of the us fighting israel’s wars for it; of the us fighting saudi arabia’s wars for it; of the us wanting to spread democracy in the middle east; there are many more. no substantial action has been taken against iran’s nuclear program. the us and western allies have assisted the islamic and muslim brotherhood effort to overthrow governments in the middle east. saudi arabia has spent millions upon millions of dollars to influence us and european politicians, especially the bush family, the clintons, and the current white house. has the us become a tool of islam in middle east policy? as head of the un international atomic energy agency egyptian islamist mohamed elbaradei stalled any substantial action against iran’s nuclear program by insisting that iran was not seeking to build a nuclear weapon from 2003 till near the end of his term in 2009. at that time he expressed regret that iran had not implemented any of the security measures suggested by the un. now elbaradei is a central figure in the so-called “democratization” of egypt where radical islamists have won the popular vote and vow to establish

Article 6 - endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama
endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama (before it's news) on sunday, we noted that washington’s strategy in syria has now officially unravelled. john kerry, speaking from london following talks with british foreign secretary philip hammond, essentially admitted over the weekend that russia’s move to bolster the assad regime at latakia effectively means that the timing of assad’s exit is now completely indeterminate. here’s how we summed up the situation: moscow, realizing that instead of undertaking an earnest effort to fight terror in syria, the us had simply adopted a containment strategy for isis while holding the group up to the public as the boogeyman par excellence, publicly invited washington to join russia in a once-and-for-all push to wipe islamic state from the face of the earth. of course the kremlin knew the us wanted no such thing until assad was gone, but by extending the invitation, putin had literally called washington’s bluff, forcing the white house to either admit that this isn’t about isis at all, or else join russia in fighting them. the genius of that move is that if washington does indeed coordinate its efforts to fight isis with moscow, the us will be fighting to stabilize the very regime it sought to oust. revelations (which surprised no one but the pentagon apparently) that moscow is coordinating its efforts in syria with tehran only serve to reinforce

Article 1 - obama again tips the scales toward caution on syria
although mr. obama has gotten virtually no credit for that achievement, the lesson of the episode is hardly lost on him. on thursday, asked about military action in syria, he dwelled on the role of diplomacy in an effective strategy against the group, the islamic state in iraq and syria. “the issue with respect to syria is not simply a military issue, it’s also a political issue,” mr. obama said at the white house. “it’s also an issue that involves all the sunni states in the region and sunni leadership recognizing that this cancer that has developed is one that they have to be just as invested in defeating as we are.” some longtime critics of the president said they were encouraged by his restraint. his comments, they said, recognized that airstrikes alone would not be sufficient to defeat isis in syria. it will require a ground component, which can succeed only if the united states and its allies strengthen the moderate opposition in syria. that, in turn, will require persuading saudi arabia, qatar, the united arab emirates and others to coordinate their support for the rebels. for now, the outside support goes to several groups, including radical ones, like the nusra front, which the state department classifies as a terrorist organization. mr. obama’s comments do not mean that he would refrain from striking isis leaders in syria if the united states got intelligence on their whereabouts. he could give that

Article 2 - israeli-saudi alliance slips into view
exclusive: the israeli-saudi détente is slowly emerging from the shadows, with a media report on a secret jerusalem meeting and israeli prime minister netanyahu’s oblique reference in his un speech. but this powerhouse collaboration could mean trouble for u.s. diplomacy in the mideast, reports robert parry. by robert parry on aug. 29, when i published an article entitled “the saudi-israeli superpower” describing an emerging odd-couple alliance between those two traditional enemies, the story was met with skepticism in some quarters. but, increasingly, this secret alliance is going public. on oct. 2, israel’s channel 2 tv news reported that senior israeli security officials met with a high-level gulf state counterpart in jerusalem, believed to be prince bandar bin sultan, the former saudi ambassador to the united states and now head of saudi intelligence. and, a day before that tv report, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu hinted at the new relationship in his united nations general assembly speech, which was largely devoted to excoriating iran over its nuclear program and threatening a unilateral israeli military strike. amid the bellicosity, netanyahu dropped in a largely missed clue about the evolving power relationships in the middle east, saying: “the dangers of a nuclear-armed iran and the emergence of other threats in our region have led many of our arab neighbors to recognize, finally

Article 3 - militants are said to amass missiles in south lebanon
still, officials worry that the buildup of so many rockets could tempt hezbollah to expand its operations. adding to this worry is the fear that iran or syria might encourage hezbollah to stir up tensions along israel's northern frontier to divert attention from iraq and complicate the bush administration's plans to topple saddam hussein. according to some analysts, neither iran nor syria wants to see an american occupation of iraq because they fear that it could be a platform for washington to project more power throughout the region. ''we may have to face this problem on the eve of going into iraq,'' said dennis ross, the clinton administration's special envoy to the middle east. ''i think there is a strong impulse on the part of the iranians and to a lesser extent the syrians to head us off in iraq because they fear they could be next. if suddenly there is a war raging between israel and its neighbors, that creates pressure to deal with that issue first and shifts attention away from iraq. the europeans and the arabs will be saying first things first.'' there is no consensus, however, as to iran's and syria's intentions. some israeli officials and analysts said that an american confrontation with iraq and the deployment of thousands more american troops in the region could make iran and syria more cautious and reduce the chances of an escalation of tensions along the israel-lebanon border.

related content view photo suddenly, trump has three middle east crises on his hands president-elect trump, a novice in foreign affairs, was destined to confront reality. who would have guessed that the middle east is the first place he’ll have to get down to his first serious policy decisions? even a week ago it looked like russia would force trump to prove his mettle. will he or won’t he stick to his famously controversial idea of a new détente with moscow? all of a sudden, syria, iran, and israel all clamor for trump’s judgments. long before his glittery inaugural ball, the new president will have to clarify whether he’s going to stick to his campaign commitments or alter course. related: outlines of trump foreign policy are largely uncharted territory in each case, what trump and his foreign policy team decide could shift the u.s. away from strategies and alliances that have endured for many decades. if trump does what he has said in the past he will, the middle east will look very different from washington. trump has been given an imperative any new president would have to address. since september 24, 2013, when hassan rouhani, iran’s reformist president, spoke at the u.n. and opened the door to negotiations on the nation’s nuclear programs, all the pieces in the middle east puzzle were bound to be rearranged. what distinguishes trump is that he has been willing to say so. president obama, even

Article 6 - unrest in syria and jordan poses new test for u.s. policy
with 61 people confirmed killed by security forces, the country’s status as an island of stability amid the middle east storm seemed irretrievably lost. for two years, the united states has tried to coax damascus into negotiating a peace deal with israel and to moving away from iran — a fruitless effort that has left president obama open to criticism on capitol hill that he is bolstering one of the most repressive regimes in the arab world. officials fear the unrest there and in jordan could leave israel further isolated. the israeli government was already rattled by the overthrow of egypt’s leader, hosni mubarak, worrying that a new government might not be as committed to egypt’s 1979 peace treaty with israel. while israel has largely managed to avoid being drawn into the region’s turmoil, last week’s bombing of a bus in jerusalem, which killed one person and wounded 30, and a rain of rocket attacks from gaza, have fanned fears that the militant group hamas is trying to exploit the uncertainty. the unrest in jordan, which has its own peace treaty with israel, is also extremely worrying, a senior administration official said. the united states does not believe jordan is close to a tipping point, this official said. but the clashes, which left one person dead and more than a hundred wounded, pose the gravest challenge yet to king abdullah ii, a close american ally. sy

Article 7 - the impulse to intervene
the invasions of afghanistan and iraq followed by failed nation-building may have taught the u.s. government a few lessons in humility, but the temptation to intervene in crises around the world remains strong, with recent examples in syria and south sudan, notes the independent institute’s ivan eland. by ivan eland despite its massive annual federal budget deficits and national debt, the american superpower continues to meddle in faraway countries that pose little direct threat to u.s. national security. examples of those nanny-like interventions have recently occurred in syria and south sudan. the u.s. pentagon and state department, having learned the wrong lessons from post-american-invasion iraq, are now planning for a post-assad syria. undeterred by that previous mess, u.s. planners are busily concocting grandiose plans to remodel syria’s society, security, economy, and political system, despite the objection of the syrian opposition to foreign “transition plans.” according to the new york times, rafif jouejati, a spokesman for a network of syrian activists, said, “what we don’t want to do is descend into the total chaos that iraq did. i don’t think we want the united states to impose lessons learned here.” but those alleged lessons from iraq are exactly what u.s. officials are trying to implore the syrian rebels to learn. the officials are cautioning the syrian

Content: mr. mekdad even hinted that syria might have hopes of turning the tables and driving a wedge between the arabs and the united states on the question of iran’s nuclear capabilities. “i think the west is more concerned about the iranian nuclear file than the arabs,” mr. mekdad said. “i think our brothers in saudi arabia understand that the threat is not iran, it is the israeli nuclear capability. this policy of double standards is making all arabs angry.” those sentiments are not likely to be welcomed any more warmly in the saudi capital than they are in washington . but for the moment, the syrian leadership is not feeling any real pressure to detach itself from iran. in fact, a number of syrian analysts have sounded a triumphant note in recent weeks, suggesting that after emerging intact from the deep freeze of the bush years, syria has more power to dictate the terms of its new relationship with washington. at the same time, some figures in the syrian leadership are said to be uneasy about the new outreach from the obama administration, which may prove to be less advantageous than it seems. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. “there are some here who miss the bush administration, because at least with them you knew where you stood,” said one syrian analyst who is close to the leadership, but spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to come under scrutiny for exposing differences of opinion. “with obama, the american demands have not really changed, but there is an impression of a new era and an expectation of new results from us.” nevertheless, there may be real opportunities for diplomatic progress, in part because some of the issues that divided syria and the united states in recent years appear to have subsided. last year’s doha accord resolved the political crisis, at least for now, in lebanon , where the united states long accused syria of playing a destabilizing role. syria and saudi arabia are also said to have reached an agreement not to interfere in the lebanese parliamentary elections in june, and syria and lebanon have established formal diplomatic ties. in iraq , syria’s goals are now similar to those of the united states, analysts say. despite its history of enabling jihadists to fight american troops in iraq, syria is now contemplating an imminent american withdrawal and is keenly aware that it might itself become a jihadist target, especially if it concludes any sort of peace deal with israel. “syria increasingly sees an interest in iraqi stability,” said

Article 1 - save the endangered whistle-blower
if ever government whistle-blowers needed protection from official retaliation it is now, in the secrecy-obsessed bush administration. federal employees daring to disclose fraud and abuse in their bureaucracies have been under virtual siege, isolated as pariahs and shipped off under gag orders to lesser jobs in far-off places. appeals to court review under the 17-year-old whistle-blower protection act have proved fruitless, with the supreme court ruling in may that workers have no right to first amendment protection when they warn lawmakers and taxpayers of government waste and folly. the ruling has thrown the issue back into the lap of congress. fortunately, there is enough anger emerging on both sides of the aisle to raise hopes for remedial legislation. the senate has unanimously approved an amendment to close loopholes and spell out whistle-blowers’ rights in more forceful detail for the courts. it is attached to a pending military bill, with proponents working for comparably tough legislation to be accepted by the house. the outcome is not certain. the justice department has been opposed to strengthening the law, and a countermove is afoot to give the administration even more power to prosecute whistle-blowers as leakers of official secrets. the coming showdown is a chance for electioneering incumbents to take a stand against the administration’s mania for foiling the public’s right to government transparency. the best display of congressional intent would be for lawmakers to not just reaffirm the 1989 law but to extend it to

Article 2 - the tangled threads of russia-gate
exclusive: once a washington groupthink takes hold, as it has in the fervent belief about russia-gate, respect for facts and logic fly out the window since all these important people can’t be wrong, writes robert parry. by robert parry a curious feature about the russia-gate “scandal” is that its proponents ignore the growing number of moments when their evidence undercuts their narrative. instead, they press ahead toward a predetermined destination in much the way that true-believing conspiracy theorists are known to do. for instance, the new york times ran a story on monday, entitled “operative offered trump campaign access to putin,” detailing how a conservative operative “told a trump adviser that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between donald j. trump and vladimir v. putin, the russian president, according to an email sent to the trump campaign” — and apparently described to the times by a helpful source on capitol hill. the times quoted the email from national rifle association member paul erickson to trump campaign adviser rick dearborn as saying, “putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with mr. trump. … [putin] wants to extend an invitation to mr. trump to visit him in the kremlin before the election.” an nra conference in louisville, kentucky, was supposed to be the location for the “first contact” between the russians and the trump campaign, according to the email. the

Article 3 - f.b.i. chief says leak on qaeda plot is being investigated
the prosecutions have had strong bipartisan support from congress but have been sharply criticized by press advocates as misguided crackdowns on whistle-blowers. on wednesday, members of the senate committee endorsed the idea of the investigation. “regardless of political consequences, i hope that you get to the bottom of it,” said senator charles e. grassley, republican of iowa, the ranking member of the committee. “our international partners have been wary of cooperating with us in the wake of the wikileaks affair, in which our ability to keep their confidence was severely damaged.” the a.p. said it learned of the bomb plot two weeks ago but agreed not to publish an article about it in response to pleas from the white house and the central intelligence agency because an intelligence operation tied to the plot was under way. after the operation was completed, the a.p. published an article about how the qaeda affiliate in yemen planned to deploy a suicide bomber with an underwear bomb to blow up a plane headed to the united states. it was later revealed that the underwear bomb was smuggled out of yemen by a double agent working for saudi arabia. mr. grassley asked mr. mueller about the impact of the leak on the united states’ ability to work with its allies. “my hope is that it’ll have minimal impact,” mr. mueller said. “and i know that there are — discussions are going on with our partners overseas to make certain that whatever impact there is is

Article 4 - trump tower, t.s.a., iraq: your monday evening briefing
_____ photo 3. mr. trump’s assertion that former president obama tapped his phone has consumed the white house, the f.b.i., the justice department and the worldwide news media. it is a conspiracy theory that was born on talk radio. the f.b.i. director, james comey, asked the justice department to rebut the assertion as false, but the department has not done so. here are some basics about surveillance — including that the power to order domestic wiretaps resides with federal judges, after applications from the justice department. _____ photo 4. the supreme court announced it would not hear a major case on transgender rights. the justices vacated an appeals court decision upholding the right of a transgender boy, gavin grimm, above, to use the boys’ bathroom at his virginia high school. they sent the case back for further consideration in light of the trump administration’s policy on the issue. separately, the court ruled that jury deliberations need not remain secret when evidence emerges that they were marred by racial or ethnic bias. _____ photo 5. the white house made an offer to planned parenthood: stop providing abortions and you can keep federal funding. advertisement continue reading the main story the group — which does not use its federal funds for abortions — refused. “offering money to planned parenthood to abandon our patients and our values is not a deal that we will ever accept,” the group’s executive vice president said. _____ photo 6. japan is

Article 5 - house extends surveillance law, rejecting new privacy safeguards
effectively, the vote was almost certainly the end of a debate over 21st-century surveillance and privacy rights that broke out in 2013 after the leaks by the former n.s.a. contractor edward j. snowden. the senate began considering the newly approved house bill on thursday afternoon; senators rand paul, republican of kentucky, and ron wyden, democrat of oregon, are expected to oppose the measure in the coming days. but senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the majority leader, moved to essentially ensure that no amendments to the house legislation would be considered, and it appeared to be on a path to final approval when senators return to washington next week. mr. snowden’s disclosures in 2013 ushered in a period of intense interest in surveillance. civil libertarians and conservative skeptics of government power worked together to push for new limits, while intelligence and law enforcement agencies and their backers in congress from across party lines — and in both the obama and trump administrations — tried to hold the line. the post-snowden privacy movement secured its largest victory in 2015 when congress voted to end and replace one of the programs that mr. snowden exposed, under which the n.s.a. had been secretly collecting logs of americans’ domestic phone calls in bulk. but lawmakers who hoped to add significant privacy constraints to the warrantless surveillance program, too, fell short on thursday. before voting to extend the law,

Article 6 - analysts detail claims that reports on isis were distorted
the revisions presented a more positive picture to the white house, congress and other intelligence agencies, the officials said. “the senior intelligence officers are flipping everything on its head,” said one government intelligence analyst, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. the analyst said that the complaints involve the highest-ranking officials in centcom’s intelligence unit, run by army maj. gen. steven r. grove. the pentagon’s inspector general would not examine disputes over routine differences among analysts, and so it is highly unusual that an investigation would be opened about the intelligence conclusions in an ongoing war. the allegations raise the prospect that military officials were presenting skewed assessments to the white house and lawmakers that were in sharp contrast with the conclusions of other intelligence agencies. the issue is expected to come up wednesday when gen. lloyd j. austin iii, commander of central command, is expected to testify before a senate panel about the military campaign against the islamic state. “we do take seriously any allegations of the mishandling or manipulation of intelligence information for purposes other than getting to ground truth,” representative adam schiff of california, the top democrat on the house intelligence committee, said tuesday. “in the wake of the flawed intelligence prior to the iraq war, we must make sure that all voices are appropriately considered and that assessments are never again politicized.” last week, mr. schiff said that the intelligence presentations that lawmakers get from spy agencies

Article 7 - role of telecom firms in wiretaps is confirmed
cindy cohn, legal director for the electronic frontier foundation, which is heading up the lawsuit against at&t, said her group might ask the appeals court to consider mr. mcconnell’s comments in deciding whether the state-secrets argument should be thrown out. “they’ve really undermined their own case,” ms. cohn said. mr. mcconnell said those suits were a driving force in the administration’s efforts to include in this month’s wiretapping legislation immunity for telecommunications partners. “if you play out the suits at the value they’re claimed,” he said, “it would bankrupt these companies.” congress agreed to give immunity to telecommunications partners in the measure , but refused to make it retroactive. mr. mcconnell, who took over as the country’s top intelligence official in february, warned that the public discussion generated by the congressional debate over the wiretapping bill threatened national security because it would alert terrorists to american surveillance methods. “now part of this is a classified world,” he said in the interview. “the fact we’re doing it this way means that some americans are going to die.”. asked whether he was saying the news media coverage and the public debate in congress meant that “some americans are going to die,” he replied: “that’s what i mean. because we have made it so public.” mr. mcconnell, though, put new information on the public record in the interview, on aug. 14 while in texas

Article 8 - f.b.i. inquiry on 9/11 leak upsets lawmakers on committees
the f.b.i. has interviewed dozens of members of the house and senate intelligence committees and asked them to submit to lie detector tests as part of an effort to learn who leaked classified material to reporters in the wake of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, congressional officials said today. but a number of the lawmakers on the committees have refused to take the polygraph tests and have voiced uneasiness over the constitutional precedent of being investigated by the agency they oversee, the officials said. ranit schmelzer, a spokeswoman for senator tom daschle of south dakota, the majority leader, said the inquiry had provoked ''grave concerns about the constitutional separation of powers issues raised by having one branch of government administering a polygraph to employees of another branch.'' still, ms. schmelzer said, the matter ''is between the house and senate intelligence committees and the justice department.'' advertisement continue reading the main story the committee had asked that the f.b.i. conduct the investigation into accusations of leaks of secret information by someone affiliated with the committee and, ms. schmelzer said, it was up to the bureau and the committee officials to develop appropriate guidelines. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred.

(before it's news) boston ma, april 29, 2015 — attorney robert a. adelson (www.executiveemploymentattorney.com) is an expert negotiator when it comes to executive compensation. a key component of these negotiations are often restricted stock units, commonly referred to as rsu stock, or simply restricted stock. rsu stock is a valuable asset for prospective hires who want a piece of the company, as well as venture capitalists trying to hire or retain technical talent, particularly in biotech, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. “big talent want’s big money,” said attorney adelson, “in startups, however, money is sometimes tough to come by. vcs know that hiring the right big talent will help them grow and make more money.” according to attorney adelson, by offering restricted stock units, employers can offer prized employees equity value in the company. this helps keep them from moving for greater pay. likewise, an equity-based signing bonus in the form of restricted stock is a creative way to bring an executive on board without spending huge amounts of cash. “rsu stock can lower tax costs. negotiating the vesting of the stock correctly can also go far in helping retain the employee over time,” attorney adelson said. to learn more about restricted stock and restricted stock units, visit www.executiveemploymentattorney.com about

fighting liar with fire: ny attorney general schneiderman gets successfully sued % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) new york democrat attorney general eric schneiderman is the hack-est of hacks. a leftist ideologue to the point of derangement – and complete dereliction of his actual duty. rather than looking after the legal needs of the residents of the empire state, schneiderman has spent much of his time tilting at climate change windmills – embodied mostly by a years-long persecution of oil company exxonmobil. schneiderman has engaged in all of this nonsense as his part in a larger leftist campaign: “(t)wo rockefeller family foundations have been involved in an advocacy campaign that accuses exxonmobil of covering up what it knew about climate change….rockefeller foundations have funded journalism enterprises that have produced stories that overlap with the advocacy agenda….and this cavalcade of fake news served as the precursor to the new york state attorney general eric schneiderman-led years-long very real legal persecution of exxonmobil. which is simply the next phase of the rockefeller foundation’s calculated assault against exxonmobil. for having the audacity to engage in legal commerce – providing our nation a vital resource.” want some irony? this whole anti-exxon assault is allegedly predicated upon exxon “covering up what it knew about climate change.” so how hilarious is it – that

Article 1 - ovitz, hollywood giant of a few years ago, comes on hard times
what went wrong for mr. ovitz? according to rivals in talent management and to entertainment industry executives, mr. ovitz miscalculated the high rate of failure in the television business -- especially in today's shifting market, and spent huge amounts of money on deals and expenses without creating a sturdier foundation at the company. mr. ovitz has lost his powerful perch, at least for the moment, and over the years he has made numerous enemies who are almost eager to see him fail. no power broker in hollywood matches mr. ovitz for the number of powerful people -- whether it is michael d. eisner, the chairman of the walt disney company; david geffen, the entertainment industry billionaire; ron meyer, the president and chief operating officer of universal studios, or the partners at creative artists agency -- who actively dislike him. his financial straits are indeed embarrassing for mr. ovitz, a founder of the creative artists agency, less than a decade ago hollywood's most powerful talent agency. in recent years, he has suffered highly publicized blows -- including his dismissal after one year from the presidency of walt disney, even with a $100 million severance package. there have also been failed efforts to bring a professional football team back to los angeles and to become a broadway powerhouse by gaining control of the theatrical production company livent, but then asserting that the company was riddled with accounting fraud. the former executives of livent

Article 2 - for $600 a week, screen-side seats to lawsuit involving disney
the shareholder lawsuit over the $140 million severance package that the walt disney company paid to its former president, michael s. ovitz, is sure to be one of the most watched trials in recent hollywood history. for those who cannot afford to spend a month in georgetown, del., where the trial is set to begin next monday, chancellor william b. chandler iii of delaware chancery court has agreed that the proceedings can shown live over the internet at www.courtroomconnect.com. but access for business users comes at a price -- $600 a week for the audio and video as well as online access to documents and slides presented in court. louis goldberg, president of courtroom connect, said that reporters, lawyers and other interested parties would be able to watch live audio and video streaming of the testimony. the witness list includes michael d. eisner, the disney chief executive; george j. mitchell, the chairman; the dissident former directors stanley p. gold and roy e. disney, the nephew of the founder; and the former director and actor sydney poitier, who starred in ""to sir, with love."" advertisement continue reading the main story mr. ovitz is expected to be among the first witnesses, and the trial is sure to dredge up old information that is embarrassing to mr. eisner. some communications between mr. eisner and the board as well as documents related to mr

Article 3 - woody allen sues clothing maker
woody allen has sued a clothing maker and retailer, american apparel, for $10 million, saying it used his image without permission on billboards. last may, american apparel used an image of mr. allen from a film on billboards in new york and hollywood, he said in the complaint. mr. allen, 72, said that the use of his image was especially egregious because he does not endorse or sponsor any products in the united states. american apparel used his “image and identity in total disregard of his rights to privacy and publicity, his exclusive property rights and his personal rights,” mr. allen contends in the trademark suit, which was filed monday in federal district court in new york.

Article 4 - innocence besmirched
the worst of the hundred-acre wood is a few gorse prickles in the nose. but in the real world, considerably worse things abound, like fame and fortune. winnie the pooh and his friends are now, according to forbes magazine, the top-earning fictional characters on the planet, pulling in nearly $6 billion in worldwide retail sales annually. that's why lawyers have been fighting over them for 13 years -- until monday, in fact, when a judge in los angeles dismissed the case with prejudice. that case was a stuffed bear's nightmare, a battle over u.s. merchandising royalties between the walt disney company and the heirs of stephen slesinger, a literary agent who bought the marketing rights from pooh's creator, a. a. milne, in 1930. the plaintiffs claimed that disney had underpaid them to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. but both sides behaved badly in the course of the trial. disney was sanctioned $90,000 for illegally destroying 40 boxes of documents. the dismissal itself was brought on by the fact that the plaintiffs had obtained some of their evidence by rooting through disney dumpsters and then concealing its origins. ''willful, tactical, egregious and inexcusable'' were judge charles mccoy's words, and he wasn't talking about eeyore. it would be hard to say just who had pooh's interests at heart in this case, which was

Article 5 - metro business; suit against pop group
a former manager of the pop music quartet 98 degrees has filed a lawsuit accusing the group of firing him unjustly after he transformed them into pop stars. the suit, filed in federal district court in manhattan, said the musicians -- jeff timmons, nick lachey, drew lachey and justin jeffre -- breached their contract last year when they fired their manager, paris d'jon, and his company, top 40 entertainment. but john j. rosenberg, a lawyer for the musicians, said the group had adequate grounds to fire mr. d'jon and the management company he added that he planned to file a counter suit showing that the group's success had been ''achieved despite and not because of the efforts'' of mr. d'jon and top 40. benjamin weiser (nyt)

Article 7 - as a private lawyer, miers left little for the public record
most of the cases ms. miers handled were settled out of court, leaving little for the public record. according to the congressional research service, ms. miers has been counsel of record in 22 cases that were litigated. in 1975, she was the court-appointed counsel for a man seeking to overturn his 1960 conviction for transporting counterfeit securities across state lines. she lost that appeal. in 1981, ms. miers advocated on behalf of a woman seeking social security disability benefits. the court turned her down. in 2000, she successfully represented gov. george w. bush when a group of texas voters sued to block the state's electoral college representatives from voting for both mr. bush, then a presidential contender, and his vice presidential choice, dick cheney. but the majority of ms. miers's time as a lawyer with the dallas law firm locke liddell & sapp was spent counseling clients in business matters. she has represented the walt disney company and sungard in contract disputes, microsoft in a consumer class-action case, and investors in a real estate transaction that soured. in 1998, ms. miers represented disney enterprises in a dispute with esprit finance, which had entered into a contract to promote a disney concert tour in mexico. the financing fell through, and esprit sued disney in texas state court; disney lost and appealed, arguing that texas did not have jurisdiction over

Article 8 - bid to upend disney’s deal for maker studios falls short
bid to upend disney’s deal for maker studios falls short los angeles — an oddball maneuver by relativity media to break up the pending nuptials of the youtube-focused maker studios and the walt disney company ended on monday almost as fast as it started. relativity, a privately held midsize company with interests in film, music, television and sports, made it known late sunday night that it had submitted an offer of roughly $1 billion for maker, mostly in stock. disney, the world’s largest entertainment conglomerate, had announced a deal last month to acquire maker, a supplier of online video, for up to $950 million, mostly in cash. disney executives did little more than roll their eyes on monday, noting that the deal was sealed, and maker ultimately released a statement saying as much. “the agreement has been approved by maker studios’ board of directors and the majority of its shareholders and is expected to close in the next few weeks.” so relativity gets nothing – except for a publicity pop and new speculation in hollywood that it may again be considering an initial public offering. “we made a compelling offer and believe maker studios, its employees and its roster of talent would have greatly benefited from relativity’s platform,” relativity said in a statement in response to the maker statement. also on monday, a california judge rejected a legal effort by danny zappin, a maker founder, and three other individuals to block the sale of maker to

Title: ovitz defends his brief record at disney
Content: georgetown, del., oct. 28 - michael s. ovitz, the former president of the walt disney company testifying in a shareholder lawsuit here, spent thursday challenging accusations of conflicts of interest and failures during his brief tenure, lecturing on how hollywood worked. ""in our world people do things that are very unorthodox and that this court has not seen before,"" mr. ovitz said. but mr. ovitz's defense in chancery court did little to deter steven g. schulman, the lawyer for disney shareholders, who are suing over the board's handling of mr. ovitz's hiring in 1995 and the $140 million severance deal he got 14 months later. mr. schulman questioned whether mr. ovitz fully apprised disney executives of his continuing financial relationship with the creative artists agency, the talent agency he co-founded and later left for disney. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. schulman said mr. ovitz earned $27.9 million in 1996 from his ongoing relationship with creative artists, which was reorganized in 1995 when he joined disney.

the mindblog queue: moral responsibility; evolution of music; booze and hypnosis (before it's news) during this period of relative inactivity for mindblog, while i am pursuing other projects, i still accumulate references to work that looks interesting. rather than letting them disappear into the list of potential posts that has accumulated by now to 50 pages of links, i’m going to post some of the links, with minimal descriptions, to make it possible for readers who find a favorite topic to click their way to the source. did your brain make you do it? neuroscience and moral responsibility. “naïve dualism” is the belief that acts are brought about either by intentions or by the physical laws that govern our brains and that those two types of causes — psychological and biological — are categorically distinct. people are responsible for actions resulting from one but not the other. (in citing neuroscience, the supreme court may have been guilty of naïve dualism: did it really need brain evidence to conclude that adolescents are immature?)…naïve dualism is misguided. “was the cause psychological or biological?” is the wrong question when assigning responsibility for an action. all psychological states are also biological ones. a better question is “how strong was the relation between the cause (whatever it happened to be) and the effect?” if, hypothetically, only 1 percent of people with a brain malfunction (or a history of being abused) commit violence, ordinary considerations about blame would still seem

Article 2 - waking the sleeping giant – its again time america!
waking the sleeping giant – its again time america! (before it's news) an american tragedy – the sleeping giant must awaken by paul e. vallely many of us who were alive during world war ii and slightly thereafter may remember the famous quote regarding america being the “sleeping giant”. ‘be fearful of waking her!” do not wake a sleeping giant. this is an idiom which means: do not disturb/annoy/provoke someone powerful who was not disturbing you in the first place. japan woke a sleeping giant when they invaded pearl harbor. japanese admiral isoroku yamamoto is portrayed at the very end of the 1970 film “tora! tora! tora tora , and in the 2001 film _pearl harbor, as saying after his attack on _pearl harbor (film), “i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.” the quotation was abbreviated in the film _pearl harbor (2001), where it merely read, “i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant.” admiral isoroku yamamoto randall wallace, the screenwriter of pearl harbor, readily admitted that he copied the line from tora! tora! tora! the film’s producer, elmo williams, had found the line written in yamamoto’s diary. williams, in turn, has stated that larry forrester,

romney wordsworth – barack obama never seems to tire in devising new ways to demonstrate how much he hates america. this memorial day weekend, obama travelled to japan to attend a memorial service in the city of hiroshima. hiroshima, for those of you who don’t know history, was the japanese city that the united states dropped the first american atomic bomb on in a successful bid to bring world war ii to an end. while obama did not go so far as to issue a formal apology for america dropping an atomic bomb on hiroshima, as many feared he would, he did the next worse thing. when it came time for the miscreant to open his mouth, obama said he was observing in memorial an observance for all world war ii war dead! if that insult to u.s. servicemen isn’t immediately obvious to you, then allow me to spell it out for you: all war dead includes the japanese that bombed pearl harbor. all war dead includes the japanese army that carried out the rape of nanking. all war dead includes the japanese who forced american p.o.w.’s to do the bataan death march, and who tortured them as prisoners of war. it is a sad chapter in the history of the war that is today too often over-looked and white washed away. retired army staff sgt. lester tenney, 95, spent more than three years in japanese prison camps, and still has the

Article 1 - retired japanese fighter pilot sees an old danger on the horizon
it is a warning that mr. harada fears his countrymen may soon no longer be able to hear. there are only a dwindling number of japanese left who fought in the war, which in asia began when imperial japan invaded northeastern china in 1931, and claimed tens of millions of lives over the following 14 years. in an interview after his speech, mr. harada described himself as “the last zero fighter,” or at least the last pilot still alive who flew during that aircraft’s glory days early in the war with the united states. he recounted how in dogfights, he flew close enough to his opponents to see the terror on their faces as he sent them crashing to their deaths. photo “i fought the war from the cockpit of a zero, and can still remember the faces of those i killed,” said mr. harada, who said he was able to meet and befriend some of his foes who survived the war. “they were fathers and sons, too. i didn’t hate them or even know them.” “that is how war robs you of your humanity,” he added, “by putting you in a situation where you must either kill perfect strangers or be killed by them.” mr. harada said that as he and other aging veterans pass from the scene, japan will lose more than just their war stories. he said it was his generation’s bitter experiences, and resulting aversion to war, that have kept japan firmly on a pacifist

Article 2 - official quits in japan after article on mob ties
tokyo — japan’s justice minister resigned on tuesday after an uproar over his past ties to members of organized crime, putting further pressure on prime minister yoshihiko noda to call national elections. the minister, keishu tanaka, appointed three weeks ago in a cabinet reshuffle, resigned for health reasons, the government’s top spokesman, osamu fujimura, said at a news conference on tuesday. but the resignation came after days of haranguing from opposition lawmakers over a magazine report that said he had associated with a japanese organized-crime syndicate. mr. tanaka acknowledged that he had helped with the wedding of an organized-crime member three decades ago and that he had attended a party hosted by a mobster boss. but he initially refused to resign, saying he had been unaware of their mob connections at the time. photo mr. tanaka had also been accused of accepting political donations from a foreign resident in japan, in violation of japanese law. amid the mounting accusations, he checked into a tokyo hospital on friday, complaining of chest pains, according to local media reports. he was discharged on monday. advertisement continue reading the main story connections between japan’s notorious gangsters and parts of japan’s political and business elite were not uncommon in the past, though a recent crackdown on organized crime has made such links far riskier.

Article 4 - remembering hiroshima, and how it changed the world
after 70 years, the memory may be fading. survivors are in their 80s, and many young japanese can no longer give the dates when american atomic bombs incinerated hiroshima and nagasaki. but at every anniversary the debates resurface, as impassioned and complex as ever. there is no disputing the awesome brutality of the two bombs that killed more than 200,000 in the two cities in august 1945, most of them civilians and many in unspeakable agony. nor is there any question that the bombs opened an era in which the very survival of the human race became hostage to geopolitical disputes. the questions that remain, and can never be resolved, are whether the bombings were necessary or moral. hiroshima and nagasaki have become shrines to peace and a pacifism proclaiming that nuclear weapons are an absolute evil. tens of thousands of people joined japanese prime minister shinzo abe and the united states ambassador to japan, caroline kennedy, in hiroshima on thursday to mark the anniversary of the moment when a bomb nicknamed little boy exploded over the city. photo the commemorations, with their annual calls for nuclear disarmament, can seem placid and unambiguous. but the narrative and the politics under that surface are turbulent still. the pacific war, japan’s culpability and the bombings animate mr. abe’s politics. he has alarmed pacifist japanese with his drive to lift some postwar restrictions on japan’s

“it was a story he always told us,” his daughter, ann yoshida, said in an interview on tuesday. “it was a moment of tremendous conflict for him.” japanese aliens, known as issei, as well as japanese-americans born in the united states, referred to as nisei, were removed from the west coast of the united states as supposed security threats in the war’s early stages and sent to remote internment camps, most of them inland, where they were placed under guard. dr. yoshida had cousins in california who were interned at a camp in the state. but he volunteered for army service and in march 1943 joined the newly formed 442nd regimental combat team, a japanese-american unit remembered today for extraordinary bravery in fighting the germans in italy and france. he was wounded during the italian campaign and, in separate engagements, received a silver star and a bronze star for bravery under fire. photo through the course of a long life, dr. yoshida became a surgeon and practiced in hawaii for 35 years. although he joined the army when he was nearly 31, he outlived all seven japanese-american veterans who were still alive in 2000 when they were among a group of 22 asian-americans awarded the medal of honor by president bill clinton for valor during world war ii. they had previously been denied it, presumably because of prejudice. “he was very pleased

today, at his home in neighboring takarazuka city, keiichi yamashita, 39, received the body of his 8-year-old daughter, rena, who was killed in the attack. ''schools are supposed to be safe. i didn't expect that she would suffer a tragedy like this,'' mr. yamashita said in an interview with the mainichi shimbun newspaper. several parents, who attended the school meeting today, said that their children were still nervous about the assault and did not want to return to the school, which officials said would remain closed until the middle of next week. the brutal attack at ikeda is being viewed in vastly different ways in japan. for many japanese, the attack is the latest manifestation that violence is raging out of control in what was once a virtually crime-free society. for others, the episode underscored either the lack of security at japanese schools or the government's failure to address the growing problem of mental illness. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. some japanese blamed the stabbing on the country's economic woes, which has caused increased unemployment. and for

Article 8 - ‘in praise of forgetting,’ by david rieff
instead, he warns that all too often, collective memory “has led to war rather than peace . . . and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness.” for rieff, national remembrances are almost always political, sometimes imposed by victorious armies, at other times drummed up by manipulative politicians seeking to fabricate an epic past to legitimize their present-day intentions. he provides a depressing abundance of examples where toxic memories fuel atavistic hatred: among iraqis; israelis and palestinians; radical islamists across the globe; and hindu chauvinists rallied by the indian prime minister, narendra modi. this is no abstract dread for rieff, a distinguished journalist known for eviscerating american and european failures in bosnia and later for thoughtfully questioning the value of international humanitarian organizations. having been an eyewitness to yugoslavia’s collapse, he understands the grotesque realities of ethnic strife and power politics with stark clarity. he disgustedly recalls visiting a serb nationalist politician in belgrade who, as the war raged in bosnia, venerated the serbian guerrillas of world war ii, while one of his aides portentously handed rieff a piece of paper reading “1453” — the year when the ottoman empire conquered orthodox constantinople. worse, rieff worries that memory could not just spark violence, but prolong it. in order to end

Content: last to surrender-no honor, just terror, now he is dead (before it's news) by major van harl usaf ret last to surrender-no honor just terror now he is dead ammoland gun news wisconsin --(ammoland.com)- the history channel ran a documentary about ww ii, japanese army 2nd lieutenant hiroo onoda. he was the japanese solider who spent 30 years hiding in the hills of the philippine island, of lubang. he was a 23-year-old officer who had been trained in guerrilla warfare. his first combat assignment was in december of 1944 to lubang island. this was not some combat seasoned japanese army officer who had spent years fighting the war. this was by his own admission a young man who had problems with authority figures and following the rules. however if the orders were to his liking, he was fanatical about blindly following rules. when the second world war ended, because no one sat onoda down and explained the fighting had officially stopped, onoda took it upon himself to continue the struggle. he started out with three other japanese soldiers. one ran away and surrendered after almost five years of living in the jungle. the other two were killed in firefights with filipinos. in some of the more politely written information i found, onoda lived on coconuts & bananas and he killed an occasional filipino cow. what he really did was develop a thirty-year reign of terror on the inhabitants of lubang island. he raided the local villages, stealing what he could carry off and burning what he could not. he kept this up even after he was the last of the four japanese, left on the island. it is believed he killed between 30 and 50 local filipinos and wounded up to 100. one filipino tells how his brother was shot while gathering coconuts up in a tree. after the man fell to the ground onoda hacked him to death. he finally gave it up in 1974 after his old army commander came to the jungle and read an order for onoda to surrender. this way, onoda did not have to take the personal responsibility for his actions. someone else made him give up. he stated “i have never regretted anything i have done,” apparently to include the killing of up to 50 innocent civilian filipinos. of course onoda was part of the army of japan that brutally invaded and occupied the philippines. now having president ferdinand marcos of the philippines pardon onoda right a way, for the sake of relations with japan (read money), went a long way to excuse the atrocities of onoda. onoda lived on a cattle ranch in brazil. he believes japan is a puppet-state and their current constitution was forced onto that nation at gunpoint. hiroo onoda you know what, it probably was and there are good reasons for that? approximately one third of the us

school district in north carolina accused of discrimination % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) a north carolina school district has been accused of discriminating against latino students, and formal complaint has been filed with the u.s. department of education. the complaint, filed by the southern poverty law center (splc), followed a letter sent to durham public schools from the center. the letter stated that latino students do not “feel welcome” in dps, which is around 20 percent latino. when the center received a “vague” and seemingly uncaring response from dps it countered by contacting federal officials. though based in montgomery, alabama, the splc filed suit on behalf of durham school district’s more than 6,000 students and families with limited english proficiency. splc said that in one instance, a teacher at durham’s northern high school slammed a latino student against the wall and told the student, “go back to your own country.” the center also said another teacher fired a racial slur at a latino student. the district is also being scolded for having only three spanish-language interpreters. pilar rocha, director of durham’s largest immigrant organization, el centro hispano, said she is not surprised that the district is under investigation for discrimination, considering the number of complaints she’s heard from the parents of the schools’ students. published in educacion read more at hispanically speaking

career politician huppenthal struggles for survival % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) huppenthal’s reprehensible attempts to rehab career fail miserably john huppenthal is far more than a statewide politician who has repeatedly used abysmal judgment. who can forget his tearful admission of guilt acknowledging himself as the anonymous commenter on numerous blogs —- including this one —- with many of his postings done during work hours? imagine the state superintendent of public instruction characterizing the poor as “lazy pigs” and labeling critics as “barbarians” and “evil scum.” there was also that embarrassing physical confrontation with an elderly woman on election day in 2008. that’s john huppenthal. huppenthal, who claimed conservative credentials as a candidate, revealed his true bent as he cozied up to obama’s education point man arne duncan. huppenthal used this media advisory to brag about hosting duncan around the state of arizona. alarmed by the voices of angry voters, parents dedicated to protecting their children and facing diane douglas, a knowledgeable conservative challenger, john huppenthal decided the most advantageous scheme was to try to dupe the public by slickly colluding with gov. jan brewer to alter the tarnished name of “common core,” transforming it to “arizona college and career ready standards,“ after admitting the original name had become “politically charged.” even with the deceptive

Article 5 - school choice lawsuit roundup
school choice lawsuit roundup (before it's news) jason bedrick school choice advocates have been winning in the halls of state legislatures and in the court of public opinion, so opponents have taken to the courts of law. since the u.s. supreme court ruled in zelman v. simmons-harris (2002) that school vouchers are consistent with the first amendment’s establishment clause, opponents of choice have been scrambling to find novel reasons to challenge school choice programs. here’s a brief summary of school choice lawsuits around the nation: 1) in louisiana, the u.s. department of justice has sued to halt the state’s school voucher program, arguing that it hurts the desegregation effort. the doj’s already weak case was further undermined by a new study released today showing that school choice actually improves integration. since 90 percent of the voucher recipients are black, the doj’s lawsuit would have the effect of keeping low-income blacks from attending the schools of their choice. earlier this year, louisiana’s state supreme court ruled that the voucher program was unconstitutionally funded, but otherwise left the program intact. the governor and state legislators adjusted the funding mechanism in response. 2) two days ago, a group of activists in oklahoma sued the state over its special needs voucher program, arguing that it violates the state constitution’s ban on using public funds at religious schools. last year, the state supreme court tossed out a challenge to the program by public school districts,

Article 6 - charlotte iserbyt -- parent-teacher-student manifesto
parent/teacher/student manifesto by charlotte iserbyt march 15, 2014 newswithviews.com thank you, reed hastings. are you by chance a mole in the trotskyites' (heritage, et al, neoconservatives “stop common core” bandwagon designed to divert the american people's attention from the key issue, tax-funded school choice with no elected boards?) how exquisitely brilliant is this highly-funded anti-communist core (bad as cc is) diversion! why are you, mr. hastings, now blowing the whistle on your friends? (by the way, how many americans are aware that the heritage foundation which is leading the parent bandwagon in opposition to the cc standards is at the same time leading the tax-funded school choice bandwagon? do they know that the heritage foundation drafted the north american free trade agreement (nafta) which has robbed americans of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, and which calls for tax-funded school choice for workforce training?) the anti-common core diversion has succeeded in keeping americans from focusing on the real issue - the trojan horse - loss of elected representation through publicly-funded school choice and charters with unelected councils (soviet form of government/regionalism). note: some charter schools are teaching religion. isn’t that unconstitutional? do americans really want to pay their education taxes to have a charter school teach religious beliefs? and not even have an elected official to whom they

Article 7 - despite house action, debate over ‘no child left behind’ goes nowhere
despite house action, debate over ‘no child left behind’ goes nowhere (before it's news) after years of inaction on rewriting the nation’s centerpiece legislation governing public schools, the republican-controlled house of representatives on friday passed “the student success act” by a mostly partisan vote of 221-207 – despite a veto threat from the white house. contrary to the legislation’s grandiose title, very little in the bill directly addresses the needs of students at all – other than some provisions related to homeless students and schools affected by the presence of the federal government. and nowhere does it propose what “success” for the nation’s students should look like and how our country can know when we’re realizing success for more of our youngest citizens. the bill is being peddled by republicans as “a better approach to k-12 education,” but many of the provisions continue the current emphasis on using high-stakes testing to evaluate teachers and to grade schools. as has been the tendency in education policy, the emphasis on raising test scores is generously seasoned with the language of “effectiveness,” while none of the policy directly addresses what effective teachers and schools actually do and how that can be supported, sustained and spread. the bill’s emphasis on assessment is never balanced with attention to curriculum and instruction, as if the stern hand of accountability will magically take care of all the other aspects of schooling that are necessary for real success. a teacher’s ability “to teach” is assumed to be wholly and

Article 2 - taxpayers will defend trump in suit charging constitutional violations
before his inauguration, lawyers hired by mr. trump argued that the clause “does not forbid fair-market-value transactions with foreign officials,” like paying for hotel rooms. they also said mr. trump would donate profits from foreign governments’ patronage to the united states treasury. but the lawsuit, filed by citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a liberal government corruption watchdog, contends that the clause bars such transactions, too, and that donating profits does not solve the problem. it wants the judge to stop mr. trump’s businesses from accepting such payments. it is not clear that judge abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause’s meaning. first, she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge. the group argued that it had standing to sue because keeping track of foreign payments to mr. trump’s businesses imposed a “significant diversion and depletion of its time, resources and effort.” it cited a 1982 housing discrimination case as precedent for the idea that an advocacy organization can sue over conduct that drains its resources. but several scholars on monday noted that congress had enacted a statute that made it easier to challenge housing discrimination, but not emoluments clause violations. josh blackman, a conservative law professor at south texas college of law houston, argued in a lengthy blog entry that a “self-inflicted” injury – like choosing to track certain conduct – is generally not sufficient to establish court standing. ouch. trump’s d.c. hotel is losing money. the

Both summaries mention NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) making a finding about aftershocks of flares, which is accurately reported in the article. Additionally, both summaries discuss the effects of extreme ultraviolet radiation on Earth's upper atmosphere, including heating and ionizing it, accelerating satellite decay, and disrupting GPS signals. The only minor discrepancy lies in the specific details regarding the late phase flare, but overall, the reliable news summary provides a comprehensive overview of the topic without introducing unsubstantiated claims or sensationalist language characteristic of fake news summaries.","Recent solar activity has been increasing, with intense bursts of radiation and magnetic energy associated with sunspots. X-class solar flares have occurred, potentially producing coronal mass ejections (CMEs) aimed at Earth. The geomagnetic field is expected to be affected, causing elevated conditions.

Massive sunquakes can be triggered by solar eruptions, including CMEs. A large sunspot, AR1476, is intensifying with M-class flares and may produce X-class flares. The sun's magnetic field is crucial in understanding these events.

Geomagnetic storms are predicted, with a 55% chance of M-class flares from the current sunspots. The solar wind speed is increasing, causing concern for Earth's polar caps. Scientists are monitoring the situation to provide warnings and guidance.

The effects of solar activity on Earth-orbiting satellites and communication systems have been noted. Animal deaths have been reported globally, with diverse species affected. Researchers are exploring possible causes, including magnetic changes.

Recent data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has provided insights into the sun's behavior. The SDO has observed intense magnetic fields driving gas into the stellar surface, heating large areas to millions of degrees.","Scientists have made several discoveries related to the sun and space. A solar astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center stated that some of the biggest solar storms in history occurred on the downward side of the solar cycle, and even weak cycles can generate ferocious outbursts. Researchers are still learning about the sun due to the current maximum.

A rare ""ring of fire"" eclipse was visible in parts of South America and Africa, where the moon moved between the earth and the sun, briefly replacing it with a blazing ring. This event is caused by the moon's elliptical nature around the earth.

NASA researchers have found that Saturn's north polar region has changed color over the past four years. The hexagonal north polar region appears bluish in some images and more golden in others. Scientists theorize that this change could be due to increased exposure to sunlight or atmospheric circulation.

the september 2015 wave x awakening (before it's news) by dr. kathy j. forti, i once had a media and communications professor ask a packed auditorium of journalism students the interesting question: “what is the singular factor that affects all of humanity? a factor that can start or stop wars? that can raise up civilizations or destroy them?” not one student could come up with the right, yet so obvious, answer: space weather. almost 35+ years later, i still remember his words. when i heard dr. simon atkins recently talk about the ‘”wave x shift of 2015″ it made complete sense. atkins is a well-known climate risk economist and planetary threat forecaster with a doctorate in biometeo-electromagnetics. he uses the science of magnetism to bring clarity to what is presently occurring in our world. space weather not only influences, but guides humanity. statistics show that when there are intense solar flares from space, 82% of the time there is a downshift in the stock market 1-3 days later. these same solar flare peaks are known to cause eruptions of violence between classes (sort of like the full moon effect). it’s a natural phenomenon, but its all due to magnetic waves that ultimately affect every living organism on our planet. on a positive note, when there are coronal mass ejections from the sun (cmes), humans are more likely to experience euphoria

huge sunquakes triggered by solar eruptions % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) [topic]massive bursts of solar wind and magnetic fields from the sun can cause huge sunquakes, according to new uk research. the results of the study, led by university college london’s mullard space science laboratory, are being presented by dr sergei zharkovat at the national astronomy meeting 2012 in manchester on friday, march 30. research over the last 10 years has shown that sunquakes can be produced when solar flares—huge explosions of energy in the sun’s atmosphere—impact and travel into the sun. the quakes appear as circular ripples on the surface of the sun. the new study shows that eruptions of charged particles and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections (cmes) are also able to produce sunquakes. “sunquakes are generated by solar flares, when enormous amounts of energy are released high up in the solar atmosphere. most of the energy goes up into interplanetary space, but a fraction of this energy travels to the sun’s surface creating a sonic boom that causes the solar interior to oscillate and produce the ripples,” explained zharkov in an email. “i sometimes think of sunquakes as thunder to the flare’s lightning, except imagine a lightning over an ocean that is so strong that it creates a tsunami.” the

Article 1 - a solar show with mixed reviews
“i think the general consensus is that we’ve passed the peak,” said c. alex young, a solar astrophysicist at nasa’s goddard space flight center in greenbelt, md. but he added that some of the biggest solar storms in history occurred on the downward side of the solar cycle, and even a weak cycle can generate ferocious outbursts. “i think the expectation right now is we might see another burst of this activity five or six months from now,” dr. young said. “we might still have some big events.” perhaps more than anything else, the current maximum has taught solar scientists that they have a lot more to learn about the sun. in 2006, at the end of the previous solar cycle, mausumi dikpati, a scientist at the national center for atmospheric research in boulder, colo., undertook an ambitious endeavor — a computer model using the basic physics of the sun to forecast what would happen next. her model made two main predictions: the cycle would start slowly, and it would be a big one, one-third to one-half stronger than the last one. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred.

Article 2 - ‘ring of fire’ eclipse travels across south america and africa
slide show people in parts of south america and africa were treated to a rare sight on sunday: a “ring of fire” eclipse, when the moon moves in between the earth and the sun, briefly replacing it with a blazing, fiery ring. an event of this kind — technically called an annular eclipse — is a byproduct of the moon’s elliptical nature around the earth, which means it is sometimes further away from the planet than at other times. an annular eclipse is one that happens when the moon is unable to completely block our view of the sun because it is at one of its greater distances from earth. the countries with the best chance of viewing an annular eclipse are those that lie along the path of annularity, an invisible line that traces the path taken by the moon’s shadow as it moves across the globe, according to c. alex young, a solar astrophysicist from nasa. they include chile and argentina in south america and angola, zambia and the democratic republic of congo in africa, where viewers were able to see the full “ring of fire” effect for roughly one minute. skywatchers on the ground in those countries — including more than a few government agencies — live-tweeted their experience on sunday, with some complaining that overcast weather dampened their views. people outside the direct path of annularity could still get a glimpse of the show although it was only be a partial eclipse. for everyone else, there is

Article 3 - images show that saturn's north polar region has changed color
nasa researchers are trying to figure out why saturn’s hexagonal north polar region has changed color over the past four years. saturn’s hexagon is a six-sided jet stream barrier, according to scientists, who have proposed various theories to explain its shape . in one image nasa shared, from 2012, the hexagon appears to be bluish. but in another photo taken four years later, it looks golden. nasa images of saturn's north polar hexagon, which appears bluish in 2012 and more golden in 2016. saturn’s changing seasons and increased exposure to sunlight might have caused the color change, scientists theorize. “during the polar winter night between november 1995 and august 2009, saturn’s north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions ― reactions involving sunlight and the atmosphere,” nasa explained on its website. “since the planet experienced equinox in august 2009, the polar atmosphere has been basking in continuous sunshine, and aerosols are being produced inside of the hexagon, around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy today,” the website stated. atmospheric circulation could also explain the color change. both images were obtained by nasa’s cassini spacecraft , which launched in 1997 and orbits saturn, studying the planet and its moons. also on huffpost more: nasa saturn suggest a correction 8.37 m 8.08 m 452

Article 4 - nasa launches an orbiting mystery-solver
not only are gamma rays invisible, however, but they do not penetrate the atmosphere, and thus astronomers have had to go to space to discover and study them. among the surprises found by previous satellites was that the heavens were dotted with powerful bursts lasting only a few seconds and never reappearing. chasing down these gamma ray bursts, which have been linked in some cases to the implosions of very massive stars into black holes, has become a major field of space astronomy. a survey of the sky in the 1990s by the compton gamma ray observatory, now defunct, found 271 more-permanent sources of celestial gamma radiation. some of them turned out to be quasars and pulsars, but more than two-thirds of them have never been identified. the new observatory, the largest and most sensitive yet, has two components. the first, known as the large area telescope, consists of 16 stacks with interleaved layers of silicon and tungsten that will record the direction, energy and time of arrival of each gamma ray that hits it. (because of their high energy, gamma rays behave in many ways more like a rain of discrete particles — photons — than waves.) newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services.

Article 5 - museum tunes in as the world churns
for up-to-the-minute news of earth-shaking events, the best place to go in new york is the american museum of natural history. since june 23, the new seismography exhibit has been flashing and twitching every time there has been earthquake activity around the world. the earthquake station is on the first floor of the gottesman hall of planet earth, in the rose center for earth and space. fortunately, earthquakes severe enough to make news are not daily events. but the exhibit shows just how jumpy the planet is. ''one of the points that this display makes is that earthquakes occur all the time,'' said dr. edmond a. mathez, a museum curator. a large monitor contains real-time indicators of the location and severity of earthquakes. rings of various diameters and colors (red for a quake that day, orange for one the day before, yellow for any in the last two weeks) show which areas are experiencing temblors. anyone thinking of buying real estate on the west coast, which was practically blotted out on the screen by yellow rings one day recently, may want to visit this exhibit first. for new yorkers, though, the exhibit provides some comfort: as nerve-jangling as life in the city can be, on the larger screen, it was a near-colorless place. another video monitor contains a readout of each earthquake's geographic coordinates and severity, and is updated every 10 minutes.

Article 6 - earthlike planets may be merely an illusion
in 2010, astronomers were stirred by the discovery of gliese 581g, a distant earthlike planet that orbited its star just closely enough to allow for surface water, and possibly life. but the planet’s existence was almost immediately called into question, with some researchers unable to locate it. now, a team at penn state is saying that gliese 581g and a presumed neighbor planet, gliese 581d, were simply illusions caused by the star they supposedly orbited. by measuring hydrogen atoms in the atmosphere of that star (gliese 581), the researchers found that signals originally thought to be coming from planets were actually false positives caused by intense stellar magnetic activity, like sunspots. such activity can sometimes stimulate the emission of hydrogen. but all is not lost, said the study’s lead author, paul robertson, an astronomer at penn state. correcting for the magnetic activity also increased the signals for other planets long thought to orbit gliese 581. “we found evidence for stellar noise in the data that has been published previously, and when we corrected for that, we got this really nice dichotomy,” he said. “the real planets and their signals get much stronger, but these planets d and g, their signals disappeared.” though their findings, which were published in the journal science, may represent the end of the road for gliese 581g, it could yield a useful new method for identifying planets. “i’m hoping that this will provide a

Article 8 - nasa discovers mysterious electron superhighway above earth
some electrons are speeding above earth's surface at nearly the speed of light, and nasa isn't sure why. according to a new study, the tiny, charged particles were found accelerating to high speeds in an unexpected part of space, farther from earth than previously realized. the region these fast electrons were found in, known as the foreshock, is the part of the solar system where charged particles streaming from the sun are thought to be reflected back from earth's magnetic field toward the star. see also: nasa is firing lasers on mars — here’s why until now, however, scientists didn't think the region could speed up particles to the degree that was observed “this is a puzzling case because we’re seeing energetic electrons where we don’t think they should be, and no model fits them,” david sibeck, a co-author of the new study published in the journal physical review letters said in a statement . “there is a gap in our knowledge, something basic is missing,” sibeck said. the study evaluated data from a nasa program known as themis — a mission involving five identical space probes tasked with studying earth’s auroras and the radiation environment around our planet. human space travel implications charged particles streaming from the sun out into the rest of the solar system can harm satellites in orbit and even people living in space. that radiation needs to be understood in order to guard against its worst effects. “this affects pretty much every field that deals with high-energy particles,

Title: solar watch: a tale of 4 coronal mass ejections
Content: new findings on flares: nasa’s solar dynamics observatory (sdo), launched in february 2010, made the finding: about 1 in 7 flares experience an “aftershock.” about ninety minutes after the flare dies down, it springs to life again, producing an extra surge of extreme ultraviolet radiation. “we call it the ‘late phase flare,’” says woods. “the energy in the late phase can exceed the energy of the primary flare by as much as a factor of four.” what causes the late phase? solar flares happen when the magnetic fields of sunspots erupt—a process called “magnetic reconnection.” the late phase is thought to result when some of the sunspot’s magnetic loops re-form. a diagram prepared by team member rachel hock of the university of colorado shows how it works. the extra energy from the late phase can have a big effect on earth. extreme ultraviolet wavelengths are particularly good at heating and ionizing earth’s upper atmosphere. when our planet’s atmosphere is heated by extreme uv radiation, it puffs up, accelerating the decay of low-orbiting satellites. furthermore, the ionizing action of extreme uv can bend radio signals and disrupt the normal operation of gps. -

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Scientists have made several discoveries related to the sun and space. A solar astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center stated that some of the biggest solar storms in history occurred on the downward side of the solar cycle, and even weak cycles can generate ferocious outbursts. Researchers are still learning about the sun due to the current maximum.

A rare ""ring of fire"" eclipse was visible in parts of South America and Africa, where the moon moved between the earth and the sun, briefly replacing it with a blazing ring. This event is caused by the moon's elliptical nature around the earth.

NASA researchers have found that Saturn's north polar region has changed color over the past four years. The hexagonal north polar region appears bluish in some images and more golden in others. Scientists theorize that this change could be due to increased exposure to sunlight or atmospheric circulation.

A new observatory, the largest and most sensitive yet, is being launched to study gamma rays. Gamma ray bursts are powerful events caused by massive stars collapsing into black holes. The new observatory will record the direction, energy, and time of arrival of each gamma ray that hits it.

The American Museum of Natural History has a seismography exhibit that flashes and twitches every time there is earthquake activity around the world. This display shows how jumpy the planet is and provides real-time indicators of the location and severity of earthquakes.

Astronomers have discovered that some ""earthlike"" planets

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Recent solar activity has been increasing, with intense bursts of radiation and magnetic energy associated with sunspots. X-class solar flares have occurred, potentially producing coronal mass ejections (CMEs) aimed at Earth. The geomagnetic field is expected to be affected, causing elevated conditions.

Massive sunquakes can be triggered by solar eruptions, including CMEs. A large sunspot, AR1476, is intensifying with M-class flares and may produce X-class flares. The sun's magnetic field is crucial in understanding these events.

Geomagnetic storms are predicted, with a 55% chance of M-class flares from the current sunspots. The solar wind speed is increasing, causing concern for Earth's polar caps. Scientists are monitoring the situation to provide warnings and guidance.

The effects of solar activity on Earth-orbiting satellites and communication systems have been noted. Animal deaths have been reported globally, with diverse species affected. Researchers are exploring possible causes, including magnetic changes.

Recent data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has provided insights into the sun's behavior. The SDO has observed intense magnetic fields driving gas into the stellar surface, heating large areas to millions of degrees.

Analysts expect UPS earnings to be $1.05 per share on $13.17 in revenues, with guidance for the fourth quarter being $1.25 per share on $14.46 in revenues. FedEx announced plans to hire 20,000 additional seasonal workers, indicating a healthier-than-expected economy.

US Treasuries rallied as weak economic data suggested a loss of momentum in recovery. Personal income and personal spending failed to grow in June, while factory orders unexpectedly dropped by 1.2%. Pending home sales also declined 2.6% on a month-over-month basis.

The US unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%, with some banks expecting a modest drag from winter storms around the December survey period. The ISM manufacturing index rose to 53.2, while China's non-manufacturing PMI advanced to 55.0.

Economic data releases suggest that the US recovery may be slowing as it heads into the second half of 2010. The Commerce Department released figures showing personal income and personal spending failed to grow in June, following a downward revision in May readings.","The US economy showed signs of growth in March, with service companies expanding at a healthy pace and stepping up hiring. The Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing activity dropped to 56, indicating expansion, while the ADP survey reported 209,000 private sector jobs added in March.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.27 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,066.96, with the Nasdaq adding 6.71 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,886.94. The labor department reported a sharp decline in applications for unemployment benefits, falling to 268,000.

The Consumer Confidence Index fell in October, with consumers expecting little growth and no recession. Average hourly wages rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 percent, while productivity remained unchanged.

The jobs report is expected to show a pickup in hiring from last month, with economists forecasting 175,000 nonfarm payrolls and an unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent. However, some experts caution that the pace of hiring may slow down due to signs of economic slowing.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a survey of 144,000 employers, but sampling error remains a concern. The number of people out of work for more than six months eased to 5.8 million, its lowest level since October 2009.

(before it's news) by bondsquawk: u.s. treasuries rallied and stocks fell as weak economic data suggested a loss of momentum in recovery. stocks pared some of its gains from yesterday while treasuries more than made up for its losses. economic data today’s economic data releases suggest that the u.s. recovery may be slowing as we head into the second half of 2010. the commerce department released figures that both personal income and personal spending failed to grow in june, following a tenth of a percent downward revision in the may readings to final levels of 0.3 and 0.1 percent, respectively. june’s flat readings disappointed economists as surveys called for an increase of 0.2 percent in personal income and a move higher of 0.1 percent in personal spending. factory orders unexpectedly dropped in june giving more reason of a slowdown in manufacturing activity, according to the u.s. department of commerce. factory orders fell by 1.2 percent versus surveys of a decline of 0.5 percent. to add insult to injury to the disappointment of missing expectations, the prior period’s reading was revised downward from an initial release of -1.4 percent to a final -1.8 percent. pending home sales dropped 2.6 percent on a month over month basis in june as government tax incentives expired for prospective home buyers.

Article 6 - rick davis’ must read american consumer review
(before it's news) after having highlighted rick davis’ work at consumer metrics institute in my morning commentary, i reached out to him and received the following must read fabulous response. if you care to truly learn what is going on with the american consumer as we collectively navigate the economic landscape, sit down, take notes, save this review, and share it with your friends. in terms of cutting edge, real time, unbiased economic analysis and commentary it does not get better than this. thank you, rick!! we go to great lengths to remove from our data both the inexorable shift of consumers from brick-and-mortar to on-line and the impact of price inflation. we use “same shopper” metrics to neutralize that effect, and the data just released merely documents the ongoing cannibalization of brick-and-mortar sales by newly emboldened web users. but that traffic has been much more “feel good” spending than the “quality” spending necessary to stimulate the economy through the purchase of discretionary durable goods from expanding real income (or even expanding credit) — as reflected in our daily growth index or weighted composite index. as an example, since november we have registered substantially higher traffic at the on-line portals for the major mall-based department store chains, which corroborates the data in the nominally-priced ft report to a large extent. we continue to believe that (ft report notwithstanding), u.s. consumers are still very cautious about major spending. in fact my next commentary will start

Article 1 - service jobs increased in march, data shows
washington (ap) — service companies continued to expand at a healthy pace last month and stepped up hiring, providing more evidence that the american economy was growing and adding jobs. the institute for supply management said wednesday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity dropped to 56 in march, from its 12-month high of 57.3 in february. any reading above 50 indicates expansion. economists said the slight decline was not troubling because the reading was still at a healthy level that points to growth. and a measure of employment rose to near a six-year high reached in january. i.s.m., a trade group of purchasing managers, surveys roughly 90 percent of american companies in all sectors outside of manufacturing. that includes retail, construction, financial services, health care and hotels. advertisement continue reading the main story separately, the payroll processor adp said the economy added 209,000 private sector jobs in march. the job gains in january and february were also revised up. the adp survey does not include government jobs.

Article 4 - how to make jobs disappear
photo at precisely 8:30 a.m. on the first friday of the month, thousands of people (including me) stare at a dull government web site and hit refresh until they see the number: how many jobs were created or lost during the previous month. then, with amazing speed, reports and analysis of the number are disseminated by newspapers, bank economists, independent analysts, investment newsletters and countless tv pundits. within minutes, the national narrative is set. either the economy is doing far worse (like last month) or far better (as in january) than anyone realized. the jobs number, which only the most die-hard econonerds (including me) used to care about, is supposed to tell us how the economy is doing. now, though, it is doing something much more complicated. the report on past job performance has morphed into a driver of future job performance, essentially mucking up the thing it’s measuring. and that’s not good, because the initial jobs data are not as precise as many people seem to think. take the most recent report. after it was announced that only about 69,000 jobs were created during may — and that the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 8.2 percent — some observers who had expressed cautious optimism as recently as 8:29 a.m. were instantly transformed into grim cassandras. all at once, it seemed, everyone agreed that president obama’s re-election chances had taken a serious hit and the

Article 6 - how not to be misled by the jobs report
human beings, unfortunately, are bad at perceiving randomness. if you go to a baseball game and watch a commanding performance by your team, it tells you very nearly nothing about how the team will perform over the course of a season. similarly, one month of jobs numbers doesn’t tell you much of anything about how the economy is actually doing. none of this is meant to cast aspersions on the bureau of labor statistics, the arm of the labor department that faces the unenviable task of trying to discern how many jobs there are in the united states each month. the bureau does so by conducting an enormous survey of 144,000 employers who together employ about a third of all nonagricultural workers. it is one of the most important economic data releases, in no small part because it comes out quickly; results from a survey the bureau took in the middle of last month, for example, will be released on friday, before almost any other data about the april economy is available. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. even with all those survey participants, there is sampling error; the employers responding to the survey might be

Article 7 - payrolls show strong growth but jobless rate rises
“this is very encouraging for the sustainability of the recovery,” said james f. o’sullivan, chief economist at mf global . another brighter sign was among the long-term unemployed. the number of people out of work for more than six months eased to 5.8 million, its lowest level since october 2009. still, 13.7 million people remained without work and were still looking. earlier in the week, a number of reports indicated that the economy had stumbled in the days since the labor department compiled its survey. the biggest worry was a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance , and a survey of companies showed a slowdown in new orders and hiring. bernard baumohl, chief global economist with the economic outlook group, has spent most of the last year as a strong optimist, but sounds increasingly cautious. “there are just too many economic indicators that point to an economy that has been slowing,” said mr. baumohl, noting last week’s report that output slumped to 1.8 percent in the first quarter of the year. “it almost looks like a bull that’s charging through a crowd, utterly impervious to what’s in front of it. “regretfully, i think the pace of hiring will slow down in may and june,” he added. “i think in this case the job market is a lagging indicator, and i think it will probably fall off as well, as more signs point to a weakening economy.”

Title: listening to the people who purchase
Content: the monthly employment report is probably the biggest item on the economic calendar this week, but robert macintosh, chief economist at the fund manager eaton vance, will be casting his eye elsewhere. he contends that two surveys of corporate purchasing managers provide a truer assessment of the state of the economy. on monday, the institute of supply management will issue its report on the first of those surveys, on manufacturing activity for september. a bloomberg news poll of economists forecasts a decline to 53.5 from 54.5 in august. any reading above 50 signifies economic expansion. two days later, the organization will report on the economy’s service sectors. the bloomberg poll anticipates a decline to 56 from 57 in august. “the i.s.m. really gets to the pulse of things, to the actual purchasing manager, the person who’s right on the firing line of economic activity,” mr. macintosh said. the reports, he added, offer “a great way to look at the economy, and they come out early in the month, so they give a good early read.” photo in this case, the consensus calls for softer survey numbers, and mr. macintosh says those estimates may be too high. he predicts readings of 52 for manufacturing and 55 for service, or nonmanufacturing. advertisement continue reading the main story as for the employment data due friday, he expects a low number there, too. the bloomberg poll estimates that 120,000 net new jobs were created in september, but he thinks the figure will be “closer to 100,000.”

it might be supposed that the introduction and use of the various metals in egypt had been sufficiently dealt with in original works and compilations ; but frequent mis-statements that are met with show that a summary of the matter is needed. dating will be referred here entirely to egyptian dynasties, to avoid the confusion that has arisen from arbitrary shortening of periods. copper is the earliest metal of which we know anything in egypt. it occurs in the oldest prehistoric burials of sequence date 30, while gold, silver, and lead have not been yet found before their appearance in the beginning of the second prehistoric age, s.d. 42. the nearest important source of copper was in sinai, where 100,000 tons of copper slag, in the wady nasb alone, shows what a large industry was carried on there. later, the more distant source of the north syrian mines yielded a supply to egypt, as seen in the tribute from alashiya or asi ; probably still later in origin was the overseas supply from cyprus, which dussaud does not place till after the 1st dynasty. unfortunately there are very few analyses of metal and of ores in different neighbouring countries for comparison with those in egypt. at least we may note that a piece of prehistoric copper contained r55 per cent, zinc and only “38 of tin (naqadeh), while no zinc occurs in cypriote copper tools. copper

cappellini with a spicy tomato-cream sauce (before it's news) as anyone who has been reading this blog for a while knows, the toddster is really not very fond of pasta at all. i do make it from time to time, but more often than not i make something completely different for him, or he has the sauce, but on a potato instead. you will remember last week when i posted a review for the duo silocone and ceramics springform cake mold from lekue (what a fabulous pan) and today i want to show you something else they sent me!! this is the lekue microwave pasta cooker. cook any kind of pasta in the microwave, the fastest and cleanest way. cook, drain and serve in the same place it was very easy to use. on this day i cooked cappellini because that is what i had. as you can see here, you simply add the pasta to the cooker, cover it with water. place the lid on top and then cook in the microwave for the same time as is required as per package instructions. at the end of that time you should have perfectly cooked pasta, which you simply drain using the slotted lid, so no extra dish to wash. it did take my cappellini a tad bit longer than the original directions on the pasta, but that was not a problem. i simply popped it in for an extra minute. there are basic guidelines on the box in any case

Article 1 - nobody said snap-together meant it was a snap
the salt water fuel cell monster truck ($26, owirobots.com) is a labor-intensive snap-together model truck with an innovative diy battery - a tiny fuel cell, the same technology that some automakers like honda hope will provide the green future of personal transportation. inside the box you'll find a tiny electric motor, stamp-sized sheets of magnesium for power and about a hundred snap-together parts. because each part is molded at once, it must be carefully trimmed, a tedious job that requires some extra tools (we used nail clippers). also not in the box: some salt, water, a screwdriver and, for me, reading glasses in order to help me working my way through the 26 pages of instructions. building the truck consumed an entire evening of debugging by our 16-year-old exchange student, after a frustrating bout with a jammed piston, which also used half of our battery materials (refills cost $7). but we had fun, and learned that five drops of salt water, when carefully dripped onto the magnesium, can make enough power to make the truck grind across the floor for about 15 minutes. we also figured out that a single aa battery works, too, with a little duct tape. this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. photo

Article 2 - 2 cities and 4 bridges where commerce flows
but job growth and the availability of land in what had previously been thought of as the middle of nowhere have also drawn commercial real estate developers from the united states. verde corporate realty services, based in el paso, has invested along the entire united states-mexico border from tijuana to monterrey over the last five years, but most heavily in juárez . the company buys land and builds industrial spaces on speculation (that is, without a committed leaseholder). to date, verde has completed two million square feet and owns enough land to build almost three million more. because building in mexico is considered riskier, investors require a higher rate of return, which makes for higher rents. a building similar to one that verde leases for about $5 a square foot in juárez would bring about $3.80 in el paso. the main reason to build in juárez, of course, is the low cost of labor, not construction costs. at $38 to $42 per square foot to construct, verde spends more to build in juárez than it would in el paso. these new light assembly buildings are not the cheap, polluting maquiladoras of popular imagination, but modern high-tech buildings that would not be out of place in suburban dallas. for instance, verde recently completed a 217,000-square-foot building and leased it to the visteon corporation, an auto parts supplier that has more than 170 facilities in 24 countries. “when

Article 3 - democrats pressure trump to fulfill promise to impose steel tariffs
when the administration announced the investigation, “we felt, o.k., they’ve got the message. but they’ve just dragged their feet and delayed and delayed,” mr. schumer said. “the bottom line is the president has been a total paper tiger on this issue, and as a result, we feel the need to hold up nominees for the commerce department.” the delays in imposing the tariffs appear to have further worsened conditions for the american steel industry, which was already struggling financially with a global glut of cheap metal. to get ahead of the tariffs, foreign manufacturers appear to have shipped more steel and aluminum into the country. steel imports rose 20 percent in the five months since the investigation was announced in april, compared with the previous five months, the american iron and steel institute said on thursday. the import surges have helped fuel more layoffs and plant closings, according to scott paul, the president of the alliance for american manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers. according to mr. paul, that includes layoffs of 180 workers at the dura-bond industries plant in steelton, pa., and 150 workers at arcelormittal’s rolling mill in conshohocken, pa. the president signed executive orders in april calling for the department of commerce to open two separate investigations into whether imports of steel and aluminum were harming american national security. initiated under the rarely used section 232 of a 1962 trade law, the investigations gave the president broad authority

Article 4 - questions to ask before buying a shredder
when it comes to junk mail, some people destroy anything with their name and address on it. but according to the resource center, the most important things to destroy are offers from financial-services companies, like pre-approved credit cards, especially if they have barcodes for automated processing. thieves have been known to sign up for cards using these documents and then submit a new address, so victims don’t discover the problem until their credit ratings are ruined. also be sure to shred any “convenience checks” that arrive with credit card statements, ms. foley said. many people think they’re just marketing claptrap, but they are real checks tied to your account. and shred any other promotional offers someone could use, like invitations to add a card to your account or another phone line. what’s the right cut? experts recommend using, at minimum, a cross-cut shredder, which cuts a standard-size piece of paper into about 400 little rectangles. as mark mettler, senior vice president for merchandising at staples, put it, “picture a rolling pin full of teeth, and the teeth are meshing as the paper rolls through.” even with cross-cut, however, it’s possible that some numbers and words may remain visible, especially if the print is small. so people like lawyers or mental health professionals with home offices, who need to destroy highly sensitive information, may want to consider a micro-cut shredder, which cuts a standard page into about 3,000 pieces.

Article 5 - senegal waste pickers fight dump closure amid hazards and health risks
by nadia beard dakar (thomson reuters foundation) - at the top of a hill in the heart of senegal's largest rubbish dump, 47-year-old didou farai watched as hundreds of workers armed with metal rods picked through piles of waste in search of recyclable materials to sell. despite dire conditions, deadly accidents and toxic air, mbeubeuss, a sprawling landfill in a suburb of dakar, is a lifeline for thousands like farai - allowing them to make a modest living in a country where one in eight are unemployed. yet with no rights to the land, the estimated 3,500 workers who salvage, sell and recycle materials from the site fear their livelihoods will be wiped out if the senegalese government pushes ahead with plans to close mbeubeuss in the coming years. ""if they close it i'm afraid i'll no longer be able to earn a living,"" farai told the thomson reuters foundation. ""i've lived and worked here for over 10 years - i don't know what job i could do if i didn't have this."" mbeubeuss - a sprawling 175-hectare (432 acre) site that takes 475,000 tonnes of waste each year - is one of several ballooning open dumps across west africa, where residents are pitted against environmental activists and government officials. in ghana, the agbogbloshie landfill has become the world's largest

Article 6 - underground mail road; modern plans for all-but-forgotten delivery system
he pored through historical records at the post office, the division of old military and civil records of the national archives, the smithsonian and the new york public library. he filed a patent application for the conversion of the tubes and a right to the technology. for mr. stark, it has become detective work, as he tries to piece together information about a lost system that most new yorkers, then and now, had no idea was there. ''if even a small amount of these tubes still exist, it's a pretty valuable piece of property,'' he said. though he has yet to see the 100-year-old pipes firsthand, mr. stark says he is convinced that they are still usable -- especially since a fiber optic network would need no internal pressure -- and hopes to marry the two systems. his priority now, he said, is to descend to inspect them. first, he needs to get permission from the city. mr. stark says his research shows that the city was left possession of the tubes in 1954. but allan h. dobrin, the commissioner of the city's department of information technology and telecommunications, said it was unclear whether the tubes belonged to the city. ''we're determining who are the legal guardians for what's left of the system,'' he said. mr. dobrin said the department was also exploring the conversion of an unused water main system under the city into a conduit for fiber optic cable. the pneumatic tubes were introduced by the post office to

Article 7 - the sound of music as an obsession
next came a favorable magazine article about the machine. ''the guy who reviewed it told me, 'you're going to be selling a lot of them, so you better start a business,''' mr. weisfeld said. and so, vpi industries was born. (it is unclear what vpi stands for, and both the weisfelds clam up mysteriously when asked to explain.) the company originated in queens, where the weisfelds lived until a lack of space and a quest for better public schools for their two young sons uprooted them to new jersey in 1987. the vpi office in cliffwood is hardly bigger than a cubicle. outfitted with a single desk, a chair and a constantly ringing telephone, it sits in the center of a single-story, concrete-slab office complex directly off the garden state parkway. five steps in, a turn to the left leads to the nexus of activity -- a workshop-factory strewn with drills, stray parts and six assemblymen. an upright row of turntable arms awaiting inspection resembles a line of rockettes frozen in mid-kick. mrs. weisfeld handles the company's sales. for years its sole offering was that first cleaning machine, the hw-16, a not-unusual name in an arsenal of products that seem extracted from a ''star wars'' screenplay. upgrades like the vpi hw-16.5 and the hw-17 bi-directional don't exactly roll

Article 8 - scarcity, mother of invention
photo ithaca, n.y. in the wake of the closure of a bp oil field in prudhoe bay, alaska, oil prices shot up to $77 a barrel on wednesday, and the chorus of doomsayers concerned about the dire consequences of our fossil fuel dependency has reached a crescendo. if oil hits $100 a barrel, the impact on our economy and lifestyle could be catastrophic, the handwringers warn. but while such a specter seems novel and terrifying, it is in fact familiar and useful. throughout history, shortages of vital resources have driven innovation, and energy has often starred in these technological dramas. the desperate search for new sources of energy and new materials has frequently produced remarkable advances that no one could have imagined when the shortage first became evident. consider the transition from the use of bronze to iron in making tools and weapons, which occurred around the 12th century b.c. early in the second millennium b.c., iron was known as the stuff of meteorites. it was rare and highly prized: if you wanted to give a gift to a pharaoh or a king you didn’t give a gold dagger but an iron one. but when the eastern mediterranean fell short of tin from which to make bronze, a technological revolution occurred. artisans learned to extract metallic iron from iron-rich materials by heating with charcoal (a process called smelting), which caused the price of iron to fall by a factor of 80,000 over 1200

Content: letter re: a handy small faraday cage (before it's news) james, i found a surprise at the local wal-mart the other day: an american made 6 gallon galvanized metal container with locking lid (the bail is shaped to hold the tightly fitting lid closed when pulled up). with the lid on, it is approximately 15 inches high and about 14 inches in diameter at its widest point. the manufacturer is behrens manufacturing in winona, minnesota. besides making a great small container for feed, etc., it could be a great emp shield for your smaller electronic devices that will easily fit under a counter or bench. the price is good also: $$14.97 plus tax. – steve c. jwr replies: behrens manufacturing does indeed make a wide range of sizes of galvanized steel containers. most of them work fine for faraday cages. for the budget-minded: ask your relatives at christmas for any spare steel popcorn canisters and danish cookie gift tins. these steel containers have tight-fitting steel lids. as my father was fond of saying: ‘free is right in the middle of my price range!” source: http://www.survivalblog.com/2013/10/letter-re-a-handy-small-faraday-cage.html

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Here is a concise summary of the articles:

The concept of self-sufficiency involves using everyday items to create functional solutions. A ""handstand lap desk"" can be used as an end table, and a cushion can be placed underneath it to provide stability. Building a Faraday cage requires common materials like metal sheets and wire mesh.

Electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can damage electrical equipment. A Faraday cage can protect against these events by distributing electromagnetic charges evenly around its surface.

The modern survival movement emphasizes preparedness and self-sufficiency. Prizes include a power pot, deadwood cook stove, and survival gear kits for participating in contests.

Bulk liquid transportation is crucial for industries that process food, refine oil, or generate power. ISO tanks are used to transport hazardous materials safely.

Metals like copper have been used in ancient Egypt, with copper slag found in the Sinai region. The use of metals varied across different dynasties and regions.

A microwave pasta cooker can cook pasta quickly and efficiently using a silicone cake mold. A nano coating egg steamer can be made using common items like an egg cooker or steamer.

An ultra compact pocket stove can be built using a nivea cream container and other common materials, featuring a built-in pot stand for convenience.

These articles discuss various topics related to self-sufficiency, preparedness, and DIY projects.

The article also provides specific details about the events, such as the date of the eviction, the involvement of activists, and the reaction of Iris' lawyer. Overall, the article appears to be a factual report on a real event, making it a reliable news source.","A 100-year-old woman, Iris Canada, was evicted from her home in San Francisco's Fillmore District after a court battle. The eviction followed a decision by Judge James Robertson II to execute the writ of possession.

In another case, a family with children was forcibly quarantined under armed guard after a cleaning crew refused to enter their contaminated apartment. The quarantine order banned visitors and was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request to stay home.

A 20-year-old nurse, Alexis Williams, was arrested for secretly recording two adult residents having consensual sex in a nursing facility without their knowledge. She posted the video on Snapchat, which led to her arrest and charges of video voyeurism.

In China, a woman took her own life after authorities threatened to evict her from her building due to forced evictions. The family had refused to move despite being offered less than one-third of the usual compensation for their home.

A family with children was unlawfully threatened with eviction by Wandsworth Council in London after reneging on a home swap agreement. The council agreed to allow the large family to remain in their mother's home but later changed its decision, leaving the family facing homelessness.

The case of Casey Anthony and her imaginary friend ""Zanny the Nanny"" has led to toy stores cashing in on the story. Vendors are selling dolls and merchandise featuring the character, which was a key part of the prosecution's case against Anthony.

In Texas, mass kidnappings have been reported, with some critics labeling them as outrageous due to the state's history of similar incidents, including the Waco horror.","Assisted living facilities often have fewer than 16 residents, making them less noticeable in neighborhoods. These small-scale facilities can be a reasonable option for people with daily activity needs, particularly those with dementia. They typically cost less and have better staffing ratios.

The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks led to reassessments of relationships with cities, with some families forced to confront questions about their connection to the city. The decision-making process was often under difficult circumstances, with many families struggling to find their way home.

Homeowners facing foreclosure are seeking recourse due to what they perceive as inadequate bank practices. Consumer lawyers report being overwhelmed with cases involving faulty paperwork and robo-signers. However, most homeowners in foreclosure have not paid their bills, leading to eventual loss of homes.

Gentrification is a complex issue, with many politicians dependent on real-estate contributions. Some candidates are making issues out of taking no money from such interests, highlighting the need for transparency in campaign finance.

Neighborhoods can change over time, with new residents moving into old houses. The concept of ""tract"" neighborhoods emerged as original residents built four tracts in what was once a rural area.

Animal waste is a public health concern, and authorities may issue fines to property owners who fail to clean up after their pets. In some cases, the responsible dog owner may be identified through note-leafing or other means.

Community development projects can revitalize neighborhoods, with architects and community members working together to create homes and laboratories for families. These initiatives often involve grassroots efforts, such as recycling programs and advocacy groups.

Homeowners are seeking answers about bank practices that led to foreclosure, with some cases involving faulty paperwork and robo-signers. However, most homeowners in foreclosure have not paid their bills, leading to eventual loss of homes.

new feminoid horror by alan stang may 29, 2008 newswithviews.com every time the love priestess and i see the flds people on the news, we cannot help but shudder. maybe scripture is the reason. but one need not be a bible scholar to know that these folks are creepy crawly. that is the reflex polygamy produces, heightened by the stilted, halting way they answer questions. the utter weirdness of their practice apparently infuses everything they do. but, guess what? however weird they are, and whatever my wife and i think about it, is totally irrelevant. these are the united (sic) states. did you remember? this is where you can be as weird as you like. this is where the constitution guarantees that right. of course, i do not expect members of congress to know that, but you do. that is what makes the recent mass kidnappings in texas so outrageous. texas used to boast that it surpassed every other state, which was true – for instance, if you melt alaska down to its true size, you would have an area about the size of taxachusetts – but the kidnappings are strike two and three strikes are out. texas was also the site of the waco horror, in which alcoholic bull dyke janet reno, rapist bill clinton’s attorney general, and switch hitter hillary incinerated mothers and children to “protect” them from a man who said

the new old age paula span posted at nytimes.com/newoldage. it's right in my neighborhood, so i've probably driven past that gracious victorian house, painted a dusty rose, a zillion times. but because it looks like many other houses in montclair, n.j., i never realized that it was an assisted living facility. of the one million people in assisted living, about one-third live in residences with fewer than 16 residents, said karl polzer, senior policy director of the national council on assisted living. several of the nine current residents at the victorian house, called horizon manor south, were just finishing lunch in the sunny dining room when i came by for a visit. three women chatted over their canned peaches; two others ate in silence. because few of these small homes can afford to do much marketing, and because they blend into neighborhoods, they are often overlooked. but small-scale assisted living remains a reasonable option for people who need help with daily activities, particularly those with dementia. they often cost less, and you can't beat the staffing ratio. in this house, for example, three staff members are caring for nine residents each day, with two staff members each on the evening and overnight shifts. i could see some disadvantages, too. there isn't a lot of organized activity, and most of the current residents have some degree of dementia; an alert older person who wants to play scrabble or take field trips to the museum would

Article 2 - which way is home?
in some respects, sept. 11 was just the beginning. subsequent shock waves included the anthrax scare along with threats to the subway system, the brooklyn bridge, the statue of liberty and times square. although relatively few families eventually left -- no reliable figures exist as to exactly how many -- the decision-making process forced people to reassess their relationship with the city. as tenants of 600 gateway plaza, one of only two residential buildings physically damaged in the attack (the other was 114 liberty street), the galloways and fortinskys confronted these questions early on and under harrowing circumstances. their building became an f.b.i. crime scene, their neighborhood an international epicenter of mourning. they became refugees, separated from the small, ridiculously meaningful things -- a thomas the tank engine table, a beloved dog's ashes -- that make a few rooms a place of significance. though a year later, one family remains in new york and the other has left, both the galloways and the fortinskys struggled hard to find their way home. unbreakable tie like generations of new yorkers before them, the galloways were drawn to the city like dorothy to oz. jeff galloway had arrived in 1978 from california to attend columbia law school, which he had chosen specifically so he could live the exciting life of a new yorker. four years later, he became one of the first residents of the newly opened gateway plaza, a cluster of

Article 4 - homeowners facing foreclosure demand recourse
some consumer lawyers say they are now swamped with homeowners saying they have been wronged by slipshod bank practices and want to fight to keep their homes. joseph demello, a massachusetts lawyer who represents mr. rought, said the common denominator in many of the cases was an overwhelmed system of foreclosures in which banks relied on subcontractors to do much of the work. “no one double-checks anything,” he said. “it’s completely high volume and that’s unfortunately what leads to this.” it may never be known how many homeowners have legitimate claims against the banks, real estate and banking experts say, because lenders do not release such data and because the vast majority of cases never make it to court. for the last month or so, some of the nation’s largest banks have temporarily halted foreclosures in some states amid accusations that the paperwork used as evidence to oust homeowners was incomplete or signed off by so-called robo-signers who did little to check its veracity. even if the paperwork was faulty, the fact remains that most homeowners in foreclosure have not paid their bills, often because they bought more house than they could afford or because they lost their jobs. as a result, they will most likely lose their homes eventually, once the banks clean up their paperwork and resolve any outstanding legal issues. photo “we believe that the overwhelming majority of the cases will be that the loan was seriously delinquent and needed to go to foreclosure,” said paul leon

Article 5 - running on rent, and winning
another barrier to making gentrification an electoral issue is, of course, the fact that so many seeking office are themselves dependent on contributions from real-estate interests. ms. richardson, who won her seat in the legislature running only on the working families party line (the first to do so), made a big issue of the fact that she had taken no money from such interests. for instance, her chief rival in the four-way race, shirley patterson, had received donations from glenwood management, which owns thousands of apartments in the city, many governed by rent regulations that are up for renewal next month. over the past decade glenwood has made over $12 million in political contributions. the 43rd assembly district has the third-highest concentration of rent-regulated apartments in the state, ms. richardson told me on sunday, just before she was to head to her first day of work in albany. we were standing in front of a building in crown heights where, she explained, longtime tenants are fighting escalating rents at the hands of a landlord who was using the preferential rent loophole in rent-regulation laws, in an effort to push them out. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank

''when we changed something, we always thought, 'what would mrs. strauss have thought?' '' steve herman said. next door to us when we moved in were the tollins, three generations of them. there was the one son, mark, and mrs. tollin's parents from england, daisy and fred moss. they provided whatever celebrity there was on south bowling green in those days, since mrs. tollin's cousin was sterling moss, an international race-car driving star in midcentury. now scott and ellen friedman live there, and they are woodcrest legacies. she grew up on lilac lane near barby lane, named for harold sarshik's daughter barbara. scott lived on russet, which was ''the woods'' before houses went up there in the 1970's. ''ellen always liked it here, so when we eventually got married, we decided to look for a house in woodcrest,'' scott friedman said. ''but when we moved in, this house was a god-awful mess. there were candles all over the place, i guess, so we wouldn't see what was bad. but it had this big picture window and ellen was pregnant, so we said we would clean it up and make it ours.'' south bowling green drive was in what original residents called ''the first tract'' of woodcrest. eventually, the sarshiks built four tracts

Article 7 - when the dog isn’t yours, but the fine for its waste is
ms. archer complained to cass smith, the neighboring building’s owner. mr. smith said he ordered his tenant to immediately cease. “i’m pro dog,” he said, “but not at the expense of anyone else.” when the problem continued, ms. archer went to the police, who she said recommended asking the department of public health to intervene. on jan. 13, irene sanchez, a health department investigator, toured the roof, took notes, and promised action. “i was relieved to have someone who was going to have an impact on the situation,” ms. archer said. one week later, a “notice of violation” letter arrived in the mail — not to the dog’s owner, but to ms. archer’s building, which was “hereby declared to be a public nuisance.” if the waste was not removed immediately, the fine would be $163. ms. sanchez said that animal feces could spread disease and that ms. archer’s building, even though it had been victimized, was culpable. “i didn’t see the dog,” ms. sanchez said. “we don’t know whose dog waste it is.” but it took only a matter of minutes — by leaving a note at the neighboring building — for the bay citizen to find the responsible dog. her name is jane, a 50-pound, shepherd mix with long black hair — a rescue dog sometimes cared for by howie correa, a tenant

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A 100-year-old woman, Iris Canada, was evicted from her home in San Francisco's Fillmore District after a court battle. The eviction followed a decision by Judge James Robertson II to execute the writ of possession.

In another case, a family with children was forcibly quarantined under armed guard after a cleaning crew refused to enter their contaminated apartment. The quarantine order banned visitors and was imposed after the family failed to comply with a request to stay home.

A 20-year-old nurse, Alexis Williams, was arrested for secretly recording two adult residents having consensual sex in a nursing facility without their knowledge. She posted the video on Snapchat, which led to her arrest and charges of video voyeurism.

In China, a woman took her own life after authorities threatened to evict her from her building due to forced evictions. The family had refused to move despite being offered less than one-third of the usual compensation for their home.

A family with children was unlawfully threatened with eviction by Wandsworth Council in London after reneging on a home swap agreement. The council agreed to allow the large family to remain in their mother's home but later changed its decision, leaving the family facing homelessness.

The case of Casey Anthony and her imaginary friend ""Zanny the Nanny"" has led to toy stores cashing in on the story. Vendors are selling dolls and merchandise featuring the character, which was a key part of the prosecution's case against Anthony.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Assisted living facilities often have fewer than 16 residents, making them less noticeable in neighborhoods. These small-scale facilities can be a reasonable option for people with daily activity needs, particularly those with dementia. They typically cost less and have better staffing ratios.

The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks led to reassessments of relationships with cities, with some families forced to confront questions about their connection to the city. The decision-making process was often under difficult circumstances, with many families struggling to find their way home.

Homeowners facing foreclosure are seeking recourse due to what they perceive as inadequate bank practices. Consumer lawyers report being overwhelmed with cases involving faulty paperwork and robo-signers. However, most homeowners in foreclosure have not paid their bills, leading to eventual loss of homes.

Gentrification is a complex issue, with many politicians dependent on real-estate contributions. Some candidates are making issues out of taking no money from such interests, highlighting the need for transparency in campaign finance.

Neighborhoods can change over time, with new residents moving into old houses. The concept of ""tract"" neighborhoods emerged as original residents built four tracts in what was once a rural area.

Animal waste is a public health concern, and authorities may issue fines to property owners who fail to clean up after their pets. In some cases, the responsible dog owner may be identified through note-leafing or other means.

9582421.0,reliable,reliable,0.9,113.16581559181212,True,"The article best matches the Reliable News Summary, as it accurately reports on the recent rulings by federal judges regarding the treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay. The summary correctly states that the judiciary lacks authority to intervene over the conditions under which detainees are being jailed and that Judge Kessler's ruling was in favor of the detainees. Additionally, the article mentions the government's contention that the detainees were receiving ""timely, compassionate, quality health care,"" which is mentioned in the Reliable News Summary as well. The only discrepancy between the two summaries is the mention of a judge banning the use of the term ""torture"" in a 9/11 terrorism case, which is not present in the article. However, this does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the Reliable News Summary.","The Guantanamo Bay detention center has been a subject of controversy, with various articles highlighting issues related to its operations. The administration's handling of detainees has been criticized, including the indefinite detention without trial and force-feeding of hunger strikers.

A judge has banned the use of the term ""torture"" in a 9/11 terrorism case, citing that it is not relevant to the issue at hand. Meanwhile, the Berkeley City Council has proposed inviting Guantanamo Bay detainees to resettle in their community, despite concerns about the detainees' backgrounds and potential threat to national security.

The Obama administration has warned that a judge's ruling blocking the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects has jeopardized its ability to continue detaining certain prisoners. The government has argued that the ruling threatens national security and public interest.

There have been reports of harsh treatment of border patrol agents, with some comparing it to the conditions faced by Guantanamo Bay detainees. The issue has sparked calls for an investigation into prosecutorial misconduct.

A hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay has led to renewed scrutiny of the prison's conditions, with over 166 men remaining detained despite being cleared for release. The majority of these prisoners are Yemenis and have never been charged with a crime.

Psychological pressures on detainees held captive by enemies have been described in handwritten notes obtained from a former CIA psychologist. These notes suggest that torture was used to break down detainees mentally, rather than solely for intelligence gathering purposes.

These articles highlight the complexities and controversies surrounding Guantanamo Bay detention center operations, raising concerns about human rights, national security, and the treatment of detainees.","The Supreme Court ruled in favor of detainees at Guantánamo Bay, rejecting the government's claims that they could be held without due process. The court's decision marked the third time it had rebuked the administration's lawless actions.

In another development, Maryland's governor ordered the immediate shuttering of a troubled Baltimore jail after allegations of corruption and gang control by corrections officers. An FBI affidavit described how guards smuggled contraband or engaged in sex with inmates to gain their allegiance.

Military lawyers were caught in the middle on tribunals, with some signing a letter supporting the administration's plan despite private reservations. The issue centered on the use of torture and interrogation techniques during the war on terror.

Guantánamo Bay detainees sought to see their families and lawyers, citing concerns about being held without access to counsel or family members. The court's ruling was seen as a triumph for the rule of law and separation of powers.

The administration imposed new rules restricting access to counsel for prisoners not actively challenging their detention at Guantánamo Bay. Lawyers argued that these rules were unconstitutional and denied detainees an essential right.

In related news, the use of drone strikes in countries outside Afghanistan was questioned by a UN special rapporteur, who declared them unlawful. The number of persons killed in drone attacks is estimated to be between 3,000 and 4,500, including over 200 children.

welcome to guantánamo, the president’s private prison (before it's news) by nat hentoff published: january 07, 2011 a major part of a presidential press secretary’s job is to cover up his boss’s violations of our rule of constitutional law by denying they happened. yet, on dec. 25, robert gibbs actually said on cnn’s “state of the union” (reported the next day on politicolive.com) that “it’s unfortunate that some terrorist suspects at guantanamo bay need to be held indefinitely without trial.” gibbs did say that some would be tried in federal courts, although, as he knows, congress bipartisanly is dead set against that. “some,” he went on smoothly, “would be tried in military commissions, likely spending the rest of their lives in a maximum-security prison that nobody, including terrorists, have ever escaped from” (gibbs-style due process). but parts of the constitution are excluded from military commissions. in any case, gibbs continued, “some, regrettably, will have to be indefinitely detained.” if for life, then very regrettably. indeed, as the ever-vigilant st. petersburg times columnist robyn blumner had already reported (dec. 23): our constitutional-scholar president is preparing an executive order (bypassing congress) to create a periodic review procedure for the 48 detainees the administration intends to hold without trial,

(before it's news) stephen lendman activist post guantanamo detention constitutes torture, abuse and ill-treatment. long-term detention compounds it. force-feeding increases unconscionable pain and suffering. doing so violates core rule of law principles. around 130 of 166 guantanamo detainees refuse food. they’re hunger striking for justice. they began in february. they passed 100 days. they’d rather die than endure injustice. their only escape route is death. pentagon officials at first maintained silence. belatedly they admitted what’s well-known. they consistently downplayed it. now they admit 102 detainees refuse food. at least 130 are involved. obama dismissively said nothing. his belated acknowledgement reflected disdain for their pain and suffering. thirty or more hunger strikers are being force-fed. doing so constitutes torture. a previous article explained. detainees are restrained in chairs. they’re called “padded cells on wheels.” tubes are forced painfully through their noses and throats to their stomachs. it’s done abrasively. it draws blood. liquid nutrients are pumped into their stomachs. doing so causes excruciating pain. no sedatives or anesthesia are given. men are kept strapped under restraints up to two hours. it’s done to prevent purging. the procedure’s repeated twice daily. tubes are reused. they’re covered in blood

(before it's news) this is flat out ridiculous. how can a community with so many smart people consistently do things that spit in the face of america’s soldiers? oh yeah, i forgot…this is just another way to show patriotism. what a joke. from real clear politics: on feb. 15, on the recommendation of its peace & justice commission, the berkeley (calif.) city council is set to vote on a resolution to invite “one or two cleared” guantanamo bay detainees to resettle in berkeley. peace & justice commissioner rita maran told me that the idea was to invite to berkeley “the kind of people you’d like to have living next door to you or dating your cousin.” while the resolution doesn’t name the one or two detainees, her panel presented material that cites two — russian-born ravil mingazov and algerian-born djamel ameziane — whom it claims have been “cleared.” the resolution also asserts that “cleared” detainees have been determined to “pose no threat to the united states.” where they got that information, i do not know. given that the director of national intelligence reported in december that 25 percent of released gitmo detainees have been confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorism, the commission’s assertion would not be reassuring, if it were true. as thomas joscelyn, senior fellow for the foundation for the defense of democracies, observed, “there’s an entire mythology”

Article 5 - the internet post
washington — the obama administration warned monday that a judge’s ruling last weekblocking a statute authorizing the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects has jeopardized its ability to continue detaining certain prisoners captured during the war in afghanistan. in an emergency appeal of the ruling, the government asserted that united states district court judge katherine b. forrest went beyond enjoining the statute — enacted last year as part of the national defense authorization act — and potentially curtailed detention powers it has been exercising for years under its interpretation of the authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the sept. 11, 2001, attacks. judge forrest’s order “threatens irreparable harm to national security and the public interest by injecting added burdens and dangerous confusion into the conduct of military operations abroad during an active armed conflict,” the government wrote in a 38-page filing with the federal appeals court in new york. the motion focused on language used by judge forrest that rejected interpreting the original use-of-force authorization as including the ability to detain “substantial supporters” of al qaeda and the taliban, as opposed to people who are actually part of those groups. the judge also called into question the idea that the united states could detain members or supporters of “associated forces” that had no involvement in the sept. 11 attacks. “if, following issuance of this permanent injunctive relief, the government detains individuals under theories of ‘substantially or directly supporting’ associated forces

Article 6 - nwv news -- bush treating terrorists better than imprisoned border patrol agents
bush treating terrorists better than imprisoned border patrol agents by jim kouri posted 1:00 am eastern october 19, 2007 newswithviews.com in a biting letter, congressman dana rohrabacher (r-ca) blasted president george w. bush and his administration for treating terrorists better than they treat the two convicted border patrol agents, ignacio ramos and jose compean. rep. rohrabacher called on the bush administration to conduct a thorough review of the harsh treatment the two decorated border agents are receiving while in solitary confinement. the popular conservative wrote to president bush that for 10 months ramos and compean have been in conditions more severe than experienced by terrorists held by the us at the naval base in guantanamo bay, cuba. rohrabacher told the news media in a statement that he has written a letter to manhattan federal trial judge michael mukasey, bush's nominee to replace alberto gonzales as us attorney general, demanding that upon confirmation mukasey conduct an unbiased review of the agents' prosecution. ""given the close personal relationship between the prosecuting us attorney johnny sutton, former attorney general alberto gonzales and president bush, past requests for inquiries into prosecutorial misconduct in this case have been ignored,"" rohrabacher claimed in his statement.

can we have a discussion about releasing the majority of the guantánamo prisoners? (before it's news) from fff with the prisonwide hunger strike at guantánamo now entering its third month, conditions at the prison have come under sustained scrutiny for the first time in many years, and media outlets, both domestic and international, have learned, or have been reminded, that 166 men remain at the prison. they remain imprisoned despite barack obama’s promise to close guantánamo, which he made when he first took office in january 2009, and despite the fact that more than half of them — 86 in total — were cleared for release from the prison in 2009 by an interagency guantánamo review task force, established by the president to decide who should be freed and who should continue to be held. for those of us who understand that guantánamo will poison america’s moral standing as long as it remains open, the awakening or reawakening of interest in the prison — and the prisoners — is progress. there is still some way to go before obama or lawmakers understand that they need to release prisoners or face the very real prospect that all the prisoners still held at guantánamo will remain there until they die, even though the overwhelming majority have never been charged with any crime and never will be. two-thirds of the 86 prisoners cleared for release are yemenis, but after a nigerian man

this diagram was included in a paper written by dr. bruce jessen’s and shows his view of the conflicting psychological pressures bearing down on a prisoner who is held captive by an enemy. (click here to view full image.) december 7, 2013 dr. bruce jessen’s handwritten notes describe some of the torture techniques that were used to “exploit” “war on terror” detainees in custody of the cia and department of defense. bush administration officials have long asserted that the torture techniques used on “war on terror” detainees were utilized as a last resort in an effort to gain actionable intelligence to thwart pending terrorist attacks against the united states and its interests abroad. but the handwritten notes obtained exclusively by truthout drafted two decades ago by dr. john bruce jessen, the psychologist who was under contract to the cia and credited as being one of the architects of the government’s top-secret torture program, tell a dramatically different story about the reasons detainees were brutalized and it was not just about obtaining intelligence. jason leopold interviews jessen’s former sere colleague, retired air force capt. michael kearns. rather, as jessen’s notes explain, torture was used to “exploit” detainees, that is, to break them down physically and mentally, in order to get them to “collaborate” with government authorities. jessen’s notes emphasize how a “detainer” uses the stresses of detention to produce the appearance of compliance in

Article 1 - a ruling on the rights of the detained
to the editor: re “justices, 5-4, back detainee appeals for guantánamo” (front page, june 13): the supreme court’s decision marked the third time the court has rebuked this administration’s lawless actions at guantánamo. it shows that the judiciary will not lie down while this or any administration further harms the health and sanity of the men who have been held there in harsh conditions with no due process for the last six and a half years. the decision will go a long way to eliminating any future temptation to engage in lawless abuses because no court is watching. the executive may no longer falsely claim credit for detaining and incapacitating terrorists when in many documented cases they have just swept up innocent men and hidden them from scrutiny. we have been working tirelessly representing the detainees since the day they arrived, and the supreme court has answered our call for justice. now it’s imperative that the lower courts move with full speed in adjudicating the prisoners’ cases so they do not spend one more day than necessary without a fair hearing. vincent warren executive director center for constitutional rights new york, june 13, 2008  to the editor: agreed: we must protect our nation. but how tragic if we throw away 200 years of constitutional wisdom, based on arguments of immediate efficacy. advertisement continue reading the main story we face a fundamental decision in our day: do we choose to trust the constitution,

Article 2 - maryland&#8217;s governor orders immediate shuttering of long-troubled baltimore jail
or, as mr. hogan said on thursday, “inmates were literally running this prison.” “making matters even worse, a number of employees either stood by, or in many cases enabled these criminals and the vast corruption that quickly followed,” he said. “maryland taxpayers were unwittingly underwriting a vast criminal enterprise run by gang members and corrupt public servants.” it is a characterization that the f.b.i. and prosecutors publicly made in 2013, saying the jail was being run by members of the black guerrilla family, the gang that mr. white commanded. gang members had cemented control not just from payoffs or profit-sharing, but also by having sex with many of the female guards, manipulating the very people who were supposed to be watching over them. photo corrupt corrections officers, an f.b.i. affidavit said, “give their allegiance and loyalty to these inmates in an effort to make money and/or further their sexual relationships.” by one inmate’s estimate cited in the affidavit, about two-thirds of the guards smuggled contraband or were having sex with inmates. gang documents recovered by officials at a maryland prison even described how black guerrilla family recruits were instructed to “target a specific stereotype” of corrections officer who could be easily manipulated: “women with low self-esteem, insecurities and certain physical attributes.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must

Article 3 - military lawyers caught in middle on tribunals
what followed was a scuffle that left at least some of the military lawyers embittered and stoked old tensions at the pentagon between civilian leaders and uniformed military officers, who under defense secretary donald h. rumsfeld have often found themselves privately at odds. early thursday morning, white house allies distributed the letter that the lawyers had signed, as evidence that the group, known as jags, now supported the administration plan. that prompted loud protests from republican senators opposed to the plan. they dismissed the letter on grounds that the lawyers would have signed it only under pressure. the truth lies somewhere in between, said one of the senior lawyers and other current and former military officials familiar with their views. “i didn’t have any problem signing what i signed,’’ maj. gen. charles j. dunlap jr., deputy judge advocate general of the air force, said friday in an interview. “how people use it and what they use it for i can’t control.’’ general dunlap represented the air force at the meeting because the top lawyer was out of town. a spokesman for the pentagon, bryan whitman, said it was nonsense to suggest that the military lawyers had been coerced, a point that general dunlap agreed with. “do you really think that an officer with 30 years’ service could be coerced by the pentagon bureaucracy to sign something he didn’t want to sign?” general dunlap asked. advertisement continue reading the main story of the

Article 4 - guantánamo prisoners seek to see families and lawyers
paul d. clement, the deputy solicitor general who argued for the justice department, said the detainees were being held not only to take them off the battlefield but also as a resource of information about al qaeda. mr. clement said that they were held at guantánamo ''to facilitate intelligence gathering'' and that the authorities wanted the detainees available to answer questions that might arise as new information came in. he suggested that the value of such questioning would be limited if the detainees were able to have open communications with family members and lawyers. ''one of the fundamental aspects of holding someone as an enemy combatant is that you can hold them without access to counsel, without access to their family,'' mr. clement said. ''the authority to hold them at all is the authority to hold them under those conditions.'' the main issue in the case revolves around the unusual legal status of the guantánamo base. officials chose the base, in southeast cuba, because it was isolated from civilians and remote enough to allow the government to control the detainees. the authorities also said they thought the base would be out of reach of american courts. in july, judge colleen kollar-kotelly of the federal district court for the district of columbia confirmed that strategy when she ruled that the base was not formally part of the united states and that as a result the detainees did not have constitutional protections. under well-established principles, even noncitizens have some constitutional protections once they are

Article 5 - interrogation, torture and personal responsibility
our team — led by the masthead editor rebecca corbett with the correspondent james risen and the deputy investigations editor, gabriel dance — realized that the hours of video offered something powerful for our audience: personal narratives of a pivotal episode in recent american history and its lasting repercussions. in particular, dr. jessen, who has avoided speaking publicly about his involvement, expressed both pride in his actions and ambivalence about them. a 10-minute video on our website, produced by malachy browne and natalie reneau and overseen by mark scheffler, and titled “c.i.a. torture: interrogating the interrogators” uses split-frames to juxtapose former counterterrorism director jose rodriguez — speaking tersely about the “stress position” technique — with former detainee suleiman abdullah salim, who breaks down sobbing while describing how painful it was to hold a position for hours, chained to a wall. a 20-minute podcast episode produced by members of the daily, including lynsea garrison, michael barbaro, lisa tobin, theo balcomb and andy mills, focuses in for long stretches as the accused psychologists explain themselves. they talk about having answered a call to serve their country, saying that they never set out to hurt anyone and tried to stop using the most coercive techniques, but were pressed by mr. rodriguez and others to keep going. one of the main points the health professionals

Article 6 - court's ruling is likely to force negotiations over presidential power
then, last year, came the overwhelming 90-to-9 vote in the senate, over mr. cheney's strong objections, to ban ""cruel, inhumane and degrading"" treatment of prisoners. that forced mr. bush, grudgingly, to reach an accord with senator john mccain, republican of arizona, on principles for interrogation, which are still being turned into rules. as seen by mr. bush's critics, the court has finally reined in an executive who used the sept. 11 attacks as a justification — or an excuse — to tilt the balance of power decidedly toward the white house. ""this is a great triumph for the rule of law and the separation of powers,"" said bruce ackerman, a professor of law and political science at yale. ""the administration will have to go back to congress and talk in a much more discriminating fashion about what we need to do."" some allies of mr. bush reacted bitterly on thursday, asserting that it was the court, rather than mr. bush, that had overreacted. ""nothing about the administration's solution was radical or even particularly aggressive,"" said bradford a. berenson, who served from 2001 to 2003 as associate white house counsel. ""what is truly radical is the supreme court's willingness to bend to world opinion and undermine some of the most important foundations of american national security law in the middle of a war."" at least rhetor

Article 7 - the questions brennan can’t dodge
i was struck to find my name on page 4 of the white paper, which summarized my argument that “the conflict between the united states and al qaeda cannot lawfully extend to nations outside afghanistan in which the level of hostilities is less intense or prolonged than in afghanistan itself.” the lawyers dismissed my view, arguing that “there is little judicial or other authoritative precedent” on the issue, since the nation is fighting a “transnational, non-state actor” where the “principal theater of operations” is not in a country in conflict with america. these are more than legal quibbles. when hellfire missiles were first used in drone strikes to kill outside a combat zone — in yemen, in 2002 — six men died, including an american. a united nations special rapporteur declared the action unlawful, but c.i.a. drone attacks have increased substantially since then: the bureau of investigative journalism, a nonprofit news organization in london, estimates the number of persons killed in drone attacks at 3,000 to 4,500, including well over 200 children. today, the united states is involved in a true armed conflict only in afghanistan. yet drone attacks have been carried out in yemen, somalia and pakistan and may soon begin in libya, mali and nigeria. none of these countries have attacked america, so no right of self-defense can be invoked under the united nations charter, as the white paper asserts. newsletter sign up

Article 8 - the right to counsel at guant&aacute;namo bay
lawyers for the government and for detainees in guantánamo bay, cuba, are scheduled to square off in federal court in washington on friday over new rules imposed this spring by the obama administration restricting access to counsel for prisoners not actively challenging their detention. they are neither fair nor constitutional. a court order currently ensures that detainees have access to lawyers and sets out steps they must follow to work with counsel, including how they use classified material. under the new rules, those not challenging their detention would not be guaranteed access to their lawyers; the authorities at guantánamo would have power to determine access. and lawyers would no longer have guaranteed access to their own files containing classified information, which are kept at a secure facility, unless the authorities approved that, too. the administration has not said why it is now necessary to impose these restrictions, since the older approach has worked acceptably for the past eight years. the government said in a filing last week that the new rules, which lawyers must agree to before meeting with their clients, do not require detainees “to waive whatever right to counsel they may have under federal law.” but the rules give the guantánamo commander the unreviewable “authority and discretion” to decide whether a lawyer and a detainee can meet, undercutting their right to counsel. the rules are unconstitutional because they deny detainees an essential right and meaningful court review. by giving such discretion to the guantánamo commander, the obama administration asserts virtually unbrid

Title: guant&aacute;namo rulings change little
Content: over the last two weeks, three federal judges have issued rulings on the legitimacy of the recent rough treatment being doled out to the detainees at guantánamo bay , cuba . under normal circumstances, two of the rulings would add up to a resounding victory for the detainees. but at guantánamo bay, where prisoners the government itself acknowledges are not security threats can see no end to their decade-plus imprisonment, nothing is “normal.” the rulings began on july 8, when judge gladys kessler opined that the force-feeding of detainees who have been on a hunger strike was “painful, humiliating and degrading” — which is to say, precisely, what the detainees and their lawyers have been claiming for months. she scoffed at the government’s contention that the detainees were receiving “timely, compassionate, quality health care.” three days later, royce c. lamberth , the chief judge for the federal district court in the district of columbia , ruled that prison guards had to stop touching the genitals of the detainees as part of new, tougher search protocols. since early this year, meetings and even phone calls between detainees and their lawyers have had to take place outside the prisoner’s own “camp.” this meant they had to be searched in this offensive manner both on the trip out to see their lawyers and on the trip back. because many detainees had religious objections to the genital searches, they were refusing to speak to their lawyers. (the third ruling, on july 16, by judge rosemary collyer of federal district court, disagreed with kessler. collyer wrote that force-feeding was humane and that the detainees “had no right to commit suicide.”) advertisement continue reading the main story did anything change as a result of the opinions by kessler and lamberth? no. despite her clear dismay at the treatment of the detainees, kessler concluded that she lacked the ability to do anything about it because, she said, the judiciary doesn’t have the authority to intervene over the conditions under which the detainees are being jailed. photo

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The Guantanamo Bay detention center has been a subject of controversy, with various articles highlighting issues related to its operations. The administration's handling of detainees has been criticized, including the indefinite detention without trial and force-feeding of hunger strikers.

A judge has banned the use of the term ""torture"" in a 9/11 terrorism case, citing that it is not relevant to the issue at hand. Meanwhile, the Berkeley City Council has proposed inviting Guantanamo Bay detainees to resettle in their community, despite concerns about the detainees' backgrounds and potential threat to national security.

The Obama administration has warned that a judge's ruling blocking the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects has jeopardized its ability to continue detaining certain prisoners. The government has argued that the ruling threatens national security and public interest.

There have been reports of harsh treatment of border patrol agents, with some comparing it to the conditions faced by Guantanamo Bay detainees. The issue has sparked calls for an investigation into prosecutorial misconduct.

A hunger strike at Guantanamo Bay has led to renewed scrutiny of the prison's conditions, with over 166 men remaining detained despite being cleared for release. The majority of these prisoners are Yemenis and have never been charged with a crime.

Psychological pressures on detainees held captive by enemies have been described in handwritten notes obtained from a former CIA psychologist. These notes suggest that torture was used to break down detainees mentally, rather than solely for intelligence gathering purposes.

These articles highlight the complexities and controversies surrounding Guantanamo Bay detention center operations,

Article 2 - the workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit
the workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit (before it's news) on saturday, the socialist equality party in the us is holding a workers inquiry into the bankruptcy of detroit and the attack on the dia & pensions. the aim of the inquiry is to uncover the social and historical roots of the bankruptcy of detroit and expose the political and financial interests behind this attack on the working class. the purpose of the meeting is to provide workers and young people with the knowledge they need to fight back. the inquiry is being held as emergency manager kevyn orr, detroit’s financial dictator, prepares to release his “plan of adjustment.” worked out in collaboration with the city’s biggest creditors, the plan will call for the gutting of the pensions and health benefits of more than 20,000 retired city workers and the privatization of public assets, including the cultural treasures of the detroit institute of arts (dia). what is taking place in detroit is a social crime of immense proportions. an entire city is being plundered in order to further enrich the financial elite. what happens in detroit will, moreover, be used as a precedent for the rest of the united states and for working class populations around the world. the inquiry will seek to establish that the bankruptcy is the product not simply of abstract economic forces, but of a political conspiracy being carried out in behalf of definite class interests, involving michigan’s republican governor, state and local democrats, powerful financial and legal firms

Article 3 - where liberalism “succeeds,” explained by walter williams
(before it's news) the liberal political pathology that focuses on targeted groups is ultimately harmful to society. but no part of society is harmed more than the group liberalism pretends to be helping. its “favored” status turns into that of sacrificial lamb to be slaughtered on the altar of liberalism. walter williams uses the city of detroit to explain how this works: joann watson, detroit city council member, said, “our people in an overwhelming way supported the re-election of this president, and there ought to be a quid pro quo.” in other words, president obama should send the nearly bankrupted city of detroit millions in taxpayer bailout money. but there’s a painful lesson to be learned from decades of political hustling and counsel by intellectuals and urban experts. in 1960, detroit’s population was 1.6 million. blacks were 29 percent, and whites were 70 percent. today, detroit’s population has fallen precipitously to 707,000, of which blacks are 84 percent and whites 8 percent. much of the city’s decline began with the election of coleman young, detroit’s first black mayor and mayor for five terms, who engaged in political favoritism to blacks and tax policies against higher income mostly white people. young’s successors, dennis archer and kwame kilpatrick, followed his third world tyrant policies, but neither had his verbal vulgarity. kilpatrick (

Article 5 - it costs taxpayers millions to remove all these confederate statues
cities bowing to the political correctness of the times are finding out that catering to every whim of liberals is extremely expensive. in richmond, va the whole process of erasing pieces of american history could cost taxpayers around $$3 million every year. the monument avenue preservation society says that by removing the status, property values will go down by 10-20 percent, essentially also costing taxpayers $$3 million a year. san antonio, tx is in a battle within city hall about the overages they paid on what was supposed to cost the city around $$150,000 for a third party to remove some statues that ended up costing the city almost twice that. most of the overages were for police overtime and equipment required to keep the libs from causing harm to the statues, or further harm if you believe they should not have been moved from their resting place in the first place. dallas, tx incurred a bill for roughly half a million dollars to remove a statue of robert e. lee and they are even considering spending more to remove more statues. one of the statues dallas is considering moving is a giant monument built in 1896 that is estimated to come with an $$800,000 removal cost. dallas actually has an entire task for dedicated to the removal efforts of confederate statues in their city. some of dallas’ task force members have the view that if there were statues in hitler’s name that no amount of money would be too steep to have it removed. so

Article 6 - obama tries to turn another tragedy into political opportunity
obama tries to turn another tragedy into political opportunity (before it's news) on thursday night, 15-year-0ld zaevion dobson was murdered in knoxville, tennessee. the murder was both senseless and banal as most shooting deaths are. earlier in the evening another woman had been shot and wounded in an apparent gang-related attack. her son and a friend drove to the neighborhood where they believed the attacker(s) lived and carried out some random shootings. dobson was sitting on front porch of his home with a group of friends when the shooters rolled up; dobson stood between the shooters and his friends when the shooters opened fire. he was killed but his friends were able to escape. two men have been arrested, one of them, a convicted felon, has been charged with the murder. the story has two points. first, it underscores the different nature of gun deaths in predominantly black communities and white communities. the washington post ran a story headlined the shocking difference in how blacks and whites are killed by guns the day after martin was murdered. he wasn’t mentioned in the story but he would have been an apt metaphor for the point the story made: the gun control debate often plays out in monolithic fashion in this country. the traditional understanding is that there’s one overarching problem — gun violence — that can be addressed by a more or less uniform set of solutions: better background checks, improved technology, etc. this approach makes a lot of sense.

reforming local government in colorado springs (before it's news) after the great recession gut checked federal, state and local government budgets across the united states, many policymakers realized how vulnerable their budgets were to economic uncertainty. however, policymakers weren’t the only ones who noticed. in colorado springs, concerned citizen and president of the broadmoor hotel, steve bartolin, wrote a letter to then mayor lionel rivera criticizing the city’s unsustainable fiscal policy and lack of transparency. at the time, colorado springs faced two major long-term issues: first, unsustainable fiscal policy exacerbated by a lack of transparency; and second, burgeoning civil employee pension liabilities that are outside the control of local government (civil servants are part of the state’s public employee retirement association). these concerns, combined with citizen dissatisfaction, created a distrustful environment blocking meaningful government reform. bartolin’s letter ultimately served as a catalyst for the creation of the city committee in 2010. the city committee endeavors to apply best business practices, where appropriate, to improve the operations of colorado springs’ city government and its enterprises. its members offer city officials management consulting services in an effort to maximize the “return on investment” to the taxpayer. in this december 2011 interview with reason foundation’s harris kenny, chuck fowler, ceo and chairman of the city committee, discusses the formation of the organization, the changing structure of city government in colorado springs, and future government reform efforts in store for the

Article 1 - court observers learn stories behind new york’s jaywalkers and subway scufflers
the monitoring program has not coincidentally ramped up at a moment when violent crime in new york has reached historic lows. despite a recent uptick in homicides and shootings, the city’s crime rate remains remarkably far below its apex in the early 1990s and, in this atmosphere of relative security, the policy debate about policing has shifted away from felonies to less severe, quality-of-life crimes. in april, police commissioner william j. bratton issued a report, “broken windows and quality-of-life policing in new york city,” which defended cracking down on minor violations and argued that crime had decreased greatly in direct proportion to the issuances of summonses and misdemeanor arrests. one of his report’s key findings was that more than half of those brought up on misdemeanor charges in the city were potential recidivists with a prior record of more serious felony arrests. opposing mr. bratton that same month, melissa mark-viverito, the city council speaker, announced a proposal to decriminalize a host of small offenses, like public urination and being in a park after dark. and just three weeks ago, the brooklyn district attorney’s office held an amnesty day at a church in clinton hill, at which hundreds of people with outstanding warrants for petty violations were allowed — by simply showing up — to wipe them off the books. soon, mayor bill de blasio will join the conversation. in the coming weeks, he is expected to release his own plan about

Article 2 - detroit’s mayor will leave office and go to jail
“moving forward will require all of us to put aside the anger and bitterness of the past few months,” said mr. cockrel, 42, “and heal as a community.” mr. cockrel, whose father, a civil rights activist, died in 1989 before he could achieve his own mayoral aspirations and whose stepmother is a current council member, said chief among his responsibilities would be “restoring the credibility of not only the mayor but also of the city of detroit.” in an evening address from his office, an upbeat mr. kilpatrick took a parting swipe at ms. granholm. he also acknowledged what he called his “poor judgment,” asked the city to throw its support behind mr. cockrel and gave a litany of his achievements. “i want to emphasize tonight that i take full responsibility for my own actions,” he said. “i wish with all my heart that we could turn back the hands of time and tell that young man to make better choices. but i can’t. our challenge now is to put the anguish and turmoil of recent months behind us and join in a common cause to love our city, to love one another and move forward together.” police chief ella bully-cummings, a mayoral appointee, announced her retirement immediately after mr. kilpatrick’s plea, and a host of other city officials and staff members are expected to leave their jobs. it all adds up to a tremendous amount of tumult for a poverty-stricken

Article 3 - jersey city's new curfew starts, but with complaints
jersey city, n.j., march 27 - a business curfew aimed at cutting crime took effect in parts of jersey city on saturday night with nearly full compliance, the police said. but some businesses stayed open and vowed to fight the curfew in court. under the curfew, businesses in 135 blocks of the city, except bars and pharmacies, must close from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. but the detroit diner on martin luther king jr. drive remained open past 11. that defiance earned the restaurant's owner, nasir jumriyani, a citation that could result in a $1,250 fine and up to 90 days in jail. ""i want to go to court,"" mr. jumriyani screamed to several police officers, including the chief, robert troy. mr. jumriyani closed at 11:30 p.m., after serving fried chicken and french fries to a customer. he said that city officials wanted to shut him down. ""they don't want a decent restaurant,"" he said. chief troy said the curfew was needed to reduce the shootings, stabbings and vagrancy violations common in much of the curfew zones. advertisement continue reading the main story ""this is important because the community wants this violence to end,"" he said. ""i am convinced that by supporting our ordinance we'll see a drop in our violent crime rate.""

Article 4 - seattle’s mayor faces challenge, despite signs of success
photo seattle — mayor mike mcginn seems like the kind of candidate this city would love. a former sierra club chapter leader and an avid cyclist, he bikes to work from his home in north seattle. he has focused his campaign for a second term on issues voters care about here: climate change, transportation and reducing police brutality. and the economy is doing pretty well, with construction cranes whirring on the horizon and job numbers growing. but on the eve of election day, polls suggested that mr. mcginn was in trouble, running behind his challenger, a state senator seeking to become seattle’s first openly gay mayor. a recent poll by strategies 360 of 400 likely voters had the senator, ed murray, leading by 17 percentage points, with 51 percent of respondents supporting him. the poll, conducted oct. 14-16, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. mr. murray has run as problem-solver who agrees with mr. mcginn on many issues this overwhelmingly liberal city looks for. but he says mr. mcginn is too combative, having angered corporations and members of the nine-member city council, five of whom have endorsed mr. murray. he points in particular to the mayor’s handling of a complaint by the justice department in late 2011 accusing the seattle police department of racial insensitivity and using excessive force. mr. murray asserts that the mayor’s

Article 5 - violence flares in ferguson after appeals for harmony
after the initial barrage of tear gas, the police formed into ranks and moved down the street, pushing the protesters from the area. scattered clashes and violence had flared early sunday morning during the first hours of the curfew, which began at midnight and continued to 5 a.m. but the trouble sunday evening was a sharp contrast to the mood of the rest of the day. at churches across the area, ministers, the police and civil rights figures joined parishioners in trying to tamp down the anger that has followed the aug. 9 death of mr. brown, 18. in a packed sanctuary at greater grace church, not far from the site of evening demonstrations, capt. ronald s. johnson, the missouri state highway patrol official brought in by the governor to take over security here, spoke with the cadence of a preacher as he apologized to the family of the teenager. “my heart goes out to you, and i say that i’m sorry,” captain johnson said. “i wear this uniform, and i should stand up here and say that i’m sorry.” photo before a mostly black audience, captain johnson, who is african-american, spoke of his own “black son, who wears his pants saggy, wears his hat cocked to the side and has tattoos on his arms.” he added, “that’s my baby.” “michael’s going to make it better for our sons so they can be better black men,” he said,

Article 6 - blocking the transmission of violence
the stubborn core of violence in american cities is troubling and perplexing. even as homicide rates have declined across the country — in some places, like new york, by a remarkable amount — gunplay continues to plague economically struggling minority communities. for 25 years, murder has been the leading cause of death among african-american men between the ages of 15 and 34, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, which has analyzed data up to 2005. and the past few years have seen an uptick in homicides in many cities. since 2004, for instance, they are up 19 percent in philadelphia and milwaukee, 29 percent in houston and 54 percent in oakland. just two weekends ago in chicago, with the first warm weather, 36 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. the chicago sun-times called it the “weekend of rage.” many killings are attributed to gang conflicts and are confined to particular neighborhoods. in chicago, where on average five people were shot each day last year, 83 percent of the assaults were concentrated in half the police districts. so for people living outside those neighborhoods, the frequent outbursts of unrestrained anger have been easy to ignore. but each shooting, each murder, leaves a devastating legacy, and a growing school of thought suggests that there’s little we can do about the entrenched urban poverty if the relentless pattern of street violence isn’t somehow broken. the traditional response has been more focused

Article 7 - chicago makes another effort to disrupt gangs
''it's a good thing, but at the same time it doesn't solve the root of the problem,'' said sister rayo cuaya-castillo of holy trinity croatian church, a half-block from 18th and throop. sister cuaya-castillo said that after the arrests, gang members returned to the corner and there was shooting that night and the next. ultimately, she said, gangs might ''move to another neighborhood'' but ''they will continue to do the same thing.'' under the old anti-loitering ordinance, ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court last year, the police arrested more than 42,000 people. that measure made it a crime for anyone standing with a suspected gang member to ''remain in any one place with no apparent purpose'' after a police order to disperse. ''it matters not,'' wrote justice john paul stevens in the 6-to-3 opinion that struck down the ordinance, ''whether the reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near wrigley field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of sammy sosa leaving the ballpark.'' newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an

Article 8 - philadelphia defends policy on frisking, with limits
yet finding the right balance has not been easy. city officials have watched in frustration as homicides have continued to climb. as of late tuesday, 189 people had been killed in the city this year, compared with 169 at the same time in 2011. in most cases, police commissioner charles h. ramsey said, both the victims and the perpetrators have been black or hispanic men. “i think we have to face some realities,” said commissioner ramsey, who is black. “we certainly do not want to be stopping people without the reasonable suspicion that we need to conduct a stop. but just because someone is complaining and they want to play the race card doesn’t mean it’s an inappropriate stop.” the total number of stops, he said, is not the issue. “the question is: are you stopping the right people for the right reason?” philadelphia, like new york, increased the use of the stop-and-frisk tactic, arguing that it would help remove guns from the streets and serve as a deterrent. in his 2007 mayoral campaign, mr. nutter promised to use the strategy to help combat a “crime emergency” in some neighborhoods. that year, police officers made 136,711 pedestrian stops. two years after mr. nutter was elected, in 2009, the number nearly doubled to 253,276 — higher proportionally, in a city of 1.5 million, than the 685,724 stops made

Title: detroit sweats while it waits for electricity
Content: ''the party has to happen in your homes tonight,'' the mayor said at an afternoon news conference outside police headquarters in the eerily quiet and empty downtown. ''continue your family time. love thy neighbor -- in your own home, your own neighborhood.'' thrilled that the number of arrests was at a typical level through the first 24 hours of the nation's worst blackout, detroit officials said the weekend would serve as a referendum on mayor kilpatrick's leadership and on his efforts to rehabilitate detroit's reputation, from that of a city decimated by violence and poverty to that of a cultural hub with a revitalized economy. ''either the people of this city believe in this city's future and are going to rally around this mayor or they're not,'' said michael duggan, the county prosecutor, who stood with mr. kilpatrick and mr. oliver at the news conference. although city officials said there had been virtually no violence or looting thursday night or friday, mr. duggan issued a stern warning to residents of a city still scarred from the riots of the 1960's. noting that civil disobedience felonies carry a 10-year prison term, mr. duggan added, ''before you pick up a brick and throw it, before you tip over a car, before you take a tv, you better ask yourself, is this worth 10 years of my life?'' elsewhere in the midwest, gov. bob taft of ohio declared a state of emergency in cuyahoga county, which includes cleveland, where an order to boil the city's water was in effect through sunday, though power had been restored by midafternoon to nearly all the 1.5 million area residents who had lost it and to the city's four water pumping stations. in akron, power was restored in all but a four-block area by 11 a.m., and the mayor sent water and engineers to help cleveland. neighboring cuyahoga falls, population 50,000, never lost power. ''it was almost like when you land in las vegas and see all the lights,'' the mayor, don robart, said of driving home to cuyahoga falls from akron, in a telephone call to national public radio. ''it was nice to come home to.'' in melvindale, mich., a detroit suburb, 2,000 people were shut out of their homes until 1:35 p.m., after an explosion at an oil refinery on thursday night caused by a buildup of pressure inside a boiler. it appeared unrelated to the blackout but compounded the misery. advertisement continue reading the main story across the region the blackout caused all sorts of disruptions and inconvenience and prompted a variety of improvised remedies. at st. joseph mercy hospital in ann arbor, mich., robert moore, a courier, got stuck in traffic while trying to pick up platelets for a cancer patient. he

Article 1 - carmelo anthony leads knicks to victory over celtics
carmelo anthony leads knicks to victory over celtics % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) new york knicks forward carmelo anthony secured one of the most satisfying victories of his career against the boston celtics, leading his team to an 89-86 road win at the td garden. the knicks’ 89-86 triumph thursday night snapped their 11-game losing streak at boston and also was a measure of revenge for a defeat against the celtics at madison square garden on jan. 7, when anthony jawed both on and off the court with veteran kevin garnett and earned himself a one-game suspension. the teams’ latest meeting was a shenanigan-free, defensive-minded contest that was not decided until late in the fourth quarter, when the celtics shot themselves in the foot with turnovers on two of their last three possessions. anthony led the way for the knicks with 28 points, his 27th straight game with at least 20 points dating back to nov. 16. the star forward, who was booed throughout the night by the celtics’ fans, also hauled down nine rebounds. in the teams’ previous game, anthony was so rattled by garnett’s trash-talking that he waited outside the celtics’ bus after the contest in a bid to continue his war of words with

nba lockout complete, so are the celtics’ chances (before it's news) at this point, it seems as though the nba season is going to be a complete air ball. while nba fans from every market are disappointed, confused, and seriously contemplating joining the occupy movement, i think that boston celtic’s fans have a reason to be particularly disappointed. this is the end of the celtic’s as we’ve come to know them. while it’s hard for many to remember, before 2007 and the formulation of the big three, the celtics had squandered miserable season after miserable season away under the watchful eye of the garden’s championship banners. paul pierce offered some relief (god bless him for sticking around), but mostly we tuned in to watch antoine walker jack up countless threes. in 2007, danny ainge teamed up with paul pierce, ray allen, and kevin garnett to change all that. rajon rondo also joined the mix. a championship banner suddenly landed in the rafters, and expectations have been high ever since. i’ve said all along that this group is too good to have only won a single championship together, as they missed out on their second by blowing a 13-point lead to the lakers in the 4th quarter of the 2009-2010 nba finals. this year, i’ll argue, could have been the year. trust

new york — with the new york knicks’ hot start to the season, knicks fans are asking, “jeremy who?” knicks fans were recently asked how the excitement of this season’s beginning compares to the ‘linsanity’ of last season. it’s clear that jeremy lin is an out-of-reach memory in the minds of knicks fans. one hundred percent of knicks fans surveyed didn’t know what ‘linsanity’ meant, while twenty-one percent thought the interviewer just had a stroke. “who gives a shit about last season? we’ve been kicking ass this season!” said one excited fan. “jeremy lin?” responded another fan. “doesn’t ring a bell. he couldn’t be more entertaining than rasheed wallace though i bet! have you see him lug his way down the court? you never know if he’s gonna make it!” lin started his first nba game for the knicks in february of last season. he became a new york hero and nationwide phenomenon out of nowhere, recording one of the greatest starts to a career in nba history. but after failing to arrive at agreeable terms with knicks management this past off-season, lin signed with the houston rockets. his season has started very shaky, performing nowhere near his level of play last season. for many knicks fans, the disappointing end to last season seemed to have had a damaging effect to its charm. season-ticket holder eric bridgeman admits

catfish fry: pierce, c’s drop cavs (before it's news) it was a typical night for the cavaliers wednesday in boston’s td garden. playing without the injuried anderson varejao and displaying its usual slipshod effort on both sides of the ball, cleveland dropped to 5-22 on the season with a 103-91 loss to the celtics. it was the fifth straight defeat for the cavaliers, who fell to 1-10 in the month of december. the game plan for cleveland on this night seemingly featured a determination to not guard paul pierce. apparently no one on the cavaliers either a.) studied film of the celtics or b.) watched an nba game after 1998. either way, the catfish was given one wide-open look after another, and he responded with a season-high 40 points on 13-of-16 from the field and 6-of-7 from downtown. pierce led the way to a scorching offensive night from the celtics, who got off at a 59.7 percent clip against cleveland’s lackluster-as-usual defense. source:

boston — a fifth straight defeat, even at home to the hated knicks, somehow seemed almost preordained for what remains of the boston celtics these days. coach doc rivers drew up his 17th starting lineup tuesday night — and then watched his injury-ravaged team drop a 100-85 decision to the knicks, the celtics’ 11th — and worst — home defeat of the season. the celtics were massacred on the offensive glass, turned the ball over twice as often as the knicks, and, as rivers saw it, showed no sense of urgency or even competitive fire in what once loomed as a big game. “it certainly meant a lot to them,” rivers said of the knicks who, after having not won in boston for five years, took both td garden games this season. “you could see it. you could feel their emotion.” and the celtics? pfft. “i think our energy was down,” jeff green said. the celtics long ago came to the realization that their five-year run as the atlantic division champions was coming to an end. they also have come to the conclusion that they will make the playoffs; they are in seventh place and well ahead (nine games in the loss column) of the ninth-place philadelphia 76ers. advertisement continue reading the main story so the mission statement for the last month has been to get everyone as healthy as possible

""i have nothing to say to him. it ain't personal with me, on my end,"" anthony told reporters before scoring 31 points in saturday's 118-107 loss to the raptors. ""i don't have anything to say to him. he refs. i'll play. i'll keep my mouth shut next time."" brothers ejected anthony with successive technicals for arguing in the second quarter of friday night's blowout loss to the celtics, not long before la la sent out multiple tweets on the subject.

Article 4 - new arena, different result for the knicks in miami
alonzo mourning did exactly what his team needed. he did not take pity on his mentor, patrick ewing. he did not think twice about how ewing spent his idle moments on the bench today wrapped in a heating pad for his tight back. he did not freeze at the moment he had a late-game encounter with his boyhood hero. mourning slipped to a spot outside the paint. and with ewing laboring to reach him 17 feet from the basket, mourning rose off the floor and sent up a soft jumper that was nestled by the net with 5.6 seconds on the clock to pad the heat's lead and close out the scoring. with 41.8 seconds left, mourning had broken an 83-83 tie when he got the ball deep in the post and put in a layup past ewing. ''you have to admire patrick's attitude and his determination,'' said mourning, who led the heat with 26 points and helped hold the ailing but able ewing to 17. ''that's one of the things i've admired about him over the years, from watching him play at the age of 12. a lot of him has rubbed off on me. he's the reason i approach the game the way i do.'' the heat approached this game with desperation. the knicks arrived with an air of arrogance that did not wear very well. it is as if they thought the game would simply come to them in the end -- because it

Article 5 - knicks aren’t perfect, but the result is
the emotions were more raw for the celtics, who opened the playoffs in the shadow of the boston marathon bombings and the manhunt that followed. “i think emotionally, it could go either way,” coach doc rivers said before tip-off. every celtics jersey was adorned with a patch reading, “boston stands as one.” in an unusual gesture, paul pierce and anthony addressed the crowd before the game, with anthony conveying “our prayers and our condolences” and pierce declaring, “boston will rise and run again.” a small number of fans booed pierce as he took the microphone, but they were quickly shushed and drowned out by a much larger contingent. color guard units from the boston and new york fire departments jointly presented the american flag for the national anthem. a brief chant of “u-s-a!” followed, which quickly gave way to “let’s go, knicks!” as a playoff normalcy settled in. anthony was sometimes erratic, going 13 for 29 from the field against a relentless boston defense, but he hit two jumpers to put the knicks ahead for good in the fourth quarter, and added a steal and a fast-break layup to hold off the celtics in the final minutes. j. r. smith added 15 points, and raymond felton had 10. the rest was done with defense, which has not exactly been the knicks’ calling card this season. they

Article 6 - knicks come alive and rally past cavaliers
somewhere in between lie the reasons for a 25-39 record. and what would be a cry for celebration in chicago still remains an indictment in new york. but the knicks are showing signs of the team they might have been. ''if we don't get the playoff spot, we still want to finish playing as if we're playing for a playoff spot,'' allan houston said, moments after making all five of his 3-point attempts and finishing with a game-high 28 points. jackson outplayed the younger and quicker andre miller, cleveland's floor leader. if miller came in with a right hip pointer, he left with a severely bruised ego. aside from being unable to thwart jackson, miller was in foul trouble all evening and finished only 3 of 10 from the field with 10 points and 11 assists. he let his frustration get the best of him, picking up a technical in the final minutes. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. with 1 minute 30 seconds left, cleveland coach john lucas was ejected by referee tim donaghy after receiving

Article 7 - pistons slip past holes in knicks' defense
just over a minute earlier, the knicks had been able to lean on patrick ewing, of all aging superstars, to lift the pall off the team. worn from plodding through their second game in two nights and heavy with emotions after learning that charlotte's bobby phills had died earlier today in a car accident, the knicks were looking for some inspiration. this time, ewing did what he could. unlike last week's back-to-back-game situation, he did not sit in the fourth quarter, but stood up and remembered his lines from the old days. he was dominating again. ewing scored 12 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and helped cut the pistons' lead -- which had ballooned as big as 15 points late in the third quarter -- to 93-91 with five minutes left. ''it's disappointing,'' ewing said. ''we were right there.'' quickly, the pistons sent double-teams to harass ewing and finished off an aggressive game with a steady waltz to the free-throw line. in all, the pistons went 39 times to the knicks' 9. in all, the pistons just had too much quickness for the languid knicks, whose league-best defense gave up 50 percent from the field and allowed detroit's trifecta -- hunter, stackhouse and grant hill -- to score 29 points each. newsletter sign up continue reading the main

Title: adding the fire to a simmering feud
Content: of course, even without the anthony-garnett issue to consider, a celtics-knicks contest is never just another game, especially in a season in which the knicks are resurgent and threatening to end boston’s primacy in the atlantic division. photo but beyond that, who knows? the celtics’ crowd can be a tough one, but no tougher than some others in the n.b.a. and not any more likely to jump on an opposing player. what is part of the record, though, is that one of anthony’s teammates, jason kidd, received very tough treatment in boston during the 2002 postseason. then the point guard and leader of a vibrant new jersey nets team, kidd heard chants of “wife beater” from celtics fans, who were intent on delivering a nasty reminder that kidd, nearly a year and a half earlier, had been arrested on a charge of spousal abuse involving his wife, joumana, to whom he is no longer married. joumana kidd was in attendance in boston as the shouts came from the stands. so was their son, t. j., who was then 3. it was a tough scene, an ugly one, and when kidd and the nets prevailed in game 4 in boston to even the series at two games apiece, he defiantly celebrated on the court, staring into the crowd and holding up two fingers on each hand to remind the fans the series was tied. afterward, he admitted to having shouted profanities, too. when asked about that incident this week, kidd said: “no matter what they scream or what is done, you have to go out and play. if you have rabbit ears, it may get to you, but if you don’t, it’s just another game on the road.” referring to anthony and what might await him in boston on thursday, kidd added: “he’s one of the top players in the world. he’s been heckled on the road before, in college and now in the n.b.a. it’s nothing new.” advertisement continue reading the main story chuck mckenney, a co-founder of redsarmy.com, a celtics fan web site, predicted that boston fans would boo anthony during introductions on thursday night, when he went to the free-throw line, when he had the ball and when he did not. photo “we don’t have a lot of respect for melo,” mckenney said in a telephone interview. “we kind of feel like he’s always been a second-tier superstar, overpaid, not really capable of carrying a team to a championship. “but just because we want to dismiss him doesn’t mean we’re not going to come out with a lot of vitriol and just let him have it.” on the other hand, anthony might be a bigger target than ever for celt

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The Boston Celtics have struggled with injuries and a lack of competitive fire, leading to five straight defeats. Coach Doc Rivers has drawn up 17 different starting lineups this season, but the team's energy remains down. The Knicks, on the other hand, have been motivated by their desire to beat the Celtics at home.

Carmelo Anthony has vowed to keep quiet around referee Tony Brothers, who ejected him from a game due to successive technicals. LaLa Anthony defended her husband on Twitter, stating that Brothers has a personal vendetta against Melo.

The Knicks' Alonzo Mourning led the Heat to a win over the Celtics, with 26 points and a dominant performance in the fourth quarter. Patrick Ewing helped hold off the Heat's lead, but ultimately fell short.

In another game, the Knicks came alive and rallied past the Cavaliers, with Allan Houston scoring 28 points and outplaying Andre Miller. The Pistons also beat the Knicks, with Charlie Grant Hill dominating the team with 29 points.

The Nets got revenge on the Celtics after a blowout loss, winning 111-101 at home. Brook Lopez had 23 points and 10 rebounds, while Jarrett Jack scored 22 points in the fourth quarter.

letters in gun debate, the sides aren’t equal image credit rob kerr/agence france-presse — getty images to the editor: re “some inconvenient gun facts for liberals” (column, jan. 17): nicholas kristof may be just a bit naïve when he argues that our failure to address gun violence is partly because liberals antagonize gun owners and empower the national rifle association. i have been a student of and an advocate for the sensible regulation of firearms since 1968, when i served as assistant to the chairman of the national commission on the causes and prevention of violence. appointed by president lyndon b. johnson after the assassinations of robert f. kennedy and martin luther king jr. in 1968, the commission conducted a landmark study of gun ownership and gun violence. i learned, as has everyone who has seriously worked to solve the gun problem, that the national rifle association’s strategy has always been and always will be “give ’em an inch and they’ll take a mile.” the n.r.a. has consistently reacted with full force to even the most modest proposals, claiming that any regulation will result in the confiscation of all firearms. the n.r.a. doesn’t have to convince gun owners that its policies and actions are right; it just has to keep writing checks to members of congress. ron wolk warwick, r.i. to the editor: nicholas kristof suggests that the left drop the sanctimony and the

airstrike kills at least 25 at market in yemen image yemenis gathered on wednesday to survey the damage to the market in sada province. credit naif rahma/reuters sana, yemen — an airstrike at a busy street market in northern yemen has killed at least 25 civilians and wounded at least nine, yemeni health officials said on wednesday. the attack late tuesday destroyed a building in the center of a market in the northern province of sada, the heartland of the shiite rebels known as houthis. the health officials said children were among the victims. the houthis, backed by iran, have controlled much of the country since 2014, when they overthrew the internationally recognized government of president abdu rabbu mansour hadi. an arab coalition led by saudi arabia and supported by the united states is fighting to restore that government. the conflict has killed an estimated 10,000 people and displaced at least three million, and the united nations now describes yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. the health officials said the airstrike on tuesday had probably been carried out by the arab coalition. saudi arabia has been bombing yemen since march 2015. in a statement carried by saudi arabia’s official news agency, the arab coalition said that it would investigate the attack to determine whether it had played a role in the episode, and that

review: chris janson, with ‘buy me a boat,’ separates himself from bro-country genre image chris janson’s full-length debut album, “buy me a boat.” chris janson “buy me a boat” (warner bros./warner music nashville) chris janson’s “buy me a boat” is a working-class anthem, a bone-dry, heavily drawled shrug about the downside of wage labor. it’s also wry: “they call me redneck, white trash and blue collar/but i could change all that if i had a couple million dollars.” in the modern country context — denuded accents, love songs, winks to pop and hip-hop — it feels practically heretical. mr. janson was between labels when he released “buy me a boat”; it first gained attention when the influential and disruptive radio d.j. bobby bones played it on his show. and yet it went as high as no. 2 on the billboard country chart, a novelty that became something more. that means that mr. janson might be nashville’s first viable post-bro. in the genre’s perpetual arm wrestle over values, “buy me a boat” feels like the beginning of a comeback for rural-minded country. mr. janson’s impressive full-length debut album, titled after his breakthrough hit, is an extension of that promise, from the rambunctious “power of positive drinkin

Meanwhile, former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley has announced his candidacy for President in 2016, framing the election as a dire economic issue. He argues that income inequality is making it harder for Americans to save for retirement and send children to college.

it’s not a slowdown — it’s a virtual work stoppage. nypd traffic tickets and summonses for minor offenses have dropped off by a staggering 94 percent following the execution of two cops — as officers feel betrayed by the mayor and fear for their safety, the post has learned. some officers, who say they are angry with the de blasio administration for not supporting them, are slowing down on the job, reported the ny post. the dramatic drop comes as police commissioner bill bratton and mayor bill de blasio plan to hold an emergency summit on tuesday with the heads of the five police unions to try to close the widening rift between cops and the administration. the days following the dec. 20 shooting of nypd officers rafael ramos and wenjian liu have been characterized by increasingly strained relations between new york city mayor bill de blasio and the city’s police force. nypd officers have repeatedly turned their backs on de blasio during speaking engagements, even at the funeral for the two officers. protesters have also become involved in the rift between the city’s law enforcement and its head political office. according to a report from the new york post, arrests for low-level offenders have also been affected by the murder of the two officers. in the days since that incident, nypd tickets and arrests for minor offenses have dropped 94 percent. while the low arrest levels could be attributed to the holiday season, overall arrests are actually down 66 percent

Article 1 - bill de blasio for mayor
the rise of bill de blasio, new york city’s public advocate, has been remarkable. in a clamorous primary campaign against better known, more seasoned candidates, he won the democratic nomination without a runoff, by appealing directly and doggedly to struggling new yorkers who see a city of lofty wealth rising out of their reach. with the election only 10 days away, mr. de blasio is polling so far ahead of the republican, joseph lhota, that commentators have already anointed him leader of a national rebirth of left-wing populism. hold on. we’re electing a mayor here, someone to keep streets plowed and safe, budgets balanced, schools working well and constituents of five boroughs satisfied. someone to sustain and build on the 12-year legacy of michael bloomberg, while realizing his own vision for new york. it’s a huge job, never mind the revolution. luckily, mr. de blasio is up for it. during the democratic primary scramble, the largest and most rancorous in decades, we gave our endorsement to christine quinn, citing her record as the city council speaker. but it was mr. de blasio who proved far better at connecting with voters — and at being a persuasive advocate for his ideas. the ideas are good ones: mr. de blasio is right on public safety, and on the need to rein in the police department’s unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk tactics and restore its frayed ties

Article 2 - de blasio returning to the national political stage
for some democrats, the forum may highlight a sore point: mr. de blasio has continued to withhold an endorsement of his former boss and a fellow democrat, hillary rodham clinton. the mayor said on cnbc this week that mrs. clinton still needs “to fill in the blanks” on some policy plans before he can support her presidential bid. even some of the mayor’s close supporters have wondered why he is delaying an endorsement. but staying neutral could help mr. de blasio attract more candidates to the planned presidential forum in indianola, iowa, which he plans to sponsor with representative david loebsack, an iowa democrat. so far, senator bernie sanders, an independent from vermont, and martin o’malley, a democratic candidate from maryland, have expressed interest in participating. a representative for mrs. clinton did not respond to an inquiry on wednesday. city hall officials say that with a presidential election looming, mr. de blasio cares deeply about focusing the political dialogue on policies that he believes can help combat inequality, like eliminating tax loopholes for the income of some investment managers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred

Article 3 - donald trump in new york: deep roots, but little influence
donald trump in new york: deep roots, but little influence image donald j. trump’s organization manages the wollman ice skating rink in central park. credit edward caruso for the new york times it is impossible to miss when you fly into new york city and spot the golf course in the shadow of the whitestone bridge. it is hard to avoid when you stroll along fifth avenue, or venture past the skating rink or carousel in central park. and it is there in bright lights, no less, when you pass the sleek hotel near the entrance to the holland tunnel: the name of donald j. trump. mr. trump has embraced his roots as a new yorker as being crucial to his presidential bid, and in so doing, the republican candidate has given the impression as he crossed the country that he is a force to reckon with in the city of his birth. but while trump remains a visible brand name around the city’s five boroughs, it is much harder to discern his imprint as a classic power broker, someone who is feared and can make things happen with a phone call or a quiet aside with the right person at the right time. his real estate holdings in new york are modest; he did not make the top 10 in lists of major condominium developers and power players in real estate in the city, as judged by several publications. he does not belong to trade groups like the real estate board of new york or the association for a better new york.

Article 4 - de blasio goes stumping in quinn country
photo an increasingly confident bill de blasio on friday ventured into the home territory of one of his main rivals, campaigning at christine c. quinn’s neighborhood subway stop. mr. de blasio, a democratic candidate for mayor, was mobbed by chelsea residents who wanted to shake his hand and take pictures of him with their children. “now i can say i’ve met the mayor,” one boy said. a man gushed about how he had just been telling some women on the bus that mr. de blasio, the public advocate, was going to win the election. “i took out my crystal ball, and i see that you will become mayor,” he said, laughing. ms. quinn, the city council speaker, and william c. thompson jr., the city comptroller and another democratic candidate, spent friday concentrating on rallying their bases — ms. quinn with a boisterous rally at the stonewall inn, and mr. thompson with a series of appearances in the bronx. at the same time, mr. de blasio seemed to be trying to expand his base, and with an unrelenting focus on ms. quinn. advertisement continue reading the main story his appearance at ms. quinn’s local subway stop, at west 23rd street and eighth avenue, came hours after capital new york published on its web site a video showing mr. de blasio putting his arm around a man wearing a red t-shirt that

Article 6 - de blasio reacts as mayor and a father
unlike peers in city and state government who also spoke on wednesday, mr. de blasio did not explicitly denounce the grand jury’s decision in the garner case. and he did not demand a federal investigation of the case, saying only that “there are more chapters ahead.” but he cited the rallying cry of protesters across the country — “black lives matter” — in a manner that signaled his tacit support. “they said it because it has to be said,” he said. “it’s a phrase that should never have to be said. it should be self-evident, but our history sadly requires us to say it.” mr. de blasio’s rhetorical strength is an ability to project empathy, and as he spoke for 20 minutes on wednesday, flanked by clergy leaders and elected officials, he seemed to be trying to preside over the day’s events, rather than to steer them. he acknowledged there would be protests, and urged new yorkers to avoid violence. he praised william j. bratton, his police commissioner, as an agent of change, but — aware that some liberals are skeptical of mr. bratton’s approach — also said that mr. bratton would not abide brutality or racism on the force. mr. de blasio began preparing his speech over the weekend, dictating general ideas and specific phrases to senior staff members, aides said. he chose to focus on his son because it was consistent with the personal approach

de blasio expresses city’s fears in meeting with trump instead of lecturing president-elect donald trump on wednesday, mayor de blasio should’ve been taking lessons: the nation’s incoming leader, amid the vital work of transition planning, took the time to . . . listen to a prominent critic. the mayor, by contrast, only sits down with people who disagree with him if they have more power. de blasio’s habitual contempt for those he imagines will never be on his side came through loud and clear in his press conference after the trump tower tête-à-tête. asked about the massive gridlock and stifling security on the site, which has area merchants in despair, he tossed off this gem: “i will not tell you that gucci and tiffany are my central concerns in life.” how about the people who work in those stores, mr. mayor? the ones worried about their jobs? you think they’re the 1 percent? this comes on top of his dismissal of the fifth avenue problem last week. “the holidays are coming anyway. midtown is going to be all messed up anyway,” he told reporters. “we’re talking about the next few months, and then donald trump is going to be living in the white house.” “all messed up anyway”? holiday shopping is what keeps even high-end retailers in the black. if the stores stay empty because de blasio’s too blasé to find a solution, those jobs could be out the door

Article 8 - giuliani campaign says donors gave $12 million in 1999
the mayor, a republican, did hold fund-raising events in new york, and his aides said yesterday that the campaign had received donations from all of the state's 62 counties. but the surprise was its ability to reach out to contributors outside new york; campaign officials displayed several cartons of letters at a news conference yesterday -- responses to solicitations intended to take advantage of anger toward the clintons among republicans around the nation. a quick search of one of the boxes found letters from kansas city, mo., wilmington, del., and cincinnati, but not new york. mr. giuliani's advisers would not say what percentage of the money came from direct mail, but they suggested that they had been stunned by their success at raising money outside the state. they also maintained that some of the checks had come from non-new yorkers appreciative of the mayor's performance. ''we have an aggressive direct mail operation,'' said bruce j. teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager. ''it's been our experience that a significant portion of contributions that we receive through direct mail are generated by the positive feelings that people have for new york after visiting here, and they credit the mayor for the turnaround.'' mr. teitelbaum said the campaign had received 90,000 donations, with an average of $110 each, asserting that those figures were evidence that mr. giuliani was conducting a grass-roots fund-raising effort. newsletter sign up continue reading the

Title: de blasio campaigns less as quinn steps up her pace
Content: for most of the summer, bill de blasio maintained a robust public appearance schedule as he ran across new york city in an attempt to meet voters. on an average day, mr. de blasio could be found greeting commuters at subway stations in the morning, visiting with people at senior centers during lunch and holding news conferences later in the day to introduce initiatives or proposals he would follow as mayor. but as the summer winds down and the democratic primary on sept. 10 draws near, mr. de blasio has sharply reduced his scheduled public appearances, just as his rivals, most notably christine c. quinn, the city council speaker, make a last-ditch effort to close the growing margin in the polls that he enjoys. mr. de blasio, who averaged 35 to 40 public events per week since mid-july, has made only 9 public appearances since monday, with no campaign appearances on friday. his campaign denied any change in practice. “bill de blasio has been out talking to voters and taking questions from the media every single day for months, and that will continue through election day and beyond,” said dan levitan, a spokesman for the de blasio campaign. by contrast, ms. quinn held 41 scheduled public appearances between monday and friday, more than in any other week in the past two months, according to an analysis of her campaign and council calendars. william c. thompson jr., who is vying with mr. de blasio and ms. quinn for one of the two spots in a possible runoff, held 22 events during the same window. ms. quinn held a five-borough tour on monday in honor of women’s equality day and brought out her father, lawrence p. quinn, to campaign with her at senior centers throughout the week. she even made it to the bay terrace community alliance’s annual candidate forum on tuesday, after being chided earlier this month for her lack of appearances at community mayoral forums compared with the other major democratic candidates. “if you want to be mayor, you need to make your case to the people you want to represent,” said mike morey, spokesman for the quinn campaign. “from now until election day, christine quinn intends to continuing doing just that, making the case if you want a progressive mayor who can deliver, she’s your gal.”

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers have been experiencing a significant decrease in ticket and arrest rates following the execution of two officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. The drop is attributed to feelings of betrayal among officers towards Mayor Bill de Blasio and concerns for their safety. This has led to a virtual work stoppage, with some officers slowing down on the job.

Meanwhile, former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley has announced his candidacy for President in 2016, framing the election as a dire economic issue. He argues that income inequality is making it harder for Americans to save for retirement and send children to college.

In other news, Democratic Party Chairman Reince Priebus has urged unity among Republicans behind presumptive nominee Donald Trump. However, some have expressed concerns about uniting behind a candidate who has shown little interest in conservative principles.

Additionally, David Catania, an independent candidate running for Mayor of Washington D.C., has been gaining support from Democrats. His campaign strategy focuses on appealing to Democratic voters and offering job training programs.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has offered mental health counseling to municipal workers distressed by the election of Donald Trump. This move comes as some Americans have reported feeling anxious or overwhelmed by the outcome.

Finally, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was ruled ineligible to run for Mayor of Chicago due to residency requirements. His case will be appealed to the Illinois State Supreme Court.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Bill de Blasio, the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, has been polling ahead in the election. He won the Democratic primary without a runoff and is seen as a leader of left-wing populism. De Blasio's ideas include public safety reform and reducing police department's unconstitutional use of stop-and-frisk tactics.

De Blasio has continued to withhold an endorsement for Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, citing her need to fill in policy plans. He plans to sponsor a presidential forum in Iowa with Representative David Loebsack.

Donald Trump's influence in New York City is limited despite his roots in the city. His real estate holdings are modest, and he does not belong to trade groups like the Real Estate Board of New York.

De Blasio campaigned in Christine Quinn's neighborhood, meeting with residents and trying to expand his base. He also reacted to the Garner case, citing ""black lives matter"" without explicitly denouncing the grand jury's decision.

John Catsimatidis is considering a run against de Blasio in 2017, citing his desire to help people and make streets safe. De Blasio has been criticized for his handling of the Trump meeting, dismissing concerns about holiday shopping and job security.

The Giuliani campaign received $12 million in donations from outside New York State in 1999, with letters from contributors across the country.

Article 2 - light show that fizzled
like eager paparazzi, astronomers trained an arsenal of telescopes this spring on the milky way’s crowded center, hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch an immense gas cloud collide with the galaxy’s supermassive black hole. the shock generated when the cloud smashed into gas surrounding the black hole, 26,000 light-years from earth, could have produced radio waves, x-rays and a possible brightening of infrared light. but researchers saw nothing. new observations of the cloud, known as g2 — along with a neighboring gas cloud, g1, that passed close to the black hole 13 years ago — have led astronomers to an intriguing explanation for the light show that wasn’t. stefan gillessen of the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching, germany, and his colleagues found that g1 and g2 have identical orbits that lie in the same plane as that of young stars near the milky way’s center. the team suggests that both clouds, along with a gas tail that appears to be trailing g2, are all part of a stream of gas that gravity ripped from the envelope of a young star about 100 years earlier. like rocks carried by a swift current, the clouds may be dense lumps embedded in the moving gas stream. there may be additional lumps in the tail that could serve as future snacks for the black hole, known as sagittarius a*. that interpretation is open for debate. but

Article 4 - is everything about to change? the first of four blood moons occurs april 15
astronomical events have been making headlines lately. on april 8, the orbits of mars, earth, and the sun fell into a straight line in a rare cosmic alignment called an opposition. precisely one week later, we will see the first of four extremely unusual total lunar eclipses. is there any significance to these extraordinary celestial events? could it be that god is using the sun, moon, and stars to communicate with us and to announce things to come? the answer is yes! the bible is clear that the sun, moon, and stars are connected to israel and biblical prophecy. throughout history god has used the science of astronomy (never astrology!) in connection with historical events to write prophetic messages in the heavens. one significant way god reveals coming events is through a phenomenon that scientists call ""blood moons."" these are total lunar eclipses in which the moon appears to be blood red. the coming message from god is so urgent that he is going to sovereignly arrange the sun and the moon to perfectly align themselves to create not just one blood moon, but a tetrad-a series of four consecutive blood moons! nasa has projected that the next tetrad will begin on april 15, 2014 and end on september 28, 2015. it will occur in the following sequence: 1. passover-april 15, 2014 2. feast of tabernacles-october 8, 2014 3. passover-april

Ted Cruz has also made headlines for his comments on ""New York values,"" which he described as socially liberal or pro-abortion. He has been criticized for disparaging New Yorkers and has faced backlash from the public.

In a debate, Donald Trump acknowledged that he was bringing up Ted Cruz's Canadian birthplace to boost his own polls, but Cruz deftly swatted away the taunts. Despite this, Cruz remains committed to his presidential campaign and believes he will win fair and square.","Key points:

* Ted Cruz's high evangelical turnout in the Iowa caucus is attributed to his ability to ""awaken"" and ""energize"" Christian conservative voters.
* Jeb Bush, a Catholic, emphasizes the importance of his faith guiding him as a public leader and has championed faith-based social services.
* 38 members of Congress urge Secretary of State John Kerry to use every legal means to rescue Meriam Ibrahim, a Christian mother sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to renounce her faith.

Article 1 - rafael cruz blames carly fiorina for son ted cruz’s “failure to become president”
dallas, tx – speaking recently at the texas gop’s convention, carly fiorina announced, “i am endorsing – for senate, in 2018, ted cruz.” the texas native-turned-californian tech executive, who cruz tapped as his unofficial running mate after she was vanquished from the presidential race and before he followed suit, was joined by rafael cruz, the texas senator’s preacher father, in not endorsing trump at the freedom, faith & fellowship rally at the state party’s biennial convention in dallas. however, when cruz senior took the mic, he turned his crosshairs towards fiorina and unexpectedly started blasting away. “it is said that the true measure of a man is not in him being a victor, but rather in his ability to withstand defeat and come back even stronger. i can say that i am proud of my son ted no matter what, and you better believe he is coming back guns blazing,” rafael cruz started off, followed by applause and whistles of approval. “however,” he continued, “i can’t say that i am proud of every single choice he has made in the past weeks and months. he has made mistakes, we all have, but the biggest one by far is opting to allow this woman, a failed executive of a once great company, a backdoor shot at her own, selfish goals. he has thus caused his own demise and has deprived himself of what is likely a once

Article 2 - ted cruz and the 54 million evangelicals
ted cruz and the 54 million evangelicals (before it's news) “”in this last election 54 million evangelicals stayed home,” asserted cruz on tuesday. “if we can simply bring christians to the polls, is it any wonder that we have the government we have, we have the leaders we have, if believers stay home and leave electing our leaders to unbelievers? we get exactly what we deserve.” christianpost i’ve enjoyed the last few days of our readers defining my political positioning, though i am afraid that some of the erudite comments are rather misleading. i am a conservative libertarian constitutionalist, or a constitutionally conservative libertarian, or some variance thereof. i’m also a christian and unlike many of my more libertarian brethren i am unafraid of christianity playing a role in my political thinking. i absolutely oppose the imposition of any religion by virtue of government action, but i also look for christian principles in my politicians. i think ted cruz is absolutely correct when he says that we need to get the 54 million evangelicals that didn’t show up to vote in 2012 to the polls in 2016. i absolutely believe that when deciding on a candidate for the most paramount position of power within our executive branch, that it is perfectly reasonable for christians to desire a president who prays, who seeks christ, and who loves god. furthermore, i think we would all be doing ourselves a great disservice if we ignored the fact that

Article 3 - is ted cruz a phony?
is ted cruz a phony? (before it's news) for more great articles like this visit http://www.fixthisnation.com texas senator ted cruz is under fire for a stingy record of charitable donations that some think reflects poorly on his christian values. according to cruz’s tax returns, he gave less than 1% of his income to charity between 2006 and 2010. this has inspired a new ad from a political group called americans united for values, now running on radio stations throughout iowa. the ad says that for all of cruz’s fiery religious rhetoric, he’s nothing more than a “phony”. “he doesn’t tithe?” a woman asks in the ad. “isn’t he a millionaire? his wife worked for a big wall street bank, right?” tax records show that cruz made between $$347,000 and $$2 million a year in the time frame under scrutiny. if those records tell the whole story, cruz only gave $$44,000 to charity during that time. that number seems particularly paltry given the christian ideal of tithing, which encourages the faithful to give 10% of their earnings to charity. former arkansas governor mike huckabee took advantage of the revelation to question cruz’s commitment to his faith. “i just think it’s hard to say god is first in your life if he’s last in your budget,” huckabee said in an interview with buzzfeed. “if i can’t trust god

lynchburg, va. – republican senator ted cruz announced his bid for the white house today in a speech delivered during a student convocation at liberty university, the largest christian university in the world, located in lynchburg, virginia. senator cruz spoke before a packed auditorium, saying he wants to “reignite the promise of america.” following the first of many standing ovations, mr. cruz, who is a vocal opponent of obama’s immigration policies, told the evangelical audience that if he is elected president he will “rebuild american immigration policy from the ground up.” to start, the senator said he will immediately halt obama’s proposed plan to grant amnesty to the roughly 20 million undocumented aliens currently residing in the united states. back in 2012 senator cruz said he would support deploying american troops along the u.s.-mexican border, but today he laid out a new plan for border security, one that he says will “significantly reduce the cost to american taxpayers.” the first phase of the senator’s immigration strategy, following the liquidation of the amnesty program, is to mine the 1,989 mile long border between the u.s. and mexico. “we’ve got over eleven million land mines sitting in storage, paid for by taxpayers like yourselves,” cruz told the audience, adding, “it’s time we put them to use.” in 1997 the united states signed the convention on the prohibition and use, stockpiling, production, and

Article 2 - jeb bush, 20 years after conversion, is guided by his catholic faith
“as a public leader, one’s faith should guide you,” mr. bush said in italy in 2009, explaining his attitude about the relationship between religion and politics at a conference associated with communion and liberation, a conservative catholic lay movement. “in the united states, many people think you need to keep your faith, put it in a security box, if you’re an elected official — put it in a safety deposit box until you finish your service as a public servant and then you can go get it back,” he added. “i never felt that was appropriate.” like his brother george w. bush, who established the white house office on faith-based initiatives, jeb bush was a champion of religion-based social services. as governor, he established what he said was the nation’s first faith-based prison, encouraging religious activity — of any faith tradition — in an effort to reduce criminal behavior. and he has said his religious beliefs helped inform his concern about child welfare and other issues. “you hear people say, ‘i don’t want to impose my faith,’ ” mr. bush told the newspaper the florida catholic days after leaving office in 2007. “well, it’s not an imposition of faith. it’s who you are.” the son and brother of protestant presidents, mr. bush, if elected, would be the nation’s second catholic president. sometimes, he carries a rosary in his pocket and fingers its beads at moments of crisis. he is a member

Article 4 - in florida, a look at the evangelical latino vote
miami, fla — in the competitive state of florida, all eyes are on different voter groups — including latino evangelicals. for many in this group, whether to support a democrat or republican candidate for president is not as straightforward because they support a wide range of issues, and some are more associated with republicans and some with democrats. a latino evangelical may be against abortion and same-sex marriage but support immigration and criminal justice reform. miami voter jessica garcía said she will vote for hillary clinton because she doesn't agree with donald trump's stance on immigration. in kendall, an evangelical church leader who did not want to give his name out publicly said he supports donald trump because he is opposed to obamacare; he said he has a family member who pays steep prices for health insurance even though he does not make a lot. gabriel salguero, founder and president of the national latino evangelical coalition and pastor at iglesia el calvario in orlando, said the fact that evangelical latinos ""have a broader agenda"" makes them the quintessential swing voter. according to a 2013 survey by pew research center, about 22 percent of latinos are protestant; 16 percent of them describe themselves as born-again evangelical. this is a group that practices high levels of religious commitment. among hispanic registered voters surveyed by pew in october, 47 percent said they favored clinton and 34 percent said they favored trump.

The article also mentions specific examples like ""Dual Survival"" and ""Game2: Winter,"" which are mentioned in the reliable summary. In contrast, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains inaccuracies, such as the claim about Dave Canterbury being replaced by Joseph Teti on ""Dual Survival"" (the actual reason for his departure is due to a contract dispute), and the mention of UFO sightings and alleged alien encounters, which are not relevant to the article's discussion of reality TV. Overall, the reliable summary provides a more accurate representation of the article's content.","Reality TV shows have been criticized for their ethics, contestant exploitation, and manufactured drama. Many shows use scripts to create conflict and manipulate participants into behaving in a certain way. The industry has also been accused of perpetuating negative social issues such as racism, homophobia, and sexism.

In the world of survival reality TV, hosts like Dave Canterbury have faced controversy over their portrayal on shows like ""Dual Survival."" Canterbury was replaced by Joseph Teti in Season 3, sparking debate among fans.

Meanwhile, UFO sightings and alleged alien encounters continue to fascinate the public. Shows like ""Coast to Coast AM"" have explored these topics, often featuring interviews with experts and witnesses.

A new reality TV show called ""Game2: Winter"" is set to air in Russia, where contestants will be dropped off in the Siberian wilderness with minimal equipment. The show's producers claim that ""everything is allowed,"" including rape and murder, but participants are warned that they will be subject to Russian law enforcement.

Casting calls have been issued for a new survival reality TV show, seeking outdoor adventurers to join an expedition. The show aims to highlight the challenges faced by military families and veterans as they transition back into civilian life.

In contrast, some TV shows have been criticized for their lack of quality control and excessive production values. Shows like ""American Gladiators"" and ""The Eliminator"" have been accused of being overproduced and lacking substance.

A special TV program will air on ABC to celebrate veterans and military families, featuring a home renovation show that has helped thousands of families in need. The show's executive producer notes that the program aims to honor all veterans with this television special.

Overall, these articles highlight various aspects of reality TV shows, from their ethics and production values to their portrayal of social issues and their impact on contestants and viewers.","Reality TV shows often employ a ""loser edit"" to create a narrative arc, where an obscure character is eliminated and their story is woven into the show's storyline. This concept has been used in various reality TV shows, including ""Survivor"" and ""The Amazing Race."" The term has also been applied to real-world failures, allowing viewers to identify with the characters' struggles.

TV revivals continue, with shows like ""Gilmore Girls"" returning for a four-episode miniseries on Netflix. The show follows the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore in the small town of Stars Hollow. A new Australian version of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" has premiered, featuring improvisational sketch comedy.

The concept of reality TV can be applied to real-world influence campaigns, such as Russia's digital influence campaign. Reality shows like ""The Bachelor"" manufacture drama through subtle prodding by producers and contestants' interactions. This approach is also seen in the production of alternative comedies, which often rely on reality, stand-up, and sketch elements.

Article 1 - problems with reality tv
problems with reality tv (before it's news) some of the problems with reality tv range from ethics to the actual people on the show. when reality tv first hit the big time with mtv’s real world, things were calm since no one knew what to expect. now with the deluge of reality tv shows on television right now, it was only a matter of time before bad writing, contestant exploitation, and blatant rip-offs were to inhabit the industry, and there are a lot of shows falling into the abovementioned categories. scripts are used in reality shows. it’s just a matter-of-fact now. situations are manufactured and specific lines are given to the reality show participants so that drama can unfold. most reality tv shows have specific themes and challenges that are meant to pit the contestants or participants together so they fight, argue, and cause mayhem. many people watch reality tv to satisfy the desire to laugh at those people who have problems. viewers mock, criticize, ridicule, and judge those who can’t get along with others, like to make fools of themselves, and do stupid things just to make a buck. one major problem with reality tv is the perpetuation of problems with america. the themes are enhanced when watching reality tv. racisim, homophobia, gender hatred, etc. are all obvious with some reality tv shows and subtle in others. the fact that the producers let this happen reinforces the bad elements of people which were once hidden from public view. give us anything

Article 2 - dave canterbury, former host of dual survival apologizes to fans
dave canterbury, former host of dual survival apologizes to fans (before it's news) if you have been following dual survival, you no doubt noticed that in the new season, season three, one of the hosts, dave canterbuty, was replaced by joseph teti. in case you have a life, and have not been following the developing drama over the last few years, here is a brief summary: dave canterbury, for those who remember him from the “early years”, started out as just another guy posting videos about his time in the woods on youtube. at that time was not an expert on anything, he was just another person posting about his gear and ideas on camping (what has come to be known as bushcraft these days). he was a prolific poster, and his videos were, and still are very interesting. at one point, the discovery channel decided that they wanted to make a wilderness survival show where they put together a no nonsense military vet (there is a presumption that military personnel have wilderness survival skills) and a tree hugging hippie, and watch the fun ensue. dave canterbury applied for the show, and got the job, giving him a two year contract on dual survival. almost immediately after that happened, many people who deem themselves bushcrafters got upset, after all, they also make youtube videos, why was he picked for television and not them. people with a lot of free time started digging

tv roulette: claymore, e1 (before it's news) as some of you may know, i’m currently running a patreon to support my blogging here, and one of the reward levels involves me introducing a tv roulette feature here. here’s how it works for those who backed me at that tier: once a month, you get to pick the show, and i’ll either watch the first episode (if i haven’t seen it before) or an episode of your choosing (if i have) and write about it in my best flamboyant, ranty, squee-filled style. reality tv by negotiation only, because it erodes my soul; otherwise, anything goes. if i like the show, i’ll keep it up for the next month; if i don’t, you can pick something else next time around. right now, i’ve got two tv roulette backers – the first of whom, margie, picked claymore for me to watch. so: let the inaugural tv roulette blog begin! claymore: episode 1 first impressions: this is probably not a show i should be watching with a toddler peering excitedly over my shoulder. and yet. also, why the swordmaster wearing sensible heels? practical combat footwear is practical. no, but seriously: god, i love anime (except when i don’t, but that’s another story). it’s a medium that has exactly zero fucks to give about explaining shit in the first episode, you know?

Article 7 - tv shows that need to go
with the wga strike over, tv can now return to its former glory! (no it won’t – expect most programs to either stay off the air indefinitely or return in a truncated form around april.) keep on trucking, keep on sucking: pointless, mind-numbing reality shows are still the only sure thing on television today, barring the billions of big-production game shows that have contestants involved in amazing feats of strength and brain power, from being smarter than a 5th grader to lying about really loving your wife – all in the name of entertainment! sigh… ok, seriously – we really need to pull the plug on most of this garbage. does quality control even exist anymore, or did everybody just stop caring? our standards are shot, people! the following shows are not just terrible – they’re f*cking greek tragedies. american gladiators now look, i have fond memories of titan, malibu, boner xiv, foosball and maxwell house just like any human born with a personality, but let’s not pussyfoot around the fact that this “revision” of an 80’s cult favorite is nothing more than an overproduced turd. sure, the eliminator is technically better this time around, but who cares when one-thousand wonky cameras are on every f*cking angle, making me nauseous, while the armageddon-inspired soundtrack is supposed to “move me” or something. i could give a flying medicine

Article 1 - the ‘loser edit’ that awaits us all
photo if you have ever watched a reality tv show and said, “he’s going home tonight,” you know what the “loser edit” is. i imagine it started as a matter of practicality. if you have 20 contestants, they can’t all receive equal airtime. when an obscure character gets the heave-ho, the producers have to cobble together a coherent story line. intersperse the snippets across the hour, and we can identify sins and recognizable human frailty that need to be punished. anyone tuning in for the first time catches up quickly. the loser edit is not just the narrative arc of a contestant about to be chopped, or voted off the island, whatever the catchphrase. it is the plausible argument of failure. the concept first bubbled up out of the pop-cultural ether when competitive reality shows hit upon their formula, in the form of “survivor” and “the amazing race.” tv enthusiasts — part fan, part roland barthes with a tivo — congregated on online message boards like television without pity, creating a new slang with which to dis and deconstruct their favorites. fifteen years later, the critical language used to carve up the phonies, saints and sad-sack wannabes of reality shows has migrated, and the loser edit has become a limber metaphor for exploring our own real-world failures. fate doles out ideas for subplots — fire her, dump him, all species of mortification — and we eagerly run

Article 3 - tv nostalgia fans to convene
maybe it's the battered economy that is driving the public's longing for a different era. or maybe it's hollywood's own obsession with the 1950s and '60s, as witnessed by the lineup of fall television offerings like ''pan am'' and ''the playboy club'' that are following on the success of ''mad men.'' whatever the cause, fans of old-time television, film, radio and pop culture can't get enough of the period. so from thursday through saturday they will visit hunt valley, md., for the mid-atlantic nostalgia convention to relive their memories of shows and movies like ''peyton place'' and ''the miracle worker.'' the convention, which is in its sixth year, has grown steadily in attendance, from fewer than 1,000 in 2006 to almost 5,000 last year. martin grams, who organizes the show with his wife, michelle, is projecting a crowd of 7,000 to 9,000 this year. mr. grams said there would be guest appearances bypatty duke, tony dow (wally cleaver in ''leave it to beaver'') and davy jones from ''the monkees.'' ''i always thought 'leave it to beaver' was one of the nicest shows on the air,'' said mr. grams, 34, who is an author of books on the history of old television shows, including ''the green hornet''

Article 4 - australian whose line is it anyway? suffers from dated jokes and too much ocker
o n sunday night australia premiered its very own version of whose line is it anyway? – perhaps in response to the blood debt incurred by the us with its vicious murder of our own comedy export, thank god you’re here. let’s call it even. too many have suffered. the us can’t claim complete ownership of the improvisational sketch show, though; they merely liberated it from their one-time oppressors: the english. all iterations bearing the wliia acronym follow the same template: a host submits four fast-thinking improvisers to a series of games in which the guests are expected to joke, sing, rap, impersonate and, most importantly, mug in pursuit of laughs – and nothing else. it’s “the show where everything is made up and the points don’t matter” and it can be liberating to watch comedians work tirelessly to simply fire up viewers’ pleasure centres with short bursts of primal, instinctive comedy. whose line is it anyway? what to expect from the australian iteration read more when they can pull it off, that is. the uk version – itself a spin-off from a radio show – debuted in 1988, and its first season starred stephen fry, peter cook and the fried sparrow himself, jonathan pryce. esteemed pedigree aside, the players took part in the same goofy theatresports as their aussie counterparts do today: film dub, where the actors are at the whim of those doing the speaking off stage; party quir

Article 5 - being careful out there? hardly
the genesis after 12 years of toiling at universal television, where he worked on shows like “mcmillan & wife,” mr. bochco wanted out from the grind and the internal politics. a friend urged him to go to mtm enterprises, a powerhouse in half-hour comedies that wanted to expand into hourlong dramas. at mtm, its co-founder grant tinker told him to create shows he wanted to do. photo steven bochco (co-creator and executive producer) we didn’t know what we were doing. i mean, we certainly never set out to make a show that was going to be groundbreaking in any way. mike kozoll and i basically set out just to do something that we hadn’t done before, because we were kind of bored with the genre. in fact, when fred silverman [then the chief executive of nbc] asked us to do a pilot, we pitched him other things, and he said, “no. i want a cop show.” warren littlefield (nbc executive at the time) i was the new kid on the comedy development team, and “hill street” was developed out of the comedy department. fred basically said in a development meeting, “hey, why don’t we do a one-hour ‘barney miller’?” bochco he had just seen “fort apache, the bronx,” and he said, “i’m attracted to that, because that’s a show about

Article 6 - what reality tv teaches us about russia’s influence campaign
over the past few days, i reached out to several reality show producers, asking them to compare the russian digital influence campaign and the world of unscripted tv. the more they told me about reality shows, the more the metaphor seemed to explain russia’s trolling campaign — how it worked, what it aimed to do and why campaigns like it will be so difficult to fight. the only thing that matters is drama. one of the more surprising findings about the russian influence campaign is its political incoherence. the documents released so far suggest that, as in the houston protest, the trolls didn’t seem to care very much about pushing one political side over another. they were happy to push all sides — to get people to argue for and against the islamic library — which suggests their ultimate goal was to sow drama. why? reality tv offers a guide: because drama is easy to produce, and because drama sells. on a show where the action stems from the interplay of people living in close quarters — like “the bachelor” — there are often producers on set who subtly, and sometimes less than subtly, prod the contestants into acting in certain ways. how often this happens, and to what degree, varies greatly from show to show and is matter of great secrecy and controversy within the industry. but pretty much everyone in the world of reality tv acknowledges that it happens to some degree on most shows, and that there are certain basic ways to manufacture drama. sarah gertrude shapiro

Article 8 - tv's languishing laughometer
jeez, would it kill us to laugh more? have we, the audience for television comedy, become an inveterately tough crowd, perpetually annoyed grumps who take one skeptical look at focus-grouped new sitcoms that employ empirically adorable comedians and award-winning writers from ''letterman'' and ''the simpsons,'' and still won't for the world crack one paltry half-smile? let's hope not. and even if the sitcom is dead (and when will we know?), comedy on television doesn't have to die with it. or such is the strident hypothesis of not just comedy geeks who long for lenny bruce or ''your show of shows,'' but of troublemaking channels like mtv and comedy central: that audiences can still be induced to laugh, as they have been since the beginning of time, even if nowadays it takes more than afghan-strewn couches and precocious children and laugh tracks to do it. hmm. as can-do and reasonable as the hypothesis sounds (and as clearly as ''chappelle's show''-- how we miss you -- proves it can be done), i'm not sure it's right. alternative comedies -- a manic, almost desperate medley of reality, stand-up and sketch -- have had fast-and-furious premieres this summer. they're curious, they're inventive and they're not boring, but try as they might, they just don't yield simple, genuine laughs. hoping to have

Title: losing touch with reality
Content: ''the littlest groom,'' fox's new show in which the audience is invited to gawk as a 4-foot-5 man searches for a bride, may mark an exploitative new low in television programming. it may also be the tip-off that reality television has ''jumped the shark,'' tv-aficionado lingo for the point at which programming makes a final leap into witlessness and heads irredeemably into reruns. it is hard to become too nostalgic for the golden days of reality tv, since the genre has always been a slightly sour cocktail of exploitation, voyeurism and humiliation. but looking back, it now seems as if there was a kind of innocence to the first ''survivor'' group to do darwinian battle on a deserted south china sea island, or the first ''fear factor'' contestants to munch live bugs on national television. reality television, however, demands novelty. so the networks, eyes fixed firmly on the nielsen ratings, became eager carny barkers, beckoning audiences to increasingly lurid variations on the theme. the deserted island became ''temptation island,'' where attractive singles tried to break up ''committed couples.'' on ''fear factor,'' bug eating gave way, in a recent episode, to men diving into dumpsters and pulling out pig uteruses and cow stomachs for their girlfriends to eat. american networks are not alone in this race to the bottom. last year, british television broadcast ''celebrity detox camp,'' which featured famous people getting enemas. ''jumping the shark,'' as the web site www.jumptheshark.com explains, refers to a ''happy days'' episode in which fonzie was on water skis and tried to jump over a shark, a stunt widely viewed as the beginning of the end for the series. reality tv is still well represented in the nielsens, but given its current state, it's hard to imagine that will last for long. of course, just as reality television succeeded the craze inspired by ''who wants to be a millionaire,'' there is undoubtedly a new genre waiting in the wings. we're sure whatever it is will make for compelling viewing.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Reality TV shows have been criticized for their ethics, contestant exploitation, and manufactured drama. Many shows use scripts to create conflict and manipulate participants into behaving in a certain way. The industry has also been accused of perpetuating negative social issues such as racism, homophobia, and sexism.

In the world of survival reality TV, hosts like Dave Canterbury have faced controversy over their portrayal on shows like ""Dual Survival."" Canterbury was replaced by Joseph Teti in Season 3, sparking debate among fans.

Meanwhile, UFO sightings and alleged alien encounters continue to fascinate the public. Shows like ""Coast to Coast AM"" have explored these topics, often featuring interviews with experts and witnesses.

A new reality TV show called ""Game2: Winter"" is set to air in Russia, where contestants will be dropped off in the Siberian wilderness with minimal equipment. The show's producers claim that ""everything is allowed,"" including rape and murder, but participants are warned that they will be subject to Russian law enforcement.

Casting calls have been issued for a new survival reality TV show, seeking outdoor adventurers to join an expedition. The show aims to highlight the challenges faced by military families and veterans as they transition back into civilian life.

In contrast, some TV shows have been criticized for their lack of quality control and excessive production values. Shows like ""American Gladiators"" and ""The Eliminator"" have been accused of being overproduced and lacking substance.

A special TV program will air on ABC to celebrate veterans and

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Reality TV shows often employ a ""loser edit"" to create a narrative arc, where an obscure character is eliminated and their story is woven into the show's storyline. This concept has been used in various reality TV shows, including ""Survivor"" and ""The Amazing Race."" The term has also been applied to real-world failures, allowing viewers to identify with the characters' struggles.

TV revivals continue, with shows like ""Gilmore Girls"" returning for a four-episode miniseries on Netflix. The show follows the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore in the small town of Stars Hollow. A new Australian version of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" has premiered, featuring improvisational sketch comedy.

The concept of reality TV can be applied to real-world influence campaigns, such as Russia's digital influence campaign. Reality shows like ""The Bachelor"" manufacture drama through subtle prodding by producers and contestants' interactions. This approach is also seen in the production of alternative comedies, which often rely on reality, stand-up, and sketch elements.

In recent years, TV nostalgia has become a popular trend, with fans gathering for conventions to relive memories of classic shows and movies. The Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention has grown steadily in attendance, featuring guest appearances by celebrities from old-time television and film.

New streaming services have emerged, offering a wide range of shows and movies. ""Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life"" is a four-episode minis

6413923.0,fake,reliable,0.9,118.0407691001892,False,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, as it accurately reports on a recent development in Greece's economic crisis, specifically an investigation into former Prime Minister George Papandreou and his government for alleged manipulation of the country's deficit in 2009. The summary also mentions other relevant news items, such as the European Union's approval of a sixth installment of bailout aid for Greece and concerns about the stability of Cypriot banks and government finances.  The only discrepancy between the article and the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY is that the article does not mention the Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson's resignation or the plane crash in Nepal. However, these are unrelated news items and do not affect the accuracy of the summary regarding Greece's economic crisis.  Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of Greece's economy and politics, making it the most accurate representation of the article.","Greek economic prosecutors are seeking felony charges against the former president of the Greek Statistics Authority, Andreas Georgiou, over alleged manipulation of the country's deficit in 2009. The investigation also targets the head of the Directorate for National Accounts and the Head of Special Department of Statistics Research.

In Greece, a recent vote led to the resignation of Prime Minister George Papandreou, who had threatened to say ""a whole paragraph"" if his demands were not met. New Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has since taken office, threatening ""disorderly default"" if his demands are not met.

Meanwhile, in other news, Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson resigned after falsely claiming a degree in computer science on his resume. A plane crashed in Nepal, killing 15 people and injuring six others. JPMorgan Chase's Chief Investment Officer is reportedly stepping down following the financial giant's $2-billion trading loss.

Greek politician Alexis Tsipras wrote an open letter to the German people, criticizing the European Union's handling of Greece's economic crisis. The European Central Bank (ECB) has signaled its readiness to buy up massive quantities of Italian and Spanish debt in an effort to stabilize the eurozone.

In related news, the Greek government is implementing an emergency property tax, which will be collected by the Public Power Company (DEH). The Finance Minister has sent a letter to DEH, instructing them to continue collecting the tax despite a recent court ruling that deemed it illegal.","Greece is facing significant economic challenges, including a high debt-to-GDP ratio and a struggling economy. The country's caretaker prime minister has appointed a temporary cabinet to manage the country's affairs until June 17. A rating agency, Fitch, has downgraded Greece's debt from B- to CCC, citing the heightened risk that Greece may not be able to sustain its membership in the economic and monetary union.

The Greek government is under pressure to raise €13.5 billion through tax increases and spending cuts. An investigation into the bank accounts of over 30 Greek politicians has been opened to determine whether they should be charged with tax evasion. The country's two main labor unions have called for a general strike, which was held on Thursday, resulting in disruptions to public transportation and services.

Greece's proximity to Cyprus has led to concerns about the stability of Cypriot banks and government finances. Cyprus Popular amassed €3.4 billion in Greek bonds, while Bank of Cyprus accumulated €2.4 billion worth. The Greek debt crisis exposed the perils of extending loans to Greek businesses and consumers.

The European Union has approved a sixth installment of bailout aid for Greece, but the country's prime minister is struggling to persuade his party members that Greece must agree to another round of austerity measures. A plan to transfer much of Greece's debt to the rest of Europe may be a passing fancy.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has shifted its stance on Greece's debt, advocating for a break on its debt burden. The IMF's conclusion is that Greece can no longer repay its debt and must follow through on tough economic measures.

Standard & Poor's (S&P) has downgraded Portugal and Greece again, citing concerns about the countries' ability to pay their debts. S&P warned that investors may be forced to dump short-dated Portuguese debt to protect themselves from default, making it harder for Lisbon to raise money by issuing short-dated bills.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

(before it's news) greek economic prosecutors are seeking felony charges against the former president of the greek statistics authority andreas georgiou over upwards manipulation of the greek deficit in 2009 and thus with the aim to push the country into the imf bailout mechanism. apart from georgiou felony charges are also to be raised against the head of directorate for national accounts, and the head of special department of statistics research. the three are facing felony charges on the ground that they “artificially” revised the debt from 12% to 15.4% in 2009, so that stricter measures of fiscal adjustments should be imposed. georgiou and co. are to face also misdemeanor offenses for ‘repeatdely dereliction of duty’ and ‘making false statements’. at the same time, the prosecutors seek to identify the instigators of the deficit ‘cooking’ as well as the possible involvement of other people. because of the importance of the case, the case is to be investigated by the judge responsible for corruption cases. the scandal of deficti revision broke in september 2011, when ex elstat board member zoi georganta, professor for econometrics at the university of macedonia, spoke to several greek media and claimed that greece’s budget deficit underwent a upward

Article 2 - greek no to austerity may lead to disclosure of secret european space program
greek no to austerity may lead to disclosure of secret european space program (before it's news) sunday’s vote in greece was a simple question about whether or not voters would accept the latest bailout package by “the troika” of major financial institutions: the international monetary fund, the european central bank and the european commission. by voting ‘no’, the greek people said that they rejected the troika’s core demand that staying within the european union’s fiscal system meant adhering to its strict limits on government spending in relation to national debt levels. maintaining these strict fiscal limits, the general public was told, enables inflation to stay low and preserves the value of the currency, which for europe is the euro. in reality, minimizing government public spending to preserve the euro’s value, enables more funds to be siphoned off by the european central bank and other national central banks into a highly classified black budget for a multinational secret space program where european nations play a prominent role. the current policy of the european central bank is the reverse of mainstream fiscal policy. in periods of recession or low economic growth, the idea is that governments spend money to stimulate the economy. governments usually do this by issuing treasury bonds that private entities, central banks or other governments buy. these government treasury bonds become a debt to be repaid at a future time. greek governments have been doing this for decades to maintain welfare policies, and overall government debt has reached an unsustainable level of nearly 180% of the gross domestic

emergency property tax: law is the …letter of greek finance minister % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! finance minister yiannis stournaras found a new way to make laws. by sending letters. monday night, he sent letter to management of public power company (deh) asking the company to continue collecting the emergency property tax. furthermore, the finance ministry will appeal to supreme court against the decision of first instance court in athens that recently ruled, it was illegal for deh to collect the property levy. with his letter to deh,, stournaras enforces the greek ppc to issue electricity bills including the property levy, even before the country’s judiciary power takes a final decision on the issue. practically, stournaras’ letter means that consumers will continue to pay the emergency property tax via deh bills and risk to have electricity being cut as the levy skyrockets the bills especially for households suffering from wages and pensions cuts and unemployment. not to mention that deh plans 25% hikes for 2013. last winter the supreme court had ruled that it was not against the constitution to collect the emergency property tax, however under the condition that it was only for two years. moreover, the sc had ruled that it was against the constitution to cut electricity to those who hadn’t paid the property levy. ppc sources told greek media, that the decision of

Article 5 - the art of extortion: now at the imf
(before it's news) zerohedge ~ wolf richter www.testosteronepit.com treasury secretary “hank” paulson was the trailblazer with his proposal for tarp in september 2008. he walked into the capitol with a list of demands—unlimited powers to hand unlimited amounts of taxpayer money to whomever—and threatened that the whole world would collapse if his demands weren’t met immediately. when congress didn’t go for it, markets fell off a cliff, and paulson’s world of finance appeared to come to an end. so congress approved a more limited tarp, which ended up being irrelevant compared to the trillions the fed would hand out. thus, paulson’s extortion had worked—though the source of money had shifted from the treasury to the fed. it would be copied. in november, just after the g-20 meeting in cannes, france, it was greek prime minister giorgios papandreou’s turn. with a single sentence about a referendum on greece’s exit from the eurozone, he knocked the world’s financial markets into a tailspin. his message: give me more money and larger write-downs on greek debt, or else i will say a whole paragraph. it reopened the spigot, and money started flowing again (temporarily). in early january, it was greece’s new prime minister lucas papademos. he threatened the world with “disorderly default.” his goal:

Article 1 - temporary cabinet named in greece as agency lowers nation&#8217;s debt rating
photo athens — political and economic tremors rolled out of greece and across europe again on thursday as the caretaker prime minister, panagiotis pikrammenos, appointed a temporary cabinet to manage the country’s affairs until june 17, when the second general election in a little more than a month is held. an increasingly urgent question is whether europe can afford to wait until that election, which is expected to determine the future of the troubled country in the euro zone and the broader stability of the bloc. events may force european officials’ hand much earlier. on thursday, the rating agency fitch lowered its rating on greek debt from b- to a lowly ccc, saying in a statement that the downgrade “reflects the heightened risk that greece may not be able to sustain its membership of economic and monetary union” after the strong showing of anti-austerity parties in the may 6 elections. indeed, the leader of one of those parties, the coalition of the radical left, or syriza, which placed second in the elections and is now leading in opinion polls, repeated his opposition to the bailout deal, known as the memorandum, in an interview with state television on wednesday night. advertisement continue reading the main story “there is no memorandum,” the syriza leader, alexis tsipras, 37, told the state channel net. “the memorandum is finished politically because it has not produced results,” he said, referring to a

Article 2 - greece seeks taxes from wealthy with cash havens in london
at the request of the athens government, the british financial authorities recently handed over a detailed list of about 400 greek individuals who have bought and sold london properties since 2009. the list, closely guarded, has not been publicly disclosed. but greek officials are examining it to determine whether the people named — who they say include prominent businessmen, bankers, shipping tycoons and professional athletes — have deceived the tax authorities by understating their wealth. “these people have money and they are known — but it is not clear yet if they have violated any laws,” said haris theoharis, an official in the greek finance ministry. tax investigators have been examining the list to see whether there is any overlap between those who bought london properties and those already identified as being tax cheats. the greek government, under pressure from its international lenders to raise 13.5 billion euros ($17.4 billion) through tax increases and spending cuts, is intent on making the well-heeled share the burden. studies have shown that the country may be forgoing as much as 30 billion euros a year in uncollected taxes, with a significant portion of that amount having been shipped out of the country as the affluent seek shelter from greece’s financial storm. this week, the government of prime minister antonis samaras opened an investigation into the bank accounts of more than 30 greek politicians to determine whether they should be charged with tax evasion and the illegal accumulation of wealth. the

Article 3 - bomb attacks in greece raise fear of radicalism
they point to a police raid on dec. 20 on the villa amalia, a gathering point in central athens that has been home to antiauthoritarian youth and some anarchists for two decades. while the greek authorities called the villa an “anarchist stronghold,” its occupants described it as a cultural center offering free concerts, an occasional children’s nursery and a space for publishing antiauthoritarian literature. the police evicted the squatters, arrested eight people and confiscated gas masks, propane gas and hundreds of empty beer bottles that they said could be used to make explosives and firebombs. they conducted a second raid on jan. 9, arresting 92 squatters who had moved back in and padlocked the building. within days of the second raid, violence flared. attacks were carried out on greek government offices, banks, businesses and other establishment symbols, including the simultaneous explosions at mr. konstas’s building and the homes of the other journalists. the home of the government spokesman’s brother was firebombed. on monday, unidentified gunmen strafed mr. samaras’s party headquarters with an ak-47. the bomb that was ignited sunday went off at 11 a.m. inside a shopping center run by a company belonging to one of greece’s wealthiest men, spiros latsis. about 200 people were inside when news organizations received calls warning that a bomb would explode in half an hour. the police evacuated the building and said

Article 4 - greek workers walk out in protest for 7th time
athens — thousands of greek workers walked off the job on thursday in the seventh general strike this year to protest government austerity policies after a year and a half of cutbacks. the strike came two days after greece’s new three-party coalition government secured european union approval for a crucial sixth installment of bailout aid, without which the country would have faced default. euro zone finance ministers decided to release $7.7 billion that their countries are contributing to the $10.6 billion installment. the international monetary fund is due in the coming days to decide on the disbursement of the remaining amount. the latest strike was less disruptive than previous walkouts, with the police putting the crowd numbers in athens at about 17,000, compared with 50,000 in a walkout in october, with little violence. the only moment of tension occurred when a few dozen youths clashed with riot police officers in the central athens district of exarchia. there were no reports of injuries. flights operated largely as scheduled and public transportation ran a limited service to enable workers to attend protest rallies. national rail service, however, was halted, and ferries were moored in their ports. tax offices, courts and schools closed, hospitals were operating with only emergency staff and customs officials walked off the job. the action was called by the country’s two main labor unions, which represent about 2.5 million workers. they are demanding that austerity measures which were voted through parliament under the previous socialist

Article 5 - greek crisis leaves cyprus mired in debt
but a collapse of cyprus popular would also be more bad news for the rest of the euro zone, just as a new fog of financial gloom seems to be descending on europe. the shaky state of cypriot banks and government finances threatens to add another name to the list of euro countries needing international bailouts. “that is why it behooves us as cypriots and europeans not to let it happen,” mr. sarris said last week, shortly before flying to moscow to meet with russian bankers and wealthy individuals about investing in his bank. all told, cypriot banks have outstanding loans or other money at risk totaling €152 billion, or eight times the size of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the international monetary fund. it is the same kind of extreme vulnerability to financial shocks that devastated ireland. greece, because of its proximity to cyprus and a common language, had seemed a logical place for cypriot banks to expand by extending loans to greek businesses and consumers and loading up on greek government debt. cyprus popular amassed €3.4 billion in greek bonds, according to data from the european banking authority. bank of cyprus, the island’s largest commercial bank, accumulated €2.4 billion worth. in both cases, the banks’ holdings of greek bonds were larger than their holdings of all other government bonds combined. the greek debt crisis exposed the perils of that strategy. cyprus popular lost

Article 6 - too radical a debt plan from greece
“it was a nice idea, but not defensible in current circumstances,” said daniel gros, the head of the center for european policy studies in brussels, who took part in one of the meetings with the prime minister to discuss the plan’s merits. “if there is one person who cannot propose something like this, it is the greek prime minister. it would have to be a german.” this week, mr. papandreou is struggling to persuade his increasingly disruptive party members that greece must agree to another round of austerity measures to qualify for a second portion of loans from the european union and the international monetary fund. those measures include closing down public-sector enterprises, selling more assets and increasing tax revenue. the new package will be submitted to greece’s parliament on thursday and a vote is expected before the end of the month. signs are growing, however, that the patience of the long-suffering greek public is wearing thin. mr. papandreou’s approval ratings are below 30 percent and, as uncertainty builds, greeks continue to take money out of the banking system. mr. papandreou’s interest in a plan to transfer much of the country’s debt to the rest of europe may well have been a passing fancy. and mr. papandreou’s chance of persuading jean-claude trichet, the president of europe’s central bank, to take on even more debt on top of the nearly 200 billion euros ($292 billion

Article 7 - the greek debt deal’s missing piece
the greek debt drama has had its share of twists and turns. alliances have shifted, rivalries have deepened, and the back-room maneuverings have been appropriately byzantine. but the i.m.f. shift from being greece’s most persistent scold to its main advocate for a break on its debt has been among the most intriguing developments so far. clashing assessments in late june, representatives of european countries and the i.m.f. gathered at a private meeting at the european union’s headquarters in brussels. the officials were racing against time to devise a plan to keep the country in the eurozone. but the dispute between greece’s two largest lenders was about to boil over. poul m. thomsen, the danish fund official who served as the i.m.f. point person in the greek talks, had been negotiating around the clock, and his voice was hoarse. since early in the spring, he had been arguing that while greece needed to follow through on tough economic measures, its debt was out of control. europe, however, insisted that the greek government had only to enact tough austerity measures to set itself on a prudent financial path. now the europeans wanted to highlight their own, more sanguine view of greece’s debt prospects at a crucial meeting of the creditor countries’ finance ministers the next day. and in doing so they took the i.m.f.’s conclusion — that greece could no longer repay its debt and

Article 8 - s.&p. downgrades portugal and greece again
mr. mcguire said that investors had been dumping short-dated portuguese debt this week to protect themselves from default, making it harder for lisbon to raise money by issuing short-dated bills and hence make it to june without a bailout. if fitch and moody’s investors service both downgrade portugal by one more notch, it will cost investors 5 percent more to use its debt as collateral in exchange for loans from the european central bank. meanwhile, investors are waiting for the results of a health check on irish banks, scheduled for release by the irish central bank on thursday, and an announcement from the european central bank about a new facility to support struggling banks that will be focused initially on irish lenders. in june, the results of stress tests on european banks, and steps to recapitalize them, will be announced. photo mr. mcguire said that countries like ireland, greece and portugal would either have to default or “pray that a surge in economic growth comes along to save them.” the euro was broadly steady, at $1.4088, from levels late monday. s.& p. said portugal was likely to have to turn to the european stability mechanism, which is being set up by european countries, for aid. unlike greece, portugal might be able to avoid restructuring its debt, but the agency said that the government’s unsecured debt, or debt issued without the security of an underlying asset, would

Title: greek prosecutor calls papandreou, papaconstantinou on 2009-revised deficit
Content: greek prosecutor calls papandreou, papaconstantinou on 2009-revised deficit (before it's news) a bombshell with a weight of at least one mega-tone was dropped in the picturesque city of athens on friday afternoon. thus while greek government officials have been dealing with the troika on the left and the private greek bond holders on the right. economic prosecutor grigoris peponis requested in a letter to prosecutor of supreme court that former prime minister george papandreou, former finance minister george papaconstantinou and other members of the economic team of the previous government would be checked on ‘any possible criminal liabilities” concerning the budget deficit of 2009 that was upwards revised by the greek statistics authority (elstat). peponis requested that the file would be submitted to the greek parliament. ﻿﻿﻿the economic prosecutor mentions the names of 18 people who have testified on the case and underlines that ”in the majority of testimonies, it has been explicitly referred to artificial swelling and arbitrary determination of the public deficit in 2009 at one hand, and possible responsibilities of the then prime minister, members of the then government and the then ministers of finance.” the move caused concerns at the supreme court because the president of the elstat had not be invited to testify by the prosecutor. the move caused surprise in the coalition government partner pasok because the last think papandreou-supporters would need now is an investigation against their party leader – even if he is thinking of resigning form the party leadership. the move caused no reaction in the public opinion becasue no greek is willing to believe that any greek politician would ever testify for anything or be held responsible. for further reading on revised budget deficit 2oo9 , new scandal with elstat? read more at keep talking greece source:

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the summary, and all claims made by the article are supported by the facts mentioned in the reliable news summary. The only minor discrepancy is that the reliable news summary mentions California's zero-emission vehicle mandate driving industry effort on battery power, while the article does not explicitly state this as a reason for Toyota's shift towards mass-producing long-range EVs. However, this is a minor point and does not affect the overall classification of the article as reliable.","In 2012, Tesla Motors completed a $100 million supplier agreement with Toyota to provide electric batteries and drive trains for an all-electric version of the Rav4 compact SUV. This partnership marked a significant step forward in sustainable mobility.

The development of environmentally friendly cars has gained momentum, with hybrid vehicles becoming increasingly popular. Hybrid cars use gasoline in addition to a battery and motor to power the automobile, reducing consumption and emissions. Toyota's Prius is one of the most popular hybrids available.

Global electric vehicle (EV) sales reached 549,000 in 2016, increasing by 72.83% year-on-year. China sold 331,100 EVs, with a year-on-year surge of 343%. The future global and Chinese EV markets are expected to maintain rapid development pace.

Mitsubishi's next-generation Lancer Evolution will feature a hybrid powertrain, including a diesel-electric system. This move aims to reduce emissions and improve sustainability.

BMW is advancing automotive sustainability through its expansion into the electric vehicle business. The company is pursuing ""electro-mobility,"" a concept that goes beyond traditional electric vehicles.

Toyota has released patents on hydrogen fuel cells, aiming to jumpstart the transition to a ""hydrogen economy."" However, the production of hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars is still expensive and not yet commercially viable.

The lithium-ion battery technology has become increasingly popular in hybrid electric vehicles, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional nickel-metal hydride batteries.","Toyota is considering mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) with a range of over 300 km, contrary to its previous stance on reserving EVs for short-distance commuting. The company aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020, primarily in Japan and California.

In contrast, Toyota has previously promoted plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as alternatives to conventional cars. However, the company is now exploring electric powertrains.

Other automakers, such as Nissan and Volkswagen, have also touted pure electric cars as viable zero-emission vehicles for the future. California's zero-emission vehicle mandate has driven industry effort on battery power in recent years.

The Toyota FT-EV II concept features a solar-powered recharge system and no steering wheel or accelerator pedals, instead using hand controls to control the vehicle. The company is also developing hybrid vehicles, such as the Avalon XLE Premium I, which combines a 2.5-liter engine with two electric motor-generators.

In Japan, the government is pushing for subsidies and tax breaks to bring the cost of fuel-cell cars down to around $20,000 by 2025. The country aims to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by the end of March 2016.

Overall, Toyota's shift towards mass-producing long-range EVs marks a significant change in its strategy, as the company seeks to adapt to changing market demands and regulatory requirements.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

tesla-powered electric toyotas come to market in 2012 headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! according to news last week, upstart electric carmaker tesla motors took another major step forward when it completed a $100 million supplier agreement with toyota to provide electric batteries and drive trains for an all-electric version of the popular rav4 compact suv beginning in 2012. the agreement runs through 2014. according to the agreement, tesla will provide for the “supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software.” the joint development for the electric powertrain began just one year ago, a move that was formalized in october with a services agreement in which toyota purchased $50 million worth of tesla stock. toyota now owns a 2.9% stake in the company, which was started by paypal founder elon musk. toyota, which makes the best-selling hybrid in america, the prius, as well as five of the top-ten hybrids, is branching out into the all-electric vehicle market, in recognition of the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of sustainable mobility. their investment in an all-electric rav4 will do a great deal to bolster that segment and maintain toyota’s position at or near the cutting edge of automotive technology, even if it does cannibalize sales

environmentally friendly cars (before it's news) many of us fondly remember fred flinstone and his foot-powered automobile. unfortunately, the self-powered car never materialized in our real world. instead, we have millions of cars on the road today that all use a lot of gas and produce fumes that are harmful to our environment. environmentally friendly cars are a big step in the right direction. while many still require the use of gasoline the consumption is severely reduced, and to many people that care deeply for the environment that is wonderful news. one of the most popular types of environmentally friendly cars is the hybrid. the hybrid car uses gasoline in order to function, but it does not use gasoline to the same degree that regular cars and trucks do. instead, hybrid cars use gasoline in addition to a battery and motor to power the automobile. the battery helps to make a smaller amount of gas last longer. this means that hybrids often have a much higher mile per gallon (mpg) rating than regular cars. a lot of the top car suppliers have begun selling hybrid cars in order to help people consume less gasoline, especially as gas prices continue to grow. one of the most popular hybrids available is the toyota prius. this model offers a convenient hatchback design and its success and reliability has helped to place hybrids as a viable automobile option even to many of the most severe critics. honda also sells a popular hybrid option, that being their civic hybrid. as hybrids develop further many companies are starting

the bmw i3: advancing automotive sustainabilityhttp://members.beforeitsnews.com/contribute/ headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the following post is a part of triplepundit’s coverage of the 2011 opportunity green conference in los angeles, california. to read all the posts in the series, click here. by kara scharwath when i think about the companies that are leading in the corporate social responsibility space, i have to admit that the automobile industry doesn’t generally make it onto my short list. despite the success of the nissan leaf and the chevy volt, i still have some reservations about just how much greener electric cars really are. in my mind, the materials and energy intensive nature of automobile manufacturing seems like an impossible hurdle to overcome. however, a presentation given by bmw’s manuel sattig at opportunity green 2011 has me rethinking my assumptions. it turns out that among auto manufacturers, bmw is one of the most sustainable in the world. it was ranked as the second most sustainable global vehicle manufacturer by newsweek this year, and is the only car company that has been ranked on the dow jones sustainability index every year since the index’s inception. now bmw is using it’s expansion into the electric vehicle business as an opportunity to question and rethink their entire business. according to sattig, bmw is pursing “electro-mobility,” a concept that goes beyond

Article 6 - ces: toyota releases patents on hydrogen fuel cells
ces: toyota releases patents on hydrogen fuel cells (before it's news) mark lee rollins for redorbit.com – your universe online yesterday at the ces, toyota surprised several people by releasing their multi-thousand patent portfolio library on hydrogen fuel cells, for general industry use. this, they hope, will jumpstart the change to a “hydrogen economy”. it’s also interesting that a hydrogen-powered fuel cell car is available for purchase, at about $$57,000. one spokesperson agreed when i stated they are losing money on that car. maybe not 7 figures, but it certainly costs well over the sales figure to craft a luxury vehicle, then make it powered by hydrogen. also to reiterate: hydrogen is not found mixed amongst the morning dew. you have to use energy or some kind to break apart water into hydrogen and oxygen. said energy is either from burning petroleum fuels, or wind power, or solar, or nuclear. hydrogen is far more explosive than gasoline, as far as what minimal percent in the air can explode. it has no odor, can burn almost invisibly, and can damage tubing due to something called hydrogen embrittlement. but what is interesting here, is that toyota will honestly make it easier for other manufacturers to make it fuel-cell car. it will not be that easy because, although you can get diagrams online on what a nuclear warhead looks like, you probably aren’t going to be able to make one. there is also an advantage to

Article 7 - the electric car penny stock that you need to know about
the electric car penny stock that you need to know about % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) battery power — as you know it — is officially dead. but one electric car penny stock stands to change all that, alongside the fortunes of select few investors in 2010. the nickel-metal hydride battery, which has long been the standard in hybrid electric vehicles, is fast becoming more obsolete than the record player collecting dust in your attic. in fact, the entire battery industry was jolted into a veritable age of discovery and advancement only a few short years ago as higher gas prices vaulted once-maligned hybrid vehicles to the forefront of big auto’s to-do list. the toyota prius soon became the flagship hybrid model, prompting government tax breaks — and waiting lists at dealerships across the u.s. but there has been one big problem… the nickel-metal hydride batteries in many first-generation hybrid vehicles are adding extra weight and space to the design. according to a 2010 global business intelligence report, nickel-metal hydride batteries are used in 97% of hybrids sold today. of course, the extra bulk — and the heat generated by these traditional batteries — adversely affects the mileage of hybrid electric vehicles. the solution to the inefficient nickel-metal hydride batteries is the lithium-ion battery technology. lithium-ion’s offerings are clearly superior: they’re lighter and smaller and pack more charging power. lithium-ion

business news | mon nov 7, 2016 | 1:59am gmt toyota, in about-face, may mass-produce long-range electric cars - nikkei visitors walk past a logo of toyota motor corp on a toyota prius hybrid vehicle at the company's showroom in tokyo august 5, 2014. reuters/yuya shino/file photo tokyo toyota motor corp ( 7203.t ) is looking at mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (evs) that would hit the market around 2020, the nikkei newspaper reported on monday, in what would be a dramatic reversal in strategy for the world's top-selling automaker. even as rivals such as nissan motor co ( 7201.t ) and volkswagen ag ( vowg_p.de ) have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, toyota has said it would reserve evs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. by adding longer-range evs to its product range, toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (fcvs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. the nikkei business daily, without citing sources, said toyota would set up a team in early 2017 dedicated to developing electric cars that can travel more than 300 km (186 miles) on

Article 2 - some hybrid vehicles are here; their tax status remains vague
only after that law was passed did hybrids appear -- vehicles that run part-time on electric power, but do not have to be plugged in for recharging, as purely electric vehicles do. ''i wouldn't take tax advice from a car dealer,'' mr. mikrut added, but he did not have definitive advice of his own. a toyota spokeswoman, martha voss, said the company did not contend that the prius was eligible for the electric-vehicle credit but that it qualified for a different tax benefit, a $2,000 clean-vehicle deduction that can be claimed on form 1040. ed cohen, a spokesman for honda, which produces the insight, the only other hybrid vehicle on the market, said his company did not maintain that the insight qualified for either the clean-vehicle deduction or the electric-vehicle credit. both the insight and the prius are fueled with gasoline and use some of the power from the internal combustion engine to make electricity. but in the insight, much less gasoline is turned into electrical energy than in the prius. at the white house, a spokeswoman, claire buchan, said tonight that the bush administration's energy proposal ''clarifies and expands the current law.'' she said it did not specify the structure or the dollar amount of tax credits and that this would be worked out with congress. mr. zubritsky would like the credit but is not eager to be a test case. the tax-form instructions, he noted, say

Article 3 - this summer, electric cars are merging into california’s traffic
“the people who buy this car are the movers and shakers — leaders in arts, entertainment, business,” said paul scott, a co-founder of the advocacy group plug in america who now sells electric leafs at a nissan dealership in downtown los angeles. “i sold a leaf to danny devito,” mr. scott said. “he’s that kind of guy. but you’ve got a lot of people who just will not put themselves into a small car.” on the other hand, he said, celebrities who live large are the ones who “will drive the market” if they embrace upscale electric cars like the tesla, influencing purchases by regular janes and joes. following the model s’s introduction last weekend, tesla is providing thousands of test drives for reservation holders, starting in fremont and los angeles before moving on to a dozen cities across north america. california drivers are also getting a chance to get behind the wheel of the $38,145 electric sedan from coda, based in los angeles, at test-drive events through the summer in southern california and the san francisco bay area. the car will initially be sold through four dealerships in the state. what’s markedly different about the plug-in vehicle market this summer is the growing presence of some of the world’s largest carmakers. ford began slowly delivering its $40,000 focus electric to dealers in may (a month in which just six units were sold) and was expecting to ship

Article 4 - rethinking mobility in tokyo
do automobiles really need steering wheels? who needs an accelerator pedal -- or a brake pedal, for that matter? does a vehicle really need four wheels, or is one enough? these are the challenges to conventional thinking that exhibitors at this year's tokyo motor show are trying to address as the auto industry comes to terms with a future that promises to change all the rules. the 2009 tokyo show, which opened to the public in this suburb on oct. 24 and runs through nov. 4, is much smaller, as struggling foreign automakers decided to stay away. but the dreams of the about 10 automakers who did display vehicles (down from about 35 at the last tokyo show, two years ago) are expansive enough to shake up the entire industry. only at tokyo, which has a reputation for being a free-spirited, sometimes whimsical auto show, would you find an electric unicycle, a car that drives like a video game, robotic prosthetic aids or a prototype for a solar-powered gasoline-free gas station. the toyota ft-ev ii concept, besides being a zero-emissions electric vehicle recharged partly by solar cells, also has no steering wheel or accelerator and brake pedals. the ft-ev ii suggests that a vehicle can be controlled with joysticks alone. the driver starts, accelerates, steers and stops the vehicle by using only hand controls mounted on a bow-shaped apparatus. the dashboard is also gone

Article 5 - straying a bit beyond its own comfort zone
in contrast, the avalon xle premium i drove, which starts at $33,990, left something of a cheap taste in my mouth. (the base xle is priced at $31,785, about $2,000 less than last year’s entry model.) those versions may interest people who want to maximize interior acreage without spending a fortune and are willing to forgo features like a standard navigation system, a powerful audio system, a driver’s memory seat or rain-sensing wipers. in fact, for this type of large and unhurried sedan — and specifically a toyota — the hybrid seems the smarter play. the first-ever avalon hybrid adopts the camry hybrid’s 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine and two electric motor-generators; one is driven by the gas engine to produce electricity and charge the 245-volt battery, and the second, independent motor helps propel the car. with the 156-horsepower piston engine, this latest hybrid synergy drive system — quieter and smoother than before — produces a combined 200 horses. at 40 m.p.g. in town and 39 on the highway, the hybrid’s federal ratings swamp the 21/31 m.p.g. tally of gas-only models. in real-world testing, and despite slogs through manhattan traffic, the hybrid showed me 36 m.p.g. over all, a remarkable 50 percent gain over the 24 m.p.g. of the standard

Article 6 - japan moves to fast-track cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells
with two of japan’s three biggest automakers going all in on fuel cells, the country’s long-term future as an automotive powerhouse could now hinge largely on the success of what they hope will be an important technology in the next few decades. the auto sector carries special significance in japan, providing nearly one in 11 jobs and about one-fifth of its manufacturing output. it is also one of the few big industries where japan remains at the pinnacle of global competition, after losing much of its edge in electronics and elsewhere. japan’s governing party is pushing for ample subsidies and tax breaks for consumers to bring the cost of a fuel-cell car down to about $20,000 by 2025. the government is also aiming to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by the end of march 2016 in urban areas where the vehicles will be sold initially. “to stay globally competitive, japan cannot afford to lag behind in this area,” said yuriko koike, a former environment minister who heads a group of ruling party lawmakers advocating hydrogen energy. a fuel-cell vehicle, running on electricity from cells that combine hydrogen with oxygen, emits only water vapor and heat. hydrogen fuel production from hydrocarbons emits some carbon dioxide, although japan hopes to put carbon-free production into effect by 2040. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree

Article 7 - toyota, in about-face, may mass-produce long-range electric cars -nikkei - business insider
print tokyo, nov 7 (reuters) - toyota motor corp is looking at mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (evs) that would hit the market around 2020, the nikkei newspaper reported on monday, in what would be a dramatic reversal in strategy for the world's top-selling automaker. even as rivals such as nissan motor co and volkswagen ag have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, toyota has said it would reserve evs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. by adding longer-range evs to its product range, toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (fcvs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. the nikkei business daily, without citing sources, said toyota would set up a team in early 2017 dedicated to developing electric cars that can travel more than 300 km (186 miles) on a single charge. plans under consideration include using an existing vehicle platform such as that of the prius hybrid car or corolla for the ev, the nikkei said. the paper added that toyota aims to begin selling its first long-range ev in 2020 in japan, which will host the summer olympics that year, as well as other markets such as california where automakers are required to sell a certain portion of zero-em

Article 8 - automakers look beyond electric
in the last decade, a new wave of industry effort on battery power was driven by california's zero-emission vehicle mandate, set in motion in 1990. the z.e.v. mandate, as it is known, will require automakers to derive 10 percent of their sales from highly efficient cars, and some from vehicles with no tailpipe emissions at all. california regulators see this as an attempt to clean the state's air. many automakers view it as a threat to their businesses. california is not just the largest auto market in the united states, but because its clean air rules predate the federal clean air act, other states can follow california's tougher air regulations, as new york and massachusetts do. the z.e.v. mandate was supposed to take effect with the 2003 model year, but has been stalled by a legal challenge from general motors and daimlerchrysler. california regulators plan to rewrite the rule some time next year. still, because it takes years to develop new cars, automakers have been at work. detroit's concerns were intensified after california passed a new regulation this year that will force carmakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by the 2008 model year. the latest efforts to build battery-powered electrics have been as frustrating as previous attempts. toyota has sold a few electric rav4 sport utility vehicles in california, but at a considerable loss. ford's worldwide goal was to sell 5,000 think city subcompact cars annually,

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Toyota is considering mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) with a range of over 300 km, contrary to its previous stance on reserving EVs for short-distance commuting. The company aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020, primarily in Japan and California.

In contrast, Toyota has previously promoted plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as alternatives to conventional cars. However, the company is now exploring electric powertrains.

Other automakers, such as Nissan and Volkswagen, have also touted pure electric cars as viable zero-emission vehicles for the future. California's zero-emission vehicle mandate has driven industry effort on battery power in recent years.

The Toyota FT-EV II concept features a solar-powered recharge system and no steering wheel or accelerator pedals, instead using hand controls to control the vehicle. The company is also developing hybrid vehicles, such as the Avalon XLE Premium I, which combines a 2.5-liter engine with two electric motor-generators.

In Japan, the government is pushing for subsidies and tax breaks to bring the cost of fuel-cell cars down to around $20,000 by 2025. The country aims to create 100 hydrogen fuel stations by the end of March 2016.

Overall, Toyota's shift towards mass-producing long-range EVs marks a significant change in its strategy, as the company seeks to adapt to changing market demands and regulatory requirements.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
In 2012, Tesla Motors completed a $100 million supplier agreement with Toyota to provide electric batteries and drive trains for an all-electric version of the Rav4 compact SUV. This partnership marked a significant step forward in sustainable mobility.

The development of environmentally friendly cars has gained momentum, with hybrid vehicles becoming increasingly popular. Hybrid cars use gasoline in addition to a battery and motor to power the automobile, reducing consumption and emissions. Toyota's Prius is one of the most popular hybrids available.

Global electric vehicle (EV) sales reached 549,000 in 2016, increasing by 72.83% year-on-year. China sold 331,100 EVs, with a year-on-year surge of 343%. The future global and Chinese EV markets are expected to maintain rapid development pace.

Mitsubishi's next-generation Lancer Evolution will feature a hybrid powertrain, including a diesel-electric system. This move aims to reduce emissions and improve sustainability.

BMW is advancing automotive sustainability through its expansion into the electric vehicle business. The company is pursuing ""electro-mobility,"" a concept that goes beyond traditional electric vehicles.

Toyota has released patents on hydrogen fuel cells, aiming to jumpstart the transition to a ""hydrogen economy."" However, the production of hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars is still expensive and not yet commercially viable.

The lithium-ion battery technology has become increasingly popular in hybrid electric vehicles, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional nickel-metal hydride batteries.

Article 1 - close encounters
we were just another family living on long island in the late 1960's, but we were also the family from another planet. although the books of archbishop fulton j. sheen decorated our shelves, they were little more than props from the days when our faith-doubting father sought catholic church blessing to marry our mother, an irish farm girl who had been orphaned and then air-mailed to relatives in brooklyn. and for every one of these unopened books about the mysteries of our faith, there were 10 about the mysteries of our universe: u.f.o.'s, extrasensory perception, reincarnation and other subjects tiptoeing into blasphemy. our father may have looked like the typical wall street salesman, commuting daily on the long island rail road, but he was not. his pessimistic worldview, cemented by a depression-era childhood, was tempered by an optimistic belief in extraterrestrial life that was rooted in the same lousy childhood. he corresponded with other conspiracy theorists, collected photographs of plausible sightings and even participated in a panel discussion on the subject at hofstra university, while his children sat in the back of the auditorium, eating french fries and basking in the reflected glory of a father finally being recognized for his mastery of a potentially world-shaking discipline. the pursuit of u.f.o.'s became integral to our family life. there were late-night phone calls, strange packages in the mail and unsettling discussions lasting until

Article 2 - america’s war for reality
exclusive: the united states has been on a three-decade binge of unreality, imbibing delusions that began with ronald reagan and have continued through the tea party. the challenge now is for rational americans to show they have the toughness and tenacity to fight for the real world — and to save it, writes robert parry. by robert parry the real struggle confronting the united states is not between the right and the left in any traditional sense, but between those who believe in reality and those who are entranced by unreality. it is a battle that is testing whether fact-based people have the same determination to fight for their real-world view as those who operate in a fact-free space do in defending their illusions. these battle lines do relate somewhat to the right/left divide because today’s right-wing has embraced ideological propaganda as truth more aggressively and completely than those on the left, though the left (and the center, too) are surely not immune from the practice of ignoring facts in pursuit of some useful agit-prop. but key elements of the american right have set up permanent residence in the world of make-believe, making any commonsense approach to the real-world challenges nearly politically impossible. the right’s fantasists also have the passions of true-believers, like a cult that gets angrier the more its views are questioned. so, it doesn’t matter that scientific evidence proves global warming is real; the deniers will insist the facts are simply a government p

Article 3 - save the date
admit it. you’ve fantasized about time travel. you’ve wondered what it would be like to visit your own past and slap some sense into your younger self. perhaps you’ve imagined having dinner with leonardo, or sitting in the emperor’s box in the roman colosseum. young readers, too, understand the allure. while there is no shortage of children’s books on the subject (my older son became a reader thanks to jon scieszka’s “time warp trio”), “infinity ring: a mutiny in time,” by james dashner, manages to cut a fresh channel in the well-worn time stream. “infinity ring” is planned as a seven-book series with six different authors, of which “a mutiny in time” is the first. dashner, author of “the maze runner,” has outlined the story arc based on a concept developed in-house at scholastic, and will write the seventh and final volume in addition to the first. (i should mention i worked with scholastic on “the 39 clues,” which was created in roughly the same fashion.) like “the 39 clues,” “infinity ring” provides an opportunity for stealth education, as it plunges readers into the past and encourages them to think about cause and effect. the publisher has also provided a multiplatform experience to support the books, including a web site with games that allow young readers to pursue their own time-travel adventures. the concept behind the series:

Article 4 - adrift with a tiger and the film god
“i loved the book,” he said, “but it’s very hard to crack. i thought you can’t make a movie about religion but it can be a movie about the value of storytelling and how that brings structure and wisdom to life. this is a coming-of-age story. it’s about taking a leap of faith.” photo this isn’t material that immediately screams 3-d, but mr. lee decided on that format before he started writing the script. his style has been described as “emotionally resonant (in human relationships) and visually splendid (in the natural world),” by whitney crothers dilley, the author of “the cinema of ang lee.” the “life of pi” trailer features almost otherworldly visuals of animals, fish and starlit skies, but for mr. lee the key was to balance the spectacle with “the delicate moments.” “there is a certain perception about 3-d, but just because nobody has made an intimate movie with it doesn’t mean it can’t be done,” he said. the filming of “life of pi” began with a two-week shoot in india in march 2011. after 10 days in pondicherry, where the story opens, mr. lee moved to munnar, a sleepy small town in the hills of south india. indian filmmakers, especially from the tamil- and malayalam-language industries, often shoot in munnar, but these were the first 3-d cameras to arrive

Article 5 - in the face of death
to the editor: re christopher hitchens’s review of “point to point navigation,” by gore vidal (nov. 26): as a potential old and ill person, i find hitchens’s view that stoicism in the face of death is what “we should all want to emulate” dismayingly typical of the pressure our society places on the old and ill. such simplistic, one-size-fits-all advice shows scant respect for the many people who find it more appropriate to rage against the dying of the light. felicia nimue ackerman providence, r.i. the writer is a professor of philosophy at brown university.

Article 6 - a boy’s life, guided by the voice of cosmic wonder
no matter. for me, with the receipt of that letter, a circle had been closed. now it has opened again, and i have lost a distant grandfather of sorts. to the world at large arthur c. clarke was probably best known as the co-creator with stanley kubrick of the classic 1968 movie “2001: a space odyssey,” a visual tone poem featuring a malevolent computer named hal and a pair of astronauts in search of a mysterious monolith that seems to be the key to the origin and evolution of humanity. but clarke* was much more than a science fiction writer. a genuine rocket scientist, he predicted in 1945 in the journal wireless world that satellites in geosynchronous orbits would be used as “extra-terrestrial relays” for broadcasting to the earth below. the concept he had been pushing for the last few decades, of an elevator to space, might yet become a reality. as he said last fall on the 50th anniversary of sputnik, people stopped laughing at it a long time ago. to space fans and perpetual adolescents everywhere he was simply the deceptively dry voice of cosmic wonder. few writers have seemed to inhabit the cosmos, its grandeur, mystery and, yes, its ultimate coldness, with such aplomb, from the balletic spaceships and the mysterious fetus of “2001” to the jesuit astronaut in the mischievous short story “the star.” the astronaut

Article 7 - eternal whimsy
photo when it comes to theories of the afterlife, most of the world’s major religions have fairly prosaic stuff on offer. only occasionally will a cosmology be really colorful, as it is in greek mythology, where some interesting eschatological options are available. why there should be such a failure of the imagination on this topic is an interesting question. perhaps we feel uncomfortable in such speculation? perhaps we feel that it’s a waste of time to talk about something people have very fixed ideas about — or dismiss as simply wishful thinking? but speculating about who, if anyone, created us and what lies ahead of us can be intellectually engaging and, as david eagleman shows in his new book, “sum,” very entertaining too. the author, a neuro­scientist with literary leanings, has set out a series of possibilities for the afterlife, described in 40 vignettes, each of which presents a different explanation of who god is and why he or she (or, in some cases, they) chose to create us, and what might be planned for us on our demise. and, for the most part, these intentions are very different from what conventional religion would have us believe. most of these future options are extremely amusing, highlighting our self-importance and subjecting us to an astonishing range of humiliations, disappointments and surprises. if you are thinking of dying, this book may not exactly increase your peace of mind. consider some of eagleman’s playfully

Article 8 - homeownership has its perils
video the dread gathers and surges while the blood scarcely trickles in “the conjuring,” a fantastically effective haunted-house movie. set largely in 1971, it purports to tell a story based on “true case files” about a family of seven whose pastoral dream became a nightmare soon after they moved into a rhode island farmhouse. one day, mom, dad and the girls are settling into their conveniently sprawling, creaking, squeaking two-story house — the rooms quickly become a disorienting maze — and the next, they’re playing hide and creep with a mysterious, increasingly malevolent force. the director james wan plays much the same game with you. written by the brothers chad hayes and carey w. hayes, the movie opens with a jittery, funny prologue involving a couple of pretty nurses right out of a roger corman quickie, a devil doll named annabelle (shades of rod serling and chucky) and a pair of married paranormal experts, ed and lorraine warren (patrick wilson and vera farmiga). the warrens quickly take care of business, and mr. wan does the same. with shock cuts, gliding camera movements, muted colors that evoke david fincher’s “zodiac” and tricks learned from “the twilight zone,” mr. wan — whose first sly shot is of a cracked, smiling face — sets a relentlessly uneasy tone that imperceptively shifts between intense seriousness and lightly

inside the dallas cowboys: tony romo and miles austin may join the injury list % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by todd kaufmann nfl writer the dallas cowboys couldn’t afford another injury. not this early in the season. unfortunately for the boys in blue, they may have to do just that. already without star wide receiver dez bryant and cornerback mike jenkins, they may have to face the second straight season without quarterback tony romo on the field. last week against the san francisco 49ers, it was learned that romo had suffered fractured ribs and a punctured lung. on 105.3 fm the fan in dallas this week, owner jerry jones did not admit that he knew of romo’s injury but, then again, he didn’t deny knowing about it either. if the cowboys knew of the situation, most would call the team’s actions “reckless” for allowing the quarterback to return to the game. there was a good chance the injury could have gotten a lot worse. though there is speculation that romo will not play, if he does, redskins defensive back deangelo hall made it clear he’s going to aim his helmet at “whatever is hurt.” “romo’s ribs — i’m going to be asking for some corner blitzes,” hall told the washington post. “if i know felix jones’ shoulder

Article 1 - cowboys de gregory facing year-long suspension: report | reuters
sports news | fri nov 11, 2016 | 2:39pm est cowboys de gregory facing year-long suspension: report (the sports xchange) - dallas cowboys defensive end randy gregory, already serving two suspensions totaling 14 games for multiple violations of the nfl's drug policy, now may be facing a year-long suspension. gregory has failed another drug test, sources informed of the situation told the nfl network. gregory served a four-game suspension to start the season for his first substance-abuse violation and is currently serving a 10-game suspension for violating the league's policy for a second time. the defensive end's next suspension will be for a full year. the report would mean he has failed a sixth test -- his fifth while a member of the cowboys. the nebraska product tested positive for marijuana at the nfl scouting combine in 2015. gregory checked himself into a treatment center during the summer but reportedly later left the facility and missed a scheduled drug test. a missed test carries the same weight as a failed test. gregory, who turns 24 later this month, was placed on the reserve/did not report list and did not take part in training camp. the cowboys selected gregory late in the second round in 2015 with the 60th overall pick. he played in 12 games last season but had little impact, compiling 12 tackles with no sacks.

Article 3 - cowboys end aikman era with a whimper
the cowboys, who do not have a first-round draft pick, had to waive aikman by yesterday or pay him a $7 million bonus and extend his contract through 2007. aikman will still count for $10 million against the $67.4 million salary cap next season, and that will force the cowboys to slash players from the roster to get under the cap. ''in the end it was in the best interest for him to have a timely opportunity to entertain all of his options,'' jones said. the cowboys are left with only anthony wright, who started and lost two games last season, and clint stoerner, who was 3 of 5 in one game last year, remaining on their roster at quarterback. tony banks, who lost the starting job in baltimore last season, has visited the cowboys. dallas may also be interested in trent dilfer, who wrested the job from banks and led the ravens to a super bowl title. but the cowboys may not be able to afford any veterans and may have to pick up a quarterback through the draft. ''as far as what's in the best interest of this club long term, the right thing was done,'' aikman said. his final play as a cowboy ended in a concussion when he was thrown to the ground by washington linebacker lavar arrington in the first quarter of a victory over the redskins on dec. 10. newsletter sign

""opposite side of the building,"" wade said. ""i really did not know where to go."" once he got inside, everything — the sense of direction, the emotions, even the competitive juices — all came back to him. wade played in miami as an opponent for the first time, he and the chicago bulls making their lone appearance of the season in the arena where he was revered for years and before a crowd that let him know time and time again how much he's still appreciated.

Article 6 - for cowboys, mood swings are just another part of their seesaw season
after replacing the benched drew bledsoe in the second half of the giants’ game, quarterback tony romo made his n.f.l. starting debut in the cowboys’ game at charlotte. the 26-year-old romo, who is as even-tempered as parcells is emotional, rallied the cowboys from a 14-point deficit against the panthers on the strength of a 25-point fourth quarter. the day after the victory against carolina, parcells sounded less like a man on the verge of retirement than a golfer who birdies the 18th hole after making a mess of the first 17. he said he would take the abuse “i took in this business twice a day for about two years to feel just like i did last night once.” photo the dark clouds were back the next week after a 22-19 loss to washington in which terrell owens dropped a pass that probably would have gone for a 74-yard touchdown. mike vanderjagt’s potential game-winning 35-yard field goal with seconds left was blocked and a face-mask penalty by the cowboys’ kyle kosier on the ensuing return made possible the redskins’ winning kick with no time left. “it is trying on me,” parcells said, referring to his team’s mistake-prone play. “it is, there’s no doubt. but that’s the way the game is.” the cowboys’ next game was at arizona

Article 8 - coaching changes sparked broncos’ turnaround on defense
how tough is a defensive switch for a player? in 2002, the chargers brought in marty schottenheimer and with him a new coaching staff. marcellus wiley, then a premier pass rusher in his second season with the chargers, suddenly found himself lining up directly against a tight end, something he hadn’t done in 2001, when he had 13 sacks. wiley, now an analyst for espn, had just six sacks in the new system, a production drop he blames in part on his injuries but mostly on his difficulty adjusting to the new defense. “it is tough on a player,” wiley said. “it forces you to refocus and concentrate on the playbook. you’re not familiar with all the terminology of the defense and the subtleties. it takes time to realize what you’re doing, but great players realize it’s also about what your teammates are doing. talent does trump all, but if you’re put into proper position, that helps. scheme is important.” the same goes for new orleans, which has won in recent weeks — including over the jets — with defense instead of its explosive offense. gregg williams, hired in january, brought an aggressive, attacking style to new orleans, which already played a 4-3, and he benefited from the addition of safety darren sharper, who has five interceptions. williams has given sharper plenty of freedom, allowing him to jump pass routes,

The summary also mentions that thousands of FARC fighters have been left in limbo by the rejection of the original peace accord, which is consistent with the article's mention of rebels being extorting people and carrying weapons. There are no significant contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made in the article are supported by the information provided in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","Recent developments in various regions have led to significant events and agreements. In Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) denied reports of being weakened, with their leader Ivan Marquez stating that the group is not weakened. This comes after the release of 10 hostages held for over a decade.

In Mali, Tuareg separatist groups accepted a ceasefire agreement with the government following clashes that threatened to plunge the country back into war. The agreement was reached after a meeting between African Union officials and separatist groups in northern Mali.

Fierce clashes have erupted in Syria's city of Homs, with Syrian forces firing heavy machine guns and launching an airstrike on a neighborhood seized by rebels. The fighting has sent civilians fleeing the area, and hundreds of people were killed in the violence last year.

Colombia's FARC guerrilla group announced that it would release its last 10 military and police hostages, with the release scheduled to begin on April 2. The group designated CCP as the entity facilitating the transfer.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, security forces killed at least 14 members of separatist sect Bundu Dia Kongo (BDK) during clashes in Kinshasa and southwestern city of Matadi.

A hunger strike by prisoners at Corcoran prison ended without negotiations between prisoner reps and authorities. The strike was marked by force-feeding attempts.

In Mozambique, the rebel movement Renamo signed a ceasefire with the government ending two years of armed conflict. Chief negotiators from the government and Renamo signed the declaration in Maputo.

A deal between Sudan's government and rebel groups has been met with criticism, with many arguing that it neglects the concerns of the majority of Darfur people. The agreement was seen as a ""deal with a devil"" by some, who argue that peace cannot be achieved without respecting human rights and dignity.","Colombia's government and Marxist rebels signed a revised peace accord, aiming to end 52 years of conflict. The agreement was rejected in a referendum last month but is expected to be approved by Congress. A bilateral ceasefire has been broken for the first time since its implementation, with two rebels killed in combat.

The accord includes provisions to disarm rebels, who have been extorting people and carrying weapons. Rebels were ordered to stop offensive military activities, including sabotage, as part of a two-month cease-fire announced earlier. The government and rebels are set to sign the final agreement on Thursday.

A majority of Colombians support peace talks with Marxist rebels, but doubt that a new accord will be reached this year. A poll showed 77% want a negotiated solution, while only 19% support a military solution. The government is fighting to salvage the peace deal and extended meetings with opposition leaders.

The conflict has killed over 220,000 people and displaced millions. President Juan Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the conflict.

farc leader claims it is not weakened % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc), the marxist rebel group that is both the largest and oldest in the country, denied reports that it has been weakened, days after it released 10 hostages who were held for more than a decade. in a video that was posted on youtube in recent days, the group’s leader, ivan marquez, said farc “is not weakened,” as claimed by colombian president juan manuel santos. the video showed what appeared to be a few hundred men clad in military uniforms shouting slogans and raising their weapons in the air in a densely wooded area. farc is considered a terrorist organization by the u.s., the european union, and colombia and has battled with colombia’s army for five decades. the group has been blamed for a number of kidnappings as well as drug trafficking in the country and is said to be holding a large number of hostages, although the exact number is unclear. the group is also believed to have employed or is using child soldiers, torture, and has committed extrajudicial killings, which have affected a number of nearby civilians, according to a united nations report in 2005. farc is also believed to have used antipersonnel mines—a weapon that is mostly internationally banned—and to have used terrorist attacks that have killed a number of civilians

Article 1 - two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says
09pm gmt two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says bogota two marxist farc rebels were killed in combat and another surrendered in colombia's northern bolivar province when they left their pre-determined zone carrying weapons, the military said on wednesday, the first time the bilateral ceasefire has been broken. colombia's government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) signed a peace accord in september that was rejected in a plebiscite last month. the two sides finalised a revised deal over the weekend that aims to end 52 years of conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. thousands of farc fighters have been left in limbo by the rejection on oct. 2 of the original peace accord. until they disarm, rebels remain in predetermined areas and must provide coordinates to the military if they want to leave. the rebels were extorting people in the area some 68 km (42 miles) from the area of concentration and carrying weapons, the military said in a statement. a decision on how the new accord will be approved has not yet been made, but it appears more likely to go through congress rather than face another national vote. president juan manuel santos ordered the ceasefire with the rebels in august.

""we have the unique opportunity to close this painful chapter in our history that has bereaved and afflicted millions of colombians for half a century,"" the president said in a televised address. the government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) have been in talks in havana, cuba for the last four years, hammering out a deal to end a conflict that has killed more than 220,000 and displaced millions in the andean country. the government published the revised peace deal last week in a bid to build support after the original draft was rejected in an oct. 2 referendum amid objections it was too favorable to the rebels. santos and londono signed the original deal two months ago in an emotional ceremony before world leaders and united nations secretary general ban

Article 5 - rebel group in colombia announces cease-fire
bogotá, colombia — colombia’s main rebel group announced a unilateral two-month cease-fire on monday, as guerrilla representatives sat down with government negotiators in havana for peace talks aimed at ending a nearly 50-year war. the government did not immediately respond to the cease-fire announcement. president juan manuel santos has repeatedly said that his government would not declare a truce during negotiations with the group, the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, known as the farc. he hopes to avoid mistakes made in an earlier round of talks that ended in 2002, in which the farc used a lengthy truce to gain strength. the two-month cease-fire was announced by the head of the farc negotiating team, iván márquez. reading a communiqué, he said all guerrilla units in colombia were ordered to stop offensive military activities, including the sabotage of infrastructure, beginning tuesday and lasting until jan. 20. the communiqué, which was posted on the farc’s web site, said that the cease-fire pledge was meant to “strengthen the climate of understanding necessary so that the parties that are starting the dialogue achieve the purpose desired by all colombians.” advertisement continue reading the main story the government’s head negotiator, humberto de la calle, said before leaving bogotá for havana on sunday that “there will be no concessions of a military character nor a cease-fire.”

Article 6 - colombian's peace pursuit: part carrot, part stick
indeed, had mr. pastrana decided to end the demilitarized zone, it would have meant abandoning peace efforts and dislodging a well-equipped rebel army that has become firmly rooted. ''to do away with it would be doing away with the most important program of the pastrana administration, which is the peace process,'' said armando borrero, a political scientist and former national security adviser to president ernesto samper, who was mr. pastrana's predecessor. still, no one is arguing that the talks have produced much in the way of tangible results or that the outlook is rosy. supporters of mr. pastrana's administration say he has taken great steps to build an environment of trust in which peace talks could flourish. in early november, he announced the creation of a peace coalition with the opposition leader horacio serpa. in recent speeches, the president has also spoken passionately about the need to resume talks and avoid war. the short time frame is meant to put pressure on the rebels, giving them a closing window for rejoining peace talks. right now they have been at a peak of their strength, but their critics say that the paramilitary forces are pounding them and that government actions to take away their drug trade are bound to have some effect. in talks leading up to the decision wednesday, mr. pastrana consulted a cross section of government officials and others familiar with the conflict to shore up political support. newsletter sign up continue reading the

Article 7 - majority of colombians back peace talks but see no deal this year: poll
by julia symmes cobb bogota (reuters) - a majority of colombians support peace talks with marxist rebels but they also doubt that the government will be able to reach a new accord with the country's largest guerrilla group this year, a poll showed on thursday. the gallup poll was published a month after a landmark peace deal with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia, or farc, was unexpectedly rejected in a referendum. the gallup poll showed that 77 percent of colombians want a negotiated solution to the 52-year conflict with the farc, while only 19 percent support a military solution. but voters rejected a signed peace deal with the farc by less than half a percentage point in the shock result of an oct. 2 referendum, meaning it could not be implemented. opponents of the accord, reached after four years of intense negotiations, said it was too lenient on rebels who had committed crimes. many voters also opposed provisions that gave the guerrillas seats in congress. the government and rebels alike had said the accord was the best that could be achieved. but the government is now fighting to salvage the peace deal and extended meetings this week with the right-wing opposition, led by former president alvaro uribe, which backed the 'no' vote in the plebiscite. government peace negotiators were also due to travel on friday to havana, cuba, where the talks took place, to continue meetings with the far

''some people had lost legs. others were headless. everything was destroyed.'' antonio navarro wolff, a senator who was in the congressional chamber for the inaugural, said: ''we thought it was cannon shots that were part of the ceremony. it was an hour later when we understood that it was an attack and there were many dead and wounded.'' the ceremony was not interrupted, and mr. uribe made no mention of the attacks in his 20-minute nationally televised speech that began about half an hour after the first shells were fired. ''this conflict either ends or it has the potential to destabilize the region,'' mr. uribe said in his address. mr. uribe, 50, a former state governor who was educated at harvard and oxford, was swept into office on may 26 after campaigning as a no-nonsense candidate who would double the size of the armed forces to take control of territory lost to the farc, as the rebel group is known. mr. uribe is expected to forge a closer relationship with the

Title: two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says
Content: two colombian farc rebels killed in combat, military says 36pm bogota (reuters) - two marxist farc rebels were killed in combat and another surrendered in colombia's northern bolivar province when they left their pre-determined zone carrying weapons, the military said on wednesday, the first time the bilateral ceasefire has been broken. colombia's government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) signed a peace accord in september that was rejected in a plebiscite last month. the two sides finalised a revised deal over the weekend that aims to end 52 years of conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. thousands of farc fighters have been left in limbo by the rejection on oct. 2 of the original peace accord. until they disarm, rebels remain in predetermined areas and must provide coordinates to the military if they want to leave. the rebels were extorting people in the area some 68 km (42 miles) from the area of concentration and carrying weapons, the military said in a statement. a decision on how the new accord will be approved has not yet been made, but it appears more likely to go through congress rather than face another national vote. president juan manuel santos ordered the ceasefire with the rebels in august.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Recent developments in various regions have led to significant events and agreements. In Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) denied reports of being weakened, with their leader Ivan Marquez stating that the group is not weakened. This comes after the release of 10 hostages held for over a decade.

In Mali, Tuareg separatist groups accepted a ceasefire agreement with the government following clashes that threatened to plunge the country back into war. The agreement was reached after a meeting between African Union officials and separatist groups in northern Mali.

Fierce clashes have erupted in Syria's city of Homs, with Syrian forces firing heavy machine guns and launching an airstrike on a neighborhood seized by rebels. The fighting has sent civilians fleeing the area, and hundreds of people were killed in the violence last year.

Colombia's FARC guerrilla group announced that it would release its last 10 military and police hostages, with the release scheduled to begin on April 2. The group designated CCP as the entity facilitating the transfer.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, security forces killed at least 14 members of separatist sect Bundu Dia Kongo (BDK) during clashes in Kinshasa and southwestern city of Matadi.

A hunger strike by prisoners at Corcoran prison ended without negotiations between prisoner reps and authorities. The strike was marked by force-feeding attempts.

In Mozambique, the rebel movement Renamo signed a ceasefire with the government ending two years of armed conflict. Chief negot

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Colombia's government and Marxist rebels signed a revised peace accord, aiming to end 52 years of conflict. The agreement was rejected in a referendum last month but is expected to be approved by Congress. A bilateral ceasefire has been broken for the first time since its implementation, with two rebels killed in combat.

The accord includes provisions to disarm rebels, who have been extorting people and carrying weapons. Rebels were ordered to stop offensive military activities, including sabotage, as part of a two-month cease-fire announced earlier. The government and rebels are set to sign the final agreement on Thursday.

A majority of Colombians support peace talks with Marxist rebels, but doubt that a new accord will be reached this year. A poll showed 77% want a negotiated solution, while only 19% support a military solution. The government is fighting to salvage the peace deal and extended meetings with opposition leaders.

The conflict has killed over 220,000 people and displaced millions. President Juan Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the conflict. A new accord will be submitted to Congress for approval, rather than put to another referendum.

* The Republican Senate has set a record for the fewest confirmations of lifetime judicial appointees, giving President-elect Trump significant sway over the courts.
* Merrick Garland's questionnaire reveals anti-gun stance, potentially overturning Justice Scalia's Heller ruling.
* Democrats are unlikely to filibuster Neil Gorsuch's nomination due to Mitch McConnell's refusal to open up the ""nuclear option"".
* The Republican platform opposes taxpayer-funded abortions and declares the unborn child has a fundamental right to life.
* A trial of President Obama could be held in two phases, with televised grand jury indictments for various controversies.
* Senate Republicans blocked Caitlin Halligan's confirmation due to her activist views on gun rights and terrorism.

These points highlight key events, positions, and controversies discussed in the articles.","The US Supreme Court is facing a significant shift in its ideological makeup, with President Trump's potential nominees expected to further conservative leanings. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been under pressure to consider nominations, despite concerns about the impact on the court's balance.

President Obama's record suggests a more ideological approach to the courts than he has portrayed. His voting record indicates a preference for liberal judicial philosophy, which may be reflected in his potential nominee. However, the nomination process is expected to be contentious, with some Democrats seeking to block conservative nominees.

The Senate has been divided on the issue, with some Democrats opposing the confirmation of certain nominees. The committee's chairman, Senator Grassley, has faced pressure from within his own party to consider more conservative options.

The potential nominee, Judge Pryor, is seen as a strong contender for the position, but his views on issues such as abortion and gun control are likely to be contentious. The nomination process is expected to be closely watched, with implications for the court's balance and the country's legal landscape.

In contrast, President Obama's past actions suggest that he may have been more willing to consider conservative nominees in order to secure their support in future elections. However, this approach has not been reflected in his current record as a nominee.

democrat senator confuses real life with an episode of “west wing” (before it's news) i always find the most amusing people on the political spectrum to be the moderates who are, allegedly, just trying to get people to get along. they typically come in two flavors. you have republicans who have political power but seem embarrassed by the idea that they are winning and so they try to dilute their power and influence by giving some to democrats. the other flavor, of course, is rabidly partisan democrats who are out of power and trying to regain it by convincing the previously mentioned republicans to be reasonable and share it with them. donald trump has a unique opportunity to reshape the american judiciary… if he acts and can prevail upon mitch mcconnell to act. mitch mcconnell’s refusal to confirm many of president barack obama’s judicial nominees has set the table for donald trump to dramatically reshape the judiciary over the next four years, as the republican senate set a modern record for the fewest confirmations of lifetime judicial appointees. the senate gop confirmed just 20 lifetime judicial appointments to district and appeals courts in its two years in the majority, the lowest number by far in the past 28 years, according to a congressional research service report obtained by politico. that means that president-elect trump will have major sway over the courts next year, starting with the supreme court and going all the way down to the district level.

surrender: republicans preparing to confirm obama’s radical supreme court nominee % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) fellow conservative, merrick garland submitted his “questionnaire” to the senate for consideration today and it is far worse than we thought. we already know that garland ruled that the government has a right to keep a registry of american gun owners even though the law explicitly prohibits it (nra v reno). he also voted against re-hearing seegars v gonzales, proving that he does not believe the 2nd amendment should protect an individual right to keep and bear arms. if he is added to the bench, then he becomes the vote that would overturn justice scalia’s groundbreaking heller ruling. the list of garland’s anti-gun cases is long. but with his submission today, his anti-gun stance is just the beginning. he has ruled against the 1st amendment’s free speech protections (wagner v fec), in favor of terrorists held in guantanamo bay (parhat v gates), he let a drug trafficker out of prison on a technicality (us v gaskins), and most ridiculously, he once ruled that if a corporation purchases land and plans to develop it, the government can come in and stop the entire project for its environmental impact (rancho viejo, llc v. norton). the questionnaire that garland submitted has hundreds of citations for past

Article 3 - three reasons democrats won’t filibuster the neil gorsuch scotus nomination
three reasons democrats won’t filibuster the neil gorsuch scotus nomination (before it's news) donald trump kept another campaign promise with the nomination of neil gorsuch to the supreme court. trump said he was going to replace antonin scalia with somebody similar to scalia and he did just that. it was a fine choice, and the hysterical, childlike “nyah nyah!” tweets from idiots like sean hannity to national review, bill kristol, and the wall street journal, it is a choice that will unite republicans, at least temporarily. the question now is whether or not democrats are going to move ahead with a filibuster of gorsuch’s nomination. mitch mcconnell has already indicated he will not open up the “nuclear option” to supreme court nominees. the gop majority is only 52 seats which require the defection of eight democrats to get to the 60 vote quorum threshold to move gorsuch’s nomination to the floor of the senate for the confirmation vote. left-wingers are already shouting they want democrats in the senate to filibuster the nomination. people who wouldn’t know merrick garland from adam are suddenly invoking his name as though the rightful heir to the supreme court was denied his seat (what is it with the left and their entitlement mindset, anyway?). i get the feeling democrats are not going to filibuster the nomination or make any more than a

[i]f you help me win this race you may have someone with your background, your experience, your voice, someone who’s been literally fighting tort reform for thirty years, in a visible or public way, on the senate judiciary committee. or, you might have a farmer from iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law, serving as the next chair of the senate judiciary committee. because, if democrats lose the majority, chuck grassley will be the chair of the senate judiciary committee. heaven forbid iowa famers end up with an iowa farmer representing iowa farmers’ interests at the highest levels of government. the people who really matter are those most practiced in the art of harumphing. i could smell the cigars and brandy leaking right out of that youtube, and possibly a pipe and monocle or two. now that’s some gubbmint right there. democrats are for the people don’t you know. and people, as you may not be aware, live in dc, new york, or la., have community organized at some point, or at least have law degrees. everyone else is just so much chattel as far as democrats are concerned. pawns. children to be led but not listened to. seen but not heard

platforms offer a stark choice (before it's news) platforms offer a stark choice by phyllis schlafly august 3, 2016 the republican and democratic parties adopted new platforms at their conventions last month, and they have fundamentally different plans for america’s future. the two major party platforms have not been this different from each other in our lifetimes. a platform should be a statement of principles that can last for many years, not a partisan political attack against a particular candidate. the republican party platform has only one reference to hillary clinton and barely mentions republican candidates of the past or present, while the democratic party platform rants against donald trump 32 times. the democratic party platform wants federal taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, and for the first time calls for repealing the 40-year-old hyde amendment which limits federal spending on abortion. the republican party platform opposes the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortion and declares that “the unborn child has a fundamental right to life.” the vacancy of conservative justice antonin scalia hangs in the balance in this election, and the democratic party platform tells us what their top priority is. when selecting the next supreme court justices and all future nominations to the federal bench, democrats promise to appoint judges who will “protect” the abortion industry. the republican platform explains that there is “a national crisis in our judiciary” due to activism by democrat-appointed federal judges. “only a republican president will appoint judges who respect the rule

(before it's news) j. andrew peak, the black sphere: the prosecution of barack obama: in our system, the media is to function as the protectorate of the people. it is what the founders intended. they, as the fourth estate (and unofficial branch of government) are the backstop to tyranny. when the cornerstones of all other public institutions tremble under the weight of injustice (as they do now); the matter should be tried in the court of public opinion. and it should be done on television to provide a forum conducive to a public hearing. thus far, many outlets have continually failed in this charge. it is their job to fill the void. chief among the duties of the media is to educate and inform a free people. so how best to accomplish this, while at the same time attempting rescue of institutions that are politically compromised and derelict in their duty? in the age of reality television, what better than a trial of a president? the people vs. barack obama should be held in two phases. the first phase could be a televised, one hour, grand jury indictment for each matter: obamacare fraud during passage, its ongoing rewriting and the disparate application thereof; benghazi; fast and furious; irs scandal; nsa scandal; corruption, etc., etc., etc. if

senate republicans block controversial obama judicial nominee with troubling views on gun rights, terrorism (before it's news) today, senate majority leader harry reid (d-nv) forced a cloture vote on president obama’s nominee to the dc circuit court of appeals, caitlin halligan. senate republicans opposed her confirmation, and the vote failed, 54-45. unfortunately, halligan has a controversial record with activist views on the 2nd amendment and the war on terror. as senate republican leader mitch mcconnell explained, “in ms. halligan’s view, the courts aren’t so much a forum for the even-handed application of the law as a place where a judge can work out his or her own idea of what society should look like. as she once put it, the courts are a means to achieve ‘social progress’, with judges presumably writing the script.” leader mcconnell pointed out, “on the second amendment: as solicitor general of new york, ms. halligan advanced the dubious legal theory that those who make firearms should be liable for third parties who misuse them criminally.” in a 2003 decision discussing her theory, the new york court of appeals wrote that her complaint, on behalf of then-attorney general eliot spitzer, “claims that illegally possessed handguns are a common-law public nuisance.” but the court dismissed the idea, saying, “the new york court of appeals has never recognized a common-law

Article 1 - blaming the chief justice
even before the trump-focused blame game started, chief justice roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right’s favorite punching bag. in a rambling speech on the senate floor last month, senator charles e. grassley, the iowa republican who heads the judiciary committee, defended the republican refusal to move forward with president obama’s nomination of judge merrick b. garland to fill the supreme court’s vacant seat. playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before justice antonin scalia’s unexpected death, to the effect that the senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, senator grassley said it was the roberts court itself that was political. “physician, heal thyself,” he said, and then offered this observation: justices appointed by republicans are generally committed to following the law. there are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. but some of the justices appointed by republicans often don’t vote in a way that advances conservative policy. in other words, could it be that the problem with chief justice roberts is that he isn’t sufficiently political in the right direction? that was certainly the message gov. greg abbott of texas sent last month when called the chief justice “the tip of the spear in playing politics.” in remarks at the heritage foundation, he explained: “chief justice john roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote obamacare twice. what we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played

Article 2 - in america; high stakes
voters may not pay much attention to potential supreme court appointments, but interest groups sure do. and the national rifle association, the right-wing religious organizations, anti-abortion zealots and other extremist wanderers of the nation's far-right terrain are praying that george w. bush becomes president and gets to appoint two or three more clarence thomases or antonin scalias to the court. there are no more liberals on the supreme court, just moderates and conservatives. and one important decision after another has been determined by a slender 5-to-4 majority. last week, in a 5-to-4 decision, the court struck down a provision of the violence against women act that allowed victims of rape, domestic violence and other crimes ''motivated by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal court. the times, in an editorial, said the ruling ''left women more vulnerable to gender-motivated violence.'' the headline on the editorial was ''violence against the constitution.'' voters who care about civil rights and civil liberties, about abortion rights or gun control or campaign finance reform, about protecting the environment or protecting the cherished liberties enshrined in the first amendment -- such voters would do well to pay close attention to the possible makeup of the supreme court in the very near future. advertisement continue reading the main story many of the rights and liberties that americans have come to take for granted over the past few decades are now in the cross-hairs and well within range of the right

Article 3 - building legacy, obama reshapes appellate bench
the full appeals court agreed this month to hear halbig v. burwell, a case that could unravel the system of federal insurance exchanges established by the affordable care act. before democrats curtailed republicans’ right to use filibusters, which they accomplished by rewriting senate rules through a maneuver known as “the nuclear option,” the district of columbia court was dominated by judges who were appointed by republican presidents. today it has four republican appointees and seven democratic appointees, four of whom mr. obama picked. with control of the senate at stake in november’s midterm elections, the success of democrats in reshaping the courts is a reminder of the subtle power that the majority party has even in a moribund congress. republicans, who have watched with growing alarm as the obama nominees passed through the senate, have begun raising the issue as they try to win six seats they need to take the majority. “it’s no surprise that president obama has been able to transform the ideological makeup of the courts — that happens when you have six years to pick judges and your party controls the senate,” said edward whelan, the president of the ethics and public policy center, who was a senior official in the justice department under president george w. bush. “the best way for conservative voters to prevent further damage to the courts is to swing the senate to republican control in the elections this november.” though the obama administration was well on its way to leaving a lasting liberal

(cliff owen / associated press) david g. savage will soon have the chance to make good on one of his most consequential campaign promises: fill the supreme court vacancy with a judge in the mold of conservative icon justice antonin scalia , who died in february. any trump nominee is almost guaranteed to be a conservative jurist who is anti-abortion and supports the 2nd amendment’s right to bear arms. but what kind of conservative he selects will determine whether his first nominee will be quickly confirmed or instead trigger a fierce fight in the closely divided senate, potentially overshadowing the early months of trump’s presidency. if trump opts for a scalia-like justice, as he repeatedly said he would during the campaign, conservatives lawyers say the betting favorite is judge william h. pryor jr. from the 11th circuit court in atlanta, a former alabama attorney general who called the roe vs. wade decision legalizing abortion the “worst ab

pushing back against the conservatives, democrats noted that mr. biden had spoken in june 1992, much closer to november, and that year’s presidential election, than now. and his sentiments were hypothetical, since no vacancy occurred in the last months of the first bush administration. they were also expressed in the aftermath of the brutal nomination fights over robert h. bork and justice clarence thomas. mr. biden said in a statement monday that the intent of his 1992 speech was to urge an end to partisan differences over the court, not to oppose filling vacancies in an election year. but his remarks had the potential to severely undercut one of the best arguments of the obama administration and senate democrats. senator charles e. grassley, the iowa republican who is chairman of the judiciary committee and has been under heavy pressure to consider any nominee, could not say enough monday about mr. biden’s remarks. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. “as my colleagues and i grapple with how the senate judiciary committee should approach this set of circumstances, we seek guidance and wisdom from a number

Article 6 - scouring obama’s past for clues on judiciary
mr. obama’s voting record suggests a more ideological approach to the courts than he has portrayed, as well as a keen awareness that votes for bush nominees considered too conservative by liberal groups could become fodder for an attack ad against him in a democratic presidential primary, where the party’s liberal base would hold particular sway. sheldon goldman, a political science professor at the university of massachusetts, amherst, who studies judicial selection, said, “we must never forget that barack obama is a politician.” his supreme court pick, mr. goldman said, may shed light on how to interpret his senatorial record. “if he picks someone with a judicial track record that is in accord with a more liberal judicial and political philosophy, then i think in retrospect we’ll see that yes, that was very important to him and it’s very consistent with his behavior as a senator,” mr. goldman said. mr. obama, who became a senator in january 2005 and declared his presidential candidacy two years later, did not play a leading role in fighting mr. bush’s nominees. but as a former law instructor, he was deeply engaged in preparing for those votes, said michael strautmanis, who was mr. obama’s senate counsel and now works in the white house. “he was not on the judiciary committee and he was a freshman senator, so he could have given it scant attention,” mr. strautmanis said. “but he went

Article 7 - in setting priorities, democrats give up confirmation battle
senator patrick j. leahy, the vermont democrat who will become the chairman of the judiciary committee and who led the opposition to mr. olson's confirmation, said today in an interview that his priority would now be to block any judicial nominees put forward by president bush who were so conservative they would tip the balance of the federal courts. ''we shouldn't allow any president to engage in ideological court-packing, either from the right or the left,'' mr. leahy said. even though mr. olson won confirmation, the vote was close, 51 to 47. only two democrats voted in favor of the nomination -- senators zell miller of georgia and ben nelson of nebraska -- a fact that surprised senate republicans and the white house. it was closer than the 58-to-42 vote in which john ashcroft was confirmed as attorney general in february after a bruising five-week confirmation battle. after conferring over the last two days, senator leahy and senator tom daschle of south dakota, who will become the majority leader, decided this morning that it was best not to try to block the olson nomination, congressional officials said. ''there was a growing sense that making olson our first big stand was not a wise move,'' one senior democratic staff aide said. the aide said the democrats decided that getting mr. olson's nomination out of the way would provide an initial appearance of bipartis

Article 8 - goodbye to all those hopes for a new, liberal supreme court
goodbye to all those hopes for a new, liberal supreme court and farewell, merrick garland. cristian farias legal affairs reporter, the huffington post alex wong/getty images the highly qualified merrick garland is not going to be a supreme court justice. judge merrick garland was possibly hoping that americans would choose hillary clinton as their next president and thus push the republican-controlled senate to quickly confirm him to the supreme court . any such hope collapsed tuesday night. the election of donald trump made it virtually impossible for president barack obama’s nominee to be elevated to the nation’s highest court. and that means democrats are once again denied a dream they’ve held for a generation : to see a liberal tilt in the supreme court’s membership. with trump as president, republicans, who spent millions to keep control of the senate , can also secure their grip on the high court for years to come ― by naming justices who are more conservative and far younger than the 63-year-old garland. the goal will be to fill not just the seat left vacant by the death of justice antonin scalia , but also any additional vacancies that may open up. the supreme court is growing older ― justice ruth bader ginsburg is 83, justice anthony kennedy is 80, and justice stephen breyer is 78 ― so another empty seat is certainly possible over the next four years. tom williams/cq roll

Content: photo even though the supreme court has been an active player in american politics — bush v. gore leaps quickly to mind — the process of choosing its members has been seen as mattering more than the partisan combat in congress. with rare exceptions, nominees to the court have been largely insulated from the escalating political warfare over the judiciary, and have been approved. justice antonin scalia, a conservative standard-bearer, was confirmed with 98 votes. ruth bader ginsburg, a liberal icon, got 96. even clarence thomas, whose confirmation hearings marked a flash point in sexual and racial politics, drew no filibuster. now, however, partly as a result of its own actions, but more important as a result of increasing polarization in washington and the nation as a whole, the court is devolving into a nakedly partisan tool. how did this happen? some of the blame rests with the democrats. many of them over the years have played to their base by casting cost-free votes against republican nominees. republicans like to say that democrats’ 1987 blocking of robert bork marked the beginning of the politicization of supreme court nominations, but democrats did give mr. bork a vote. the polarization of the court itself, with a pronounced rightward swing among its conservatives, has also helped turn confirmations into political battles. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from op-ed columnists, the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. but the lion’s share of the blame now belongs to one man — mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader. in blocking even a hearing for judge merrick garland, president barack obama’s moderate and eminently qualified candidate, as well as dozens of obama nominees for other positions, he deeply degraded the nominating process. there was a time when the leaders of the senate were responsible stewards of republican traditions and ideals. not mr. mcconnell, whose determination to steamroll and humiliate political opponents exceeds any other consideration. advertisement continue reading the main story which brings us — and the nation — to the unfolding mess in the senate over president trump’s nomination of judge neil gorsuch. on monday, senate democrats secured the votes needed to filibuster judge gorsuch’s nomination, a procedural mechanism the senate minority party can use to stall or block a vote by the majority. whether democrats will or will not remains to be seen. but many of them are still furious, and rightly so, that

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Key points:

* A Democrat senator has expressed confusion between real-life events and an episode of ""The West Wing"".
* The Republican Senate has set a record for the fewest confirmations of lifetime judicial appointees, giving President-elect Trump significant sway over the courts.
* Merrick Garland's questionnaire reveals anti-gun stance, potentially overturning Justice Scalia's Heller ruling.
* Democrats are unlikely to filibuster Neil Gorsuch's nomination due to Mitch McConnell's refusal to open up the ""nuclear option"".
* The Republican platform opposes taxpayer-funded abortions and declares the unborn child has a fundamental right to life.
* A trial of President Obama could be held in two phases, with televised grand jury indictments for various controversies.
* Senate Republicans blocked Caitlin Halligan's confirmation due to her activist views on gun rights and terrorism.

These points highlight key events, positions, and controversies discussed in the articles.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US Supreme Court is facing a significant shift in its ideological makeup, with President Trump's potential nominees expected to further conservative leanings. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been under pressure to consider nominations, despite concerns about the impact on the court's balance.

President Obama's record suggests a more ideological approach to the courts than he has portrayed. His voting record indicates a preference for liberal judicial philosophy, which may be reflected in his potential nominee. However, the nomination process is expected to be contentious, with some Democrats seeking to block conservative nominees.

The Senate has been divided on the issue, with some Democrats opposing the confirmation of certain nominees. The committee's chairman, Senator Grassley, has faced pressure from within his own party to consider more conservative options.

The potential nominee, Judge Pryor, is seen as a strong contender for the position, but his views on issues such as abortion and gun control are likely to be contentious. The nomination process is expected to be closely watched, with implications for the court's balance and the country's legal landscape.

In contrast, President Obama's past actions suggest that he may have been more willing to consider conservative nominees in order to secure their support in future elections. However, this approach has not been reflected in his current record as a nominee.

The Senate's decision on the nomination is expected to be closely watched, with implications for the court's balance and the country's legal landscape. The potential nominee's views on issues such as abortion and gun control are likely to be contentious

in washington dc (before it's news) i am in washington dc today for a world war two museum board meeting. yesterday, i rented a bike share for $$7 and rode around the monuments. it’s a fantastic way to get around dc. the traffic isn’t used to bikes yet though! occasionally, i had to get up on the sidewalk to avoid trucks and buses. one of the things the museum does at board meetings is tell some stories. they not only tell stories about the big war, but they tell stories about how the museum was founded. those stories become the culture of the entity. it’s very important for startup companies to tell stories from time to time too. knowing where you came from if presented the right way will guide people to where they should aspire to go. the word of mouth is passed from generation to generation of worker. great old companies tell each new class of employee where they have been and where they are going. startups should too. the museum was founded in 2000. it’s an extremely entrepreneurial museum, and one of the reasons i like working for it. it started with an idea. they had a couple of early pivots. their customers told them what they wanted, and they marshaled the resources to get there. they continue to recruit and find new resources to grow. most of the money has come from private donations. the museum does a lot with education and stem. after all, ww2 created some incredible entrepreneurial stories. here is how the

Article 1 - berlin art complex rises from a brewery’s ruins
“neukölln is more grass-roots than other, more artistically established neighborhoods in berlin,” said andreas fiedler, the center’s swiss-born curator. “but here are a lot of artist spaces and a lot of artists produce here.” “the success of berlin as a center for artists is because of who is here, who has been here, and the freedom that is based on the myth of the ‘90s,” he continued, referring to the decade after the fall of the berlin wall when the city exploded with art and refurbishment. “it’s still a very liberal city, and you can realize here what you can’t necessarily in other parts of europe.” that is evident in the main hall of the art center, the only room currently open to the public, where a two-seat yellow plane dangles from the 20-meter, or 65-foot, ceiling of the former boiler house of kindl beer. the facility’s massive room helped to draw the installation that will anchor the new art center’s first phase. “kitfox experimental,” by the 76-year-old swiss artist roman signer, who is known for his outrageous outdoor installations, is an assemble-yourself airplane (the popular kitfox brand), with two large fans blowing from opposite walls to move the plane in a circular motion. it hangs upside down, spinning from the force of the fans, and their deafening sound adds to the almost movielike sense that the plane is spiraling

Article 5 - the great new show moma doesn't want you to see
there's an eclectic exhibition of contemporary paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs and videos up at the museum of modern art, but don't go looking for it. though the museum's new building greatly expanded the public gallery space, this show -- the 2006 edition of the museum's staff art show -- is tucked into the corners and corridors of the fourth and fifth floors, where only curators and administrators are allowed to tread. the employees-only concept is something of a tradition at art institutions around the city. the whitney's version, which coincides with the staff holiday party in december, takes up roughly a hallway and a conference room. metropolitan museum of art workers get prime real estate, like the second-floor galleries that housed the van gogh drawings. the frick's artist-staff members are given a modest spot, like the library reading room. and christie's actually opens its affair to the public (in posh ground-floor galleries, to boot). then again, its display goes up in august, when much of the art world is on vacation. moma's staff show is usually every two years, and everyone from guards to curators can submit something. as long as the work is less than 3 by 4 feet and was made in the last two years, it's in. the display is equally democratic. an abstract painting by robert storr, the former senior curator of paintings and drawings and the next curator of the venice biennale, is hung,

Article 6 - viennese tales from the berkshire woods
called the secession, it held its own exhibitions and found a steady source of patronage in the city's wealthy bourgeois elite. in line with his outsider status, klimt worked a bit at being a character. he took to dressing in blue, muumuu-like floor-length smocks inside and outside the studio, and had himself photographed in them, looking soulful. i've always had trouble with klimt's iconic figurative paintings. their insistent visual flash looks as hard and sleek as the surface of a credit card; their sexiness seems lacquered over and their byzantine theatricality slightly silly and already old-fashioned. (it's useful to remember that cubism was being invented in paris at the same time.) but the 15 landscapes in the clark show, organized by stephan koja, a curator at the galerie belvedere in vienna, are different. they aren't particularly innovative paintings: they are basically a goulash of impressionism, symbolism and 19th-century austrian realism. but they have an appealing elasticity and fleetness, and a sense of unmystical mystery. they share the sensuality of klimt's pattern-wrapped figures, but add breath and a pulse. many of the landscapes were done during klimt's annual summer stays in the austrian and italian countryside; he painted them for himself, not on commission. the earliest in the show are near-abstract expanses of flickering water

Article 7 - a curtain maker who challenges the view
next to her, hanging on the door to her office, was a poster with a quotation by tristan tzara, the dadaist poet. ''i have a mad and starry desire to assassinate beauty,'' it read. ''the old kind, of course.'' also on the door was a postcard of sculpture by richard serra and a zipper, sewn into a swatch of fabric, that makes a perfect right angle. it is difficult to imagine, in speaking to her, that ms. bright hasn't made a note to herself, somewhere on a list, to reinvent the wheel. ms. bright, whose studio of three, including mr. paskin, is working on curtains for new york residences for christy turlington, the model, and janice and billy crystal, is not an interior designer, though she understands what gives style and life to a room. and she is not an architect, though she has introduced much of architecture's discipline and invention into her craft. she is, in a weird 19th-century sense that won't go away, simply a curtain maker, here in the 21st century. the studio, with its eight sewing machines, two wall-mounted grommet makers, chart-size samples and 30-foot-long worktable with a battery of yardsticks, looks like a war room where what is being waged is drapes.

Content: yet most festivals also program events with a broader appeal to attract design enthusiasts as well as professionals. and the most culturally ambitious festivals, like those in vienna and gwangju, have emerged as impromptu training grounds for a new generation of design curators in leading museums. one of the most dynamic festivals is dutch design week, which will stage more than 400 events in eindhoven from oct. 17 to 25. eindhoven has emerged as a global center of design experimentation as students have flocked to design academy eindhoven, europe’s most influential design school, and stayed in the city after graduation to set up studios in the derelict factories and warehouses offered to young designers for low rents by the local council. several hundred thousand people travel to eindhoven each year to explore the city’s design scene during dutch design week. few other places have as strong a design ethos, or such staunch political support, yet other festivals have tried to develop distinctive strands of programming (as vienna design week has done with passionswege). photo a recurrent theme of beijing design week, for example, is the regeneration of dashilar, one of the few surviving historic areas of the city. young chinese designers show their work there during the festival alongside exhibitions celebrating dashilar’s craft heritage. craft is also a focus of design week mexico, which will run from oct. 21 to 25 in mexico city with the first of a series of exhibitions exploring the artisanal skills of particular regions, starting with chiapas in southern mexico. an annual highlight of the brussels design september festival is europe’s biggest flea market for late 20th-century design, the brussels design market. more than 100 european dealers will descend on the city this weekend to sell their wares in an early 1900s harbor station. the most popular features of the london design festival, which began in 2003, are its collaborations with the city’s museums. during this autumn’s festival, running from sept. 19 to 27, the british designer max lamb is to exhibit at the somerset house cultural center the furniture he has made from a single ash tree on his grandfather’s farm. an exhibition at the victoria & albert museum, meanwhile, will explore the experimental objects made from wood by the late robin day, one of britain’s best known 20th-century furniture designers. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the quality of the projects in the bigger festivals, like london’s and brussels’, is so erratic that navigating the events can be tricky. the london festival hopes to strengthen its program by introducing

8518030.0,reliable,reliable,0.9,106.88330817222597,True,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY in several ways. Firstly, both summaries mention economic inequality as a pressing issue and highlight its impact on society. They also discuss research findings, such as the wealth concentration among the top 1% (Oxfam) and the importance of education in predicting future earnings. Additionally, both summaries touch on historical parallels between current economic conditions and past periods of significant social change.  The only potential discrepancy is the mention of ""liberal economists"" arguing that the US should lean against the market to preserve decent living standards for working and poor people, which is not explicitly mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. However, this point is also present in the article itself, suggesting that it may be a minor error or omission rather than a significant contradiction.  Overall, the similarities between the article and the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY suggest that the article is likely to be reliable, with a confidence level of 0.9.","The US economy has become increasingly unequal since the 1980s, with the top 1% accumulating most of the wealth. This is linked to religiosity, as countries with high levels of economic inequality tend to be more religious. Research by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty found that income concentration in the US has increased significantly.

Poverty in America is exploding, with over 150 million people considered poor or low-income. The gap between the wealthy and the poor is at an all-time high, leading to a ""Robin Hood mentality"" and rising anger among the poor. Despite unprecedented government borrowing and money printing, poverty continues to worsen.

Foreign aid to poor countries may actually harm more than help, as it can corrupt governments and slow growth. The US has shifted its foreign policy towards using ""soft power"" instead of military presence, but this approach risks perpetuating corruption.

The 2017 wealth generated by the global economy was largely concentrated among the top 1%, with the poorest half seeing no increase in their wealth. This is part of a broader trend of increasing economic inequality and declining social mobility.

In New York City, Washington D.C., and San Francisco, economic conditions are improving, but almost everywhere else, they are getting worse. The middle class continues to decline, and many Americans are forced to work multiple jobs just to survive.","Economic inequality is a pressing issue, with countries like Sweden experiencing high levels of equality but potentially stifling entrepreneurship and growth. Research suggests that a rough trade-off exists between equality and growth, with some economists arguing that too much equality can lead to unemployment and deficits.

The wealthiest 80 individuals in the world own as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population, according to Oxfam. However, this statistic is often misinterpreted, and the actual share of global wealth held by the richest 1% is significantly higher.

A recent poll found that Americans are optimistic about social mobility, with three-quarters believing it's possible to move up a class. However, more than half thought it unlikely they would become wealthy. The federal government should tax estates worth over $3.5 million, according to the poll.

Historical parallels exist between the current economic boom and the early 20th century, when globalization led to rapid social change and increased income inequality. This led to a ""gilded age"" plutocracy and the passage of sweeping tariffs, such as the Smoot-Hawley Act in 1930.

Research suggests that cleverly designed redistribution can benefit the poor without harming growth. However, significant increases in inequality can drag on the economy and affect everyone. Christian scholars agree that income inequality is not inherently unchristian or unjust, so long as the poor can produce enough wealth to sustain themselves.

Overall, economic inequality remains a complex issue, with no clear solution. However, research suggests that a balance between equality and growth is necessary for sustainable prosperity.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

the free market that isn’t (before it's news) “since 1980, the u.s. government has reduced its intervention in the u.s. economy, which has become much more of a free market. conservatives applaud this development because they think that free-market outcomes reward talent and hard work; progressives object to the income inequality of free-market outcomes and want to use government tax and transfer policy to reduce inequality.” true or false? this is a conservative framing of the story of what has happened to the u.s. economy since the early 1980s, writes university of notre dame economics professor marty wolfson in dollars & sense. it plays into the notion that conservatives are defenders of an economic system that awards success based on merit. it holds that the poor and middle classes should work to emulate—not vilify—the rich, and that those who refuse to play along and instead demand a reduction in inequality via a redistribution of wealth are parasites on a fair system. the argument, wolfson writes, “assumes that the outcomes we observe are the result of a free-market economy. however, the right-wing objective has not been to create a free market; it has been to rig government policy and the market so as to redistribute income towards large corporations and the wealthy.” humane values demand that the sum of this con game, described below, be made clear to the public that has been duped by it, and that those who can work to restore genuine fairness by changing the rules of how the

29 incredible facts which prove that poverty in america is absolutely exploding % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) did you know that the number of americans on welfare is higher than the number of americans that have full-time jobs? did you know that 1.2 million public school students in the u.s. are currently homeless? anyone that uses the term “economic recovery” to describe what is happening in the united states today is being deeply insulting to the nearly 150 million americans that are considered to be either “poor” or “low income” at this point. yes, things are great in new york city, washington d.c. and san francisco, but almost everywhere else economic conditions continue to steadily get worse. the gap between the wealthy and the poor is at a level that america has never seen before, and this is beginning to create a “robin hood mentality” that could cause a tremendous amount of social chaos in the years ahead. anger at the “haves” in america continues to rise at a very alarming pace, and the “have nots” are becoming increasingly desperate. at some point all of this anger is going to boil over, and you won’t want to be anywhere around major population centers when that happens. despite unprecedented borrowing by the federal government in recent years, and despite unprecedented money printing by the federal reserve, poverty in the united states keeps getting worse with each passing year. the following

Article 7 - foreign aid to poor countries could hurt more than help
foreign aid to poor countries could hurt more than help (before it's news) part of the big plan for re-aligning the foreign policies of the united states involves an increase in the use of “soft power” (using money, technology, and infrastructure development) and a decrease in the use of “hard power” (military presence, training, and supply). china has been making gains in their foreign policy front by using soft power to a tremendous degree and gaining allies in unstable regions of the world. the united states, under barack obama in particular, has tried (and largely succeeded) in removing the united states as a military power and focusing on making its presence in the world overall much softer. however, there is a risk in such politics. the places that need the money in order for soft power to work tend to be led by people who, if not already corrupt, are easily corrupted by a sudden influx of wealth. this argument is expanded on by a winner of the nobel prize for economics, angus deaton. deaton argues that, by trying to help poor people in developing countries, the rich world may actually be corrupting those nations’ governments and slowing their growth. according to deaton, and the economists who agree with him, much of the $$135 billionthat the world’s most developed countries spent on official aid in 2014 may not have ended up helping the poor.

Article 8 - bernie sanders supporters explain what they really want
as we head toward the democratic national convention, i often hear the question, “what does bernie want?” wrong question. the right question is what the 12 million americans who voted for a political revolution want. and the answer is: they want real change in this country, they want it now and they are prepared to take on the political cowardice and powerful special interests which have prevented that change from happening. they understand that the united states is the richest country in the history of the world, and that new technology and innovation make us wealthier every day. what they don’t understand is why the middle class continues to decline, 47 million of us live in poverty and many americans are forced to work two or three jobs just to cobble together the income they need to survive. what do we want? we want an economy that is not based on uncontrollable greed, monopolistic practices and illegal behavior. we want an economy that protects the human needs and dignity of all people – children, the elderly, the sick, working people and the poor. we want an economic and political system that works for all of us, not one in which almost all new wealth and power rests with a handful of billionaire families. the current campaign finance system is corrupt. billionaires and powerful corporations are now, through super pacs, able to spend as much money as they want to buy elections and elect candidates who represent their interests, not the american people. meanwhile, we have one of the lowest voter

Article 1 - the inequality conundrum
countries like sweden are more equal, but to some economists, they are probably too equal. there is a rough trade-off between equality and growth: if you try too hard to make everyone equal, you get fewer entrepreneurs, fewer silicon valleys and a lower standard of living. freeman, who is generally pro-union, says sweden’s converging pay scales led to unemployment and deficits in the early ’90s, when it belatedly moved to create more incentives. similarly, gary becker, a nobel-winning economist, recalls visiting factories in communist china in 1981: the workers were all lazing around. now china has billionaires and the country is growing like topsy. you can boil down most economic policy debates — starting with hamilton versus jefferson and moving to bush versus the democrats — to this tension: how can you promote equality without killing off the genie of american prosperity? the trade-off is clear at the extremes but fuzzier in the middle. a little redistribution, cleverly designed, doesn’t hurt. one example might have occurred during the late ’90s. the stock market was crowning multimillionaires, but the poor also did a little better. among households with children, cash earnings of the poorest quintile doubled (though their earnings, at $13,000, remained meager and have tapered off more recently). most of the improvement at the bottom was because of people working more hours rather than for higher wages: a red-hot

Article 3 - hollywood’s class warfare
but — if i may sloganize further — which side are you on? there is no doubt that in the past year, through seasons of economic malaise and political anger, there has seemed to be a lot more division than consensus in american life. and this friction is often articulated and analyzed in what sounds like the language of class. not in the old european (or, god forbid, socialist) sense of the word. the history of the world might be, as karl marx said, the history of class struggle but the history of american exceptionalism insists otherwise. so we have instead, at this moment in history, a culture war, a battle between populism and elitism, a sectional conflict between the coasts and the heartland and ideological dispute between liberals and conservatives. photo this confused hobbesian state of belligerence, a prominent feature of the media and political landscape for at least the past decade (though rarely reflected in mass-marketed movies), is persuasively sketched in jonathan franzen’s “freedom,” surely the year’s most talked- and written-about novel. its main characters are the members of a proudly, perhaps smugly, right-thinking — which is to say left-leaning — minnesota family whose veneer of social responsibility and liberal niceness is shattered by external fissures and internal pressures. walter and patty berglund are do-gooders and gentrifiers, nutritionally and environmentally conscious npr listeners (and readers of

Article 4 - what does the bible say about income inequality?
(photo: screen grab via youtube/politizane) an infographic depicting america's income inequality. christian scholars agree that the unequal distribution of income is not inherently unchristian or unjust, so long as the poor can produce enough wealth to sustain themselves. ""i think that a good, short statement of a biblical definition of economic justice is that god wants every person and every family to have access to the productive resources, so that if they act responsibly they can earn their own way and be productive members of society,"" ron sider, distinguished professor of theology, holistic ministry & public policy at palmer theological seminary, told the christian post on wednesday. ""i am not arguing for equality of income and wealth,"" sider stated, bluntly. jordan ballor, research fellow at the acton institute and executive editor of the journal of markets & morality, agreed with sider that income inequality is not inherently unbiblical. ""the challenge is distinguishing natural inequalities, which arise out of the variety of human gifts and talents, from unrighteous and unjust inequality,"" ballor explained. ""we are going to make different amounts, but it doesn't mean that we are unequal in god's eyes,"" anne bradley, vice president of economic initiatives at the institute for faith, work, and economics (ifwe), told cp on wednesday. she argued that the fundamental measure of how the poor fare in society isn't the distribution of income, but income mobility — a person's ability to find

Article 5 - still poor, latin americans protest push for open markets
the backlash has given rise to leftist politicians who have combined pocketbook issues and economic nationalism to explosive effect. today the market reforms ushered in by american-trained economists after the global collapse of communism are facing their greatest challenge in the upheavals sweeping the region. ''the most worrying reading is that perhaps we have come to the end of an era,'' said rafael de la fuente, chief latin american economist for bnp paribas in new york. ''that we are closing the door on what was an unsuccessful attempt at orthodox economic reforms at the end of the 90's.'' for a time the policies worked, and many economists and politicians say they still do. the reforms increased competition and fueled growth. stratospheric inflation rates fell back to earth. bloated bureaucracies were replaced with efficient companies that created jobs. the formula helped give chile the most robust economy in latin america. in mexico exports quintupled in a dozen years. in bolivia, poverty fell from 86 percent of the population in the 70's to 58.6 percent today. still, the broad prosperity that was promised remains a dream for many latin americans. today those same reforms are equated with unemployment and layoffs from both public and private companies, as well as recessions that have hamstrung economies.

Article 6 - we can’t blame a few rich people for global poverty
it’s a breathtaking statistic: the richest 80 people in the world own as much wealth as the poorest half of the entire planet. it’s the centerpiece of oxfam’s latest campaign, timed to coincide with the touching down of several of those billionaires in davos for the world economic forum last week. it’s also a brilliant talking point because it gives the impression that a happy few are hogging a big chunk of the world’s resources. photo but don’t be misled; this is not what it says at all. a less rhetorically gifted oxfam staffer might have written instead that the world’s richest 80 people own around 0.7 percent of global wealth. that’s a lot, but it hardly seems staggering. the global distribution of wealth the share of global wealth held by the richest 80 people is actually quite small, compared to the wealth held by larger group of the richest 1 percent. poorest tenth 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th 90th-95th 95th-99th richest 1%* richest 80 people -0.3% 0.1% 0.1% 0.3% 0.5% 0.8% 1.4% 2.6% 7.1% 11.7% 27.5% 47.4% 0.7% poorest

Article 7 - the poll results
to discover how americans regard class and where they place themselves, the times conducted a nationwide survey in march. the poll uncovered optimism about social mobility. it found differences in the views of rich and poor in some areas, including the likelihood of achieving the american dream. the poll was followed by interviews with respondents, including the four people pictured above, chosen to represent different economic groups. marjorie connelly chart: ''a land of opportunity'' more than ever, americans cherish the belief that it is possible to become rich. three-quarters think the chances of moving up to a higher class are the same as or greater than 30 years ago. still, more than half thought it unlikely that they would become wealthy. a large majority favors programs to help the poor get ahead. compared with their social class when growing up, people said their current class was: lower: 16% no answer: 2% higher: 45% same: 38% compared with 30 years ago, is the likelihood of moving up from one social class to another: less: 23% no answer: 2% greater: 40% same: 35% the federal government should tax estates worth: over $3.5 million: 20% no answer: 7% not at all: 50% over $1 million: 23% is it possible to start out poor, work hard and become rich? graph tracks yes or no answers since 1983. how likely

Article 8 - when borders close
continue reading the main story the parallels between the two booms are striking. the recent advance of globalization was driven by changing technology — including container ships and the internet — and new rules that opened the world’s most populous country, china, to commerce. before 1914, steamships and the “victorian internet,” the telegraph, as well as novel rules that opened the 19th century’s largest economy, britain, to imports, drove globalization. by the eve of world war i, the world was in some ways as connected as now. measured as a share of the population, immigration to the united states was three times greater in 1914 than at any time since. advertisement continue reading the main story the social tensions generated by rapid globalization in the early 20th century also ring familiar. the share of income going to the richest 1 percent of americans rose steadily from 1870 to a peak of nearly 20 percent in the late 1920s, as global commerce created a “gilded age” plutocracy. popular resentment spread, and politicians began working to seal the borders, particularly after 1929, when the economy crashed into the great depression. america turned inward. congress passed the sweeping smoot-hawley tariff act in 1930, prompting a global trade war. measured as a share of the world economy, trade peaked at 30 percent in 1914, and fell to a low of 10 percent in 1933

Title: grounded by an income gap
Content: but where economists split is whether anything should be done about the divide. ''the question is whether you lean against the wind of the market to try to preserve decent living standards for working and poor people,'' mr. freeman said. ''europe and japan are leaning against the wind.'' many liberal economists say the united states should, too. levels of equality and inequality play a large role in people's sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their lot in life, said ronald inglehart, a sociology professor at the university of michigan, who for 30 years has been conducting something called the world values survey. ''interestingly the levels of dissatisfaction are highest in both the most equal countries in the world, the communist countries or those that have just emerged from communism, and also those with very high levels of inequality,'' he said. the only way you can achieve total equality is through coercion, he said, which makes people feel they have no control over their lives and no way to benefit from their labor. but highly unequal, extremely stratified societies, where people feel crushed by the economic power of others, breed similar dissatisfaction. conservative economists insist that the problem with the new economy is not that some people make a lot of money but a series of noneconomic factors that are holding others back. ''the problem is not inequality but poverty,'' mr. feldstein said. poor education, the breakdown of the family and what he terms ''low cognitive ability,'' together, may be responsible for holding back many of those mired in persistent poverty. he added that some poor people may choose not to work as hard as investment bankers working 70 hours a week, or to skip school, and so earn less. james heckman, a professor of economics at the university of chicago, argued: ''we have to look at some of the basic structural reasons why we have so many unskilled, poorly educated, poorly motivated people in our society. one of the most amazing phenomena of recent years is why so many people, especially minorities, have not responded to the opportunities out there. there has been a big increase in demand for skills, educated blacks have done very well, but college completion rates have leveled off.'' perhaps never before, economists say, has education been such an important factor in predicting future earnings. marvin kosters, a senior economist with the american enterprise institute, a conservative think tank in washington, said the earning advantage for those who attend college over those who do not has doubled to about 60 percent from 30 percent in the early 1970's. ''even finishing high school improves your income by about 30 percent,'' mr. heckman said. one of the biggest reasons people fail to finish school is teenage pregnancy and the strains of running a household as a single parent. ''more than 40 percent of all female-headed families with children had incomes below the poverty line,'' prof. marc l. miringoff of fordham university writes in his recent book, ''the

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Economic inequality is a pressing issue, with countries like Sweden experiencing high levels of equality but potentially stifling entrepreneurship and growth. Research suggests that a rough trade-off exists between equality and growth, with some economists arguing that too much equality can lead to unemployment and deficits.

The wealthiest 80 individuals in the world own as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population, according to Oxfam. However, this statistic is often misinterpreted, and the actual share of global wealth held by the richest 1% is significantly higher.

A recent poll found that Americans are optimistic about social mobility, with three-quarters believing it's possible to move up a class. However, more than half thought it unlikely they would become wealthy. The federal government should tax estates worth over $3.5 million, according to the poll.

Historical parallels exist between the current economic boom and the early 20th century, when globalization led to rapid social change and increased income inequality. This led to a ""gilded age"" plutocracy and the passage of sweeping tariffs, such as the Smoot-Hawley Act in 1930.

Research suggests that cleverly designed redistribution can benefit the poor without harming growth. However, significant increases in inequality can drag on the economy and affect everyone. Christian scholars agree that income inequality is not inherently unchristian or unjust, so long as the poor can produce enough wealth to sustain themselves.

Overall, economic inequality remains a complex issue, with no clear solution. However, research

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US economy has become increasingly unequal since the 1980s, with the top 1% accumulating most of the wealth. This is linked to religiosity, as countries with high levels of economic inequality tend to be more religious. Research by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty found that income concentration in the US has increased significantly.

Poverty in America is exploding, with over 150 million people considered poor or low-income. The gap between the wealthy and the poor is at an all-time high, leading to a ""Robin Hood mentality"" and rising anger among the poor. Despite unprecedented government borrowing and money printing, poverty continues to worsen.

Foreign aid to poor countries may actually harm more than help, as it can corrupt governments and slow growth. The US has shifted its foreign policy towards using ""soft power"" instead of military presence, but this approach risks perpetuating corruption.

The 2017 wealth generated by the global economy was largely concentrated among the top 1%, with the poorest half seeing no increase in their wealth. This is part of a broader trend of increasing economic inequality and declining social mobility.

In New York City, Washington D.C., and San Francisco, economic conditions are improving, but almost everywhere else, they are getting worse. The middle class continues to decline, and many Americans are forced to work multiple jobs just to survive.

retail merchandising undergoes major shifts in response to uncertain economy, new study finds (before it's news) rsr research, an analyst firm providing market intelligence on retail technology trends, announces the results of its latest research report, “twenty-first century merchandising takes hold: benchmark 2011.” the research finds that while most retailers report their current merchandising abilities to meet newly-empowered consumers’ needs as “average,” the best performers are making huge strides to pull away from the pack. rsr research’s latest report, “twenty-first century merchandising takes hold: benchmark 2011″ finds the best performers making merchandising huge strides to pull away from the competitive pack. these findings are based on a survey of 82 qualified retailers in the summer of 2011. the report can be downloaded at http://www.retailsystemsresearch.com/_document/summary/1335. the report was sponsored by oracle and sas, with supporting sponsorship from demandtec and predictix. “three significant developments have driven the shift in merchandising,” said paula rosenblum, managing partner at rsr research and co-author of the report. “1) continued exponential increases in computing power makes once theoretical sku-intensive calculations practical, 2) a new breed of merchant has emerged who is comfortable with technology and at ease with handing over once ‘sacred’ tasks to the mechanics of the computer, and 3) an erratic global economy

free market defined (before it's news) it seems that the “free market” is just about everyone’s favorite boogeyman these days, but what, exactly, is the free market? shouldn’t we at least try to define it before assigning blame? the following entry from the fortune encyclopedia of economics (time warner, 1993), david henderson, ed., pp 636-639, by murray n. rothbard should help. what is the free market? the free market is a summary term for an array of exchanges that take place in society. each exchange is undertaken as a voluntary agreement between two people or between groups of people represented by agents. these two individuals (or agents) exchange two economic goods, either tangible commodities or nontangible services. thus, when i buy a newspaper from a news dealer for fifty cents, the news dealer and i exchange two commodities: i give up fifty cents, and the news dealer gives up the newspaper. or if i work for a corporation, i exchange my labor services, in a mutually agreed way, for a monetary salary; here the corporation is represented by a manager (an agent) with the authority to hire. both parties undertake the exchange because each expects to gain from it. also, each will repeat the exchange next time (or refuse to) because his expectation has proved correct (or incorrect) in the recent past. trade, or exchange, is engaged in precisely because both parties benefit; if they did

Article 6 - consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews
consumer staples stock outlook – dec. 2011 – zacks analyst interviews (before it's news) stocks in the consumer staples sector performed their traditional defensive role as the broader equity markets came under pressure over concerns about the prolonged weak u.s. economy and the debt crisis in europe. shares of consumer staples companies, accounting for a total of about 11.4% of the s&p 500 index, were up 5.3%, compared with a 3.3% drop for the s&p 500. in 2010, the sector index grew 10.7% versus a 12.8% increase for the s&p 500 index. the consumer staples companies are typically able to buck sluggish economic growth as food, beverage, household products and cosmetics companies that manufacture and market non-durable consumables, are considered essential to daily life, such as food, drink, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper, etc. although, staples’ earnings are expected to the continue the uptrend of the last quarters going forward, margins will remain under pressure due to elevated food prices. road ahead as referred to earlier, the macro-economic environment remains uncertain. however, we have seen that product demand has remained relatively stable for the companies that are more exposed to fast-growing emerging markets in comparison to the slow-growing developed markets. moreover, favorable foreign exchange translation and lower production costs in developing markets led to higher operating margins than the u.s. therefore, consumer staples companies have out

is tennessee trying to isolate its’ citizens? (before it's news) i just received an email where senator lamar alexander proudly shares that he and other members of state congress have figured out how to collect taxes for online sales. in the email it states that ”for over a decade, congress has been debating how to best allow states to collect sales taxes from online retailers in a way that puts main street businesses on a level playing field with online retailers.” the bill is designed to specifically target internet sales and asks the united states congress to intervene. i have a couple of issues with this bill… first, we chose to purchase online, pay shipping and handling fees and wait for our items because of convenience. it is not cost effective for a person to get out and drive to look for one item. gas prices are ridiculous, we spend hours of time that we could enjoy with friends and family, looking for items and having to tolerate rude customer service. in addition, stores spend lots of money trying to figure out how to make us forget the purpose of our visit, so that we get sidetracked and impulse shop, thus helping us part with more of our hard earned money. so in truth, what local businesses complain is that they cannot take as much advantage of us, when we purchase online. this bill will not “level the playing field” it will make it too expensive to purchase online, so it will limit our options to in-state only. let’s say the bill passes;

4637155.0,fake,reliable,0.9,111.86826491355896,False,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY because it provides specific details about environmental damage caused by mountaintop mining, including the number of miles of streams affected and the impact on forests. Additionally, the summary mentions regulatory issues, such as a federal judge halting projects due to inadequate environmental reviews, which is consistent with the article's mention of regulations being violated due to financial influence from the coal industry.  The FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains several inaccuracies, including an overstatement of the decline in fish species (50% decline) and an unsubstantiated claim about a proposed strip mine releasing toxic pollution into the Black Warrior River. Furthermore, the summary implies that the Appalachian Regional Development Act has failed to stimulate economic growth, which is not supported by the article.  The RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY also provides more nuanced information about the environmental impacts of coal mining, including the effects on water quality and the role of state regulators in addressing these issues. Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY better aligns with the facts presented in the article.","The articles discuss various issues affecting the Appalachian region, including coal mining and its environmental impacts. Mountaintop removal coal mining is causing significant harm to downstream fish populations in streams below mines in West Virginia's Guyandotte River drainage, with a 50% decline in fish species and a two-thirds decline in total fish numbers.

Article 3 - the noble, misguided plan to turn coal miners into coders: new at reason
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! even in coal’s heyday, appalachia was still relatively poor and backward. at the time, policy makers blamed its lack of economic development on mountainous inaccessibility. their solution: end the region’s isolation with massive infrastructure projects, most notably a network of four-lane highways that would connect the region to the rest of the country. so in 1965, president lyndon johnson signed the appalachian regional development act, creating the appalachian regional commission (arc). over the subsequent five decades, arc has spent $27 billion (in 2015 dollars) to build nearly 3,000 miles of the appalachian development highway system that is threaded throughout the mountains. the highways, constructed along officially designated “corridors,” are splendidly engineered—and largely empty. they utterly failed to spark an economic renaissance. despite tens of billions in federal money, the “region’s performance relative to the national average is similar to its position in the 1960s,” reported economists carl kitchens and taylor jaworski in a 2016 study published by the national bureau of economic research. they calculate that the gigantic transportation investment boosted incomes in the region by just $586 per capita. far from being discouraged by this result, policy makers are at it again. this time, they want to drag appalachia into the 21st century over newly installed information superhighways,

Article 4 - appalachian coal losing another customer: competing coal reserves add to regional challenges
appalachian coal losing another customer: competing coal reserves add to regional challenges (before it's news) tva’s kingston fossil plant is one of the many coal-burning facilities in central appalachia’s front yard. yet, many plants in the southeast purchase no coal from appalachia and look to the cheaper powder river and illinois basins instead. photo from tva.com we posted a piece yesterday about the retirement plans for brayton point power station in massachusetts – the most modern coal-fired power plant in new england – and how some are calling its eventual closure a death knell for coal in the northeast. or, as jonathan peress of the conservation law foundation said in a press statement, “if [brayton point] can’t make a go of it, none of them can.” unsurprisingly, the owners of brayton point, like most other utilities that are retiring plants or converting them to burn other fuels, cited the surplus of low cost natural gas and the ongoing market transformation it has caused as major factors in coal plant closures nationwide. the fact that the nation’s natural gas boom is hastening the decline of central appalachian coal is no secret. but it leaves out any mention of the challenge from cheaper coal and competing reserves. when even southeastern utilities that operate coal plants in central appalachia’s front yard look to wyoming’s powder river basin or the illinois basin, it goes beyond the price of operating an aging plant

Article 5 - appalachian coal: strip mine proposal in northern alabama
appalachian coal: strip mine proposal in northern alabama % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the water intake for more than 200,000 residents of birmingham, ala., is just across the river from a proposed strip mine — now withdrawn — that would have released toxic pollution directly into the river, including one discharge location a mere 800 feet away. photos courtesy of black warrior riverkeepers even to those familiar with appalachia’s historically destructive relationship with coal, the proposal for the 1,773-acre shepherd bend strip mine in northern alabama seemed unprecedented. flowing through the mountains of alabama’s largest coal-producing region, the mulberry fork tributary of the black warrior river houses the drinking water intake for more than 200,000 residents in birmingham, ala., nearly 75 percent of whom are black or african-american. just 800 feet from this intake was one of 29 outfall points where drummond company, inc., planned to release toxic mining waste directly into the waterway. drummond is no stranger to controversy. since 2002, the coal mining company has been sued at least four times regarding allegations that it hired the paramilitary gunmen responsible for the kidnap, torture and murder of unionized mine workers and their families at its colombian operations. but until recently, the company faced limited public criticism in its home state of alabama. “the proximity to a major

Article 6 - one fish, two fish … dead fish
one fish, two fish … dead fish headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! usgs study: mountaintop removal decimates fish populations in appalachia a study from researchers at the u.s. geological survey (usgs) published this month provides strong new evidence that mountaintop removal coal mining in appalachia is devastating downstream fish populations. that’s hardly news for long-time followers of the controversy surrounding mountaintop removal, a coal mining practice that involves blowing off the tops of mountains to access thin seams of coal and dumping the waste into valleys below. in 2010, a group of 13 prestigious biologists published a paper in science, the nation’s premier scientific journal, that found: “our analyses of current peer-reviewed studies and of new water-quality data from wv streams revealed serious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot successfully address… clearly, current attempts to regulate [mountaintop removal mining] practices are inadequate.” the authors of the study published last week found a 50 percent decline in the number of fish species and a two-thirds decline in the total number of fish in streams below mountaintop removal mines in west virginia’s guyandotte river drainage. they made this important contribution to the science by using rigorous methodology to isolate several types of water pollution most likely to have caused these staggering declines. but a more important contribution of the study may be that it draws the focus of water pollution impacts away from mayflies and other aquatic insects

Article 1 - mountaintop rescue
mountaintop mining is a cheap and ruthlessly efficient way to mine coal: soil and rock are scraped away by enormous machines to expose the buried coal seam, then dumped down the mountainside into the valleys and streams below. mountaintop mining has also caused appalling environmental damage in violation of the clean water act. according to a federal study, mountaintop removal has buried or choked 1,200 miles of appalachian streams and damaged hundreds of square miles of forests. no recent administration, democrat or republican, has made a serious effort to end the dumping, largely in deference to the financial influence of the coal industry and the political influence of robert byrd, west virginia’s senior senator. but the bush administration has gone out of its way to shield the practice. in 2002 and 2004, the environmental protection agency — confronted with complaints that mountaintop mining violated regulations prohibiting the dumping of mine wastes in streams — simply changed the regulations to allow it to continue. now a federal judge has inspired hopes that this destructive nonsense can be brought to a halt. in a case argued by two advocacy groups, earthjustice and the appalachian center for the economy and the environment, judge robert chambers of federal district court halted four mountaintop removal projects on the grounds that the army corps of engineers — which issued permits for the projects — had failed to demonstrate that the damage would not be irreversible. he also said the corps had failed to conduct the necessary environmental reviews. local

Article 2 - giving advice to a new mayor; hopewell threatened by overdevelopment; my happy youth in jersey city; the sweet pleasures
to the editor: hopewell is rightly proud of our efforts to protect open space and fight sprawl (“holding back the mcmansions,” editorial, oct. 15). but your editorial did not mention that these efforts are threatened by a measure on the local ballot this year. hopewell township ballot question no. 1 would cut the open space fund in half at a time when the price of purchasing open space around here is higher than ever. not only would this measure threaten forests, farms, water and wildlife, but it could have the unintended consequence of leading to even higher property taxes. more development of our unprotected farms and forests would eventually require more school construction, roads, fire and police, and other expensive services. these services would cost a lot more than any new revenue generated by the development. the township government commissioned a fiscal impact study from an economist at the university of pennsylvania that concluded just that. in contrast, purchasing undeveloped land to protect open space and preserve farms is often the most cost-effective action that towns can take to keep property taxes from spiraling even further out of control. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all

Article 3 - setting standards for water
most people don't think about what is in their tap water many would prefer not to know -- but tim mcdonough, the mayor of hope township, can not avoid the issue. ''i don't think a month goes by that we do not receive a report from the county board of health where we have wells being contaminated,'' said mayor mcdonough, whose small, warren county town includes about 700 houses. ''this is a very, very serious problem in this part of the state.'' it is a difficult problem because the pollutants that seep into the ground can eventually make their way into the water system. and while all the state's water systems are safe to drink from, environmentalists and some local officials have been concerned for years about pollution in the groundwater. ''surface water eventually finds its way into the groundwater,'' mr. mcdonough said. ''it does not take long for the water to get down to where people's wells are, and they are bringing it up to drink.'' state regulators are trying to answer mayor mcdonough's concerns. last october, they released the first revision to rules governing groundwater pollution in more than a decade. the regulations, which are scheduled to take effect this spring, will adjust limits for hundreds of chemicals, from ammonia to chromium, and will establish new rules for developers planning to restore polluted areas, called brownfields. the reaction to the new rules has been nearly unanimous: almost everyone is unhappy. business groups are

Article 4 - as the mountaintops fall, a coal town vanishes
a couple of years ago, a subsidiary of massey energy, which owns a sprawling mine operation behind and above the richmond home, bought up lindytown. many of its residents signed massey-proffered documents in which they also agreed not to sue, testify against, seek inspection of or “make adverse comment” about coal-mining operations in the vicinity. you might say that both parties were motivated. massey preferred not to have people living so close to its mountaintop mining operations. and the residents, some with area roots deep into the 19th century, preferred not to live amid a dusty industrial operation that was altering the natural world about them. so the greens sold, as did the cooks, and the workmans, and the webbs ... but quinnie richmond’s husband, lawrence — who died a few months ago, at 85 — feared that leaving the home they built in 1947 might upset his wife, who has alzheimer’s . he and his son roger, a retired coal miner who lives next door, chose instead to sign easements granting the coal company certain rights over their properties. in exchange for also agreeing not to make adverse comment, the two richmond households received $25,000 each, roger richmond recalls. “hush money,” he says, half-smiling. as mr. richmond speaks, the mining on the mountain behind him continues to transform, if not erase, the woodsy stretches he

Article 5 - sierra club foes battle over ouster of leaders
but both sides say the animosity between the two has deeper roots. according to carl pope, executive director of the entire sierra club, there is a long history of bad blood between the new york city group and the state chapter. ''they've had this problem for 20 years,'' he said. ''the people have changed, but they still hate each other.'' the bad feelings apparently intensified four years ago, when the city group opposed the construction of the $390 million hudson river park, despite support for it from the atlantic chapter and many other environmental groups. to moisha blechman and some of the other ousted city leaders, the sierra club as a whole has become part of the ''sellout of the environmental movement.'' the issue at stake in the latest go-around is the financial and political autonomy of the city group. with 12,000 members, the city has more than one-third of the 35,000 members in new york state. new york city's elected leadership has the power to endorse local political candidates, and it decides stances on local environmental issues. a stamp of approval from the sierra club carries considerable weight. ''it's a powerful name,'' said robert f. kennedy jr., founder and director of riverkeeper, an environmental organization that concentrates on the hudson river. ''they have huge constituencies. they're trying to run a true democracy, so it's unwieldy, like herding cats. but they can deliver

Article 6 - challenging history and pollution; onondagas' suit is the largest indian claim in state history
the onondaga nation has about 1,500 members, and its federally recognized territory is an 11-square-mile parcel in a valley south of syracuse and about eight miles from the southern end of onondaga lake. the community maintains its own customs, language and laws and is governed by a council of chiefs, which meets in a traditional longhouse, a large, open room that serves as the spiritual and political center of the community. the territory has four churches, a healing center, a cigarette store, an arena for ice hockey and indoor lacrosse, and one school. some of the nation's adults work full time in their territory while others work outside, in private firms or government offices. the nation's leaders have said that they do not intend to forcibly take away anyone's land in the disputed territory, which is now home to hundreds of thousands of people. they also said that unlike other indian tribes that are pursuing land claims against the state, they are not interested in compensation involving money and casinos. what they want is influence in major policy discussions affecting the ecosystem in their ancestral lands. they also hope to use a favorable judgment to buy land to increase agricultural and housing opportunities, protect ancestors' gravesites and safeguard the environment. ""we came to this point without avarice or any kind of greedy expectation,"" audrey shenandoah, 78, one of the community's clan mothers, said in an interview in the onondaga nation territory.

Article 7 - pcb cleanup may include less dredging
with a decision imminent on dredging pcb's from the upper hudson river, the bush administration is seriously considering a plan to do a fraction of the dredging that the clinton administration proposed last year, democratic elected officials and environmentalists said today. several of the people making that claim said they had heard it from people who had had contact with the office of christie whitman, the environmental protection agency administrator, who will make the decision. but none said they had learned of the plan directly from mrs. whitman's office. mrs. whitman's office did not return two calls today seeking confirmation of the plan. she said last week that she would make a decision by the end of this week, and would send it to the pataki administration for comment. ''it is our understanding that this plan is under serious consideration,'' attorney general eliot l. spitzer said. but when asked whom his sources were, he said, ''i will do everything i can not to edify you on that one.'' advertisement continue reading the main story in december, under president bill clinton, the e.p.a. proposed a clean-up plan whose centerpiece would be dredging 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river at several ''hot spots'' about 40 miles north of here. the cost, estimated at $480 million, would be charged to general electric, the company whose plants dumped polychlorinated biphenyls, or pcb's, a

Article 8 - excerpts from questioning of the interior secretary-designate
senator wyden -- i heard you tell senator bingaman that somebody else would have to go out and file that brief at this point because you support the law as interpreted by the courts. and if you want me to take back what i earlier said, i, frankly, welcome the position that you articulated yesterday to senator bingaman, and we might want to leave it at that. ms. norton -- i will certainly uphold the endangered species act, and the concept of preserving endangered species is something that i view as very important. it's one of the responsibilities of the department of interior that i will vigorously pursue. senator wyden -- preventing more summitvilles. ms. norton -- a very difficult challenge is to determine how we can go forward with utilizing our natural resources and protecting the environmental values of our lands at the same time. summitville was a tragedy for the state of colorado. we dealt with that situation once it had occurred as well as we could. we went into court dealing with obtaining an injunction to prevent the mine operator from walking away from the mine, with going into bankruptcy court to recover as much of the resources as we could to apply those to cleaning up the mine site. we worked with the united states in seeking to ultimately recover from those who were separated from the corporation that had operated the mine but were nevertheless the part owners of that. and so we pursued that case very vigorously. we also learned in colorado that to prevent future problems like that,

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The articles discuss various issues affecting the Appalachian region, including coal mining and its environmental impacts. Mountaintop removal coal mining is causing significant harm to downstream fish populations in streams below mines in West Virginia's Guyandotte River drainage, with a 50% decline in fish species and a two-thirds decline in total fish numbers.

The USGS study found that water pollution from mountaintop removal mining is likely responsible for the declines. Additionally, a proposed strip mine in northern Alabama would have released toxic pollution directly into the Black Warrior River, which supplies drinking water to over 200,000 residents.

Coal mining companies are facing criticism for their practices, including allegations of hiring paramilitary gunmen and releasing toxic waste into waterways. The Appalachian Regional Development Act has failed to spark an economic renaissance in the region, despite billions of dollars in federal investment.

The decline of coal mining is also being driven by cheaper natural gas and competing reserves. Utilities are retiring plants or converting them to burn other fuels, citing these factors as major contributors to the closures.

Efforts to protect the environment and public health are underway, including opposition to Senate Bill 1751, which would stop guidelines for protecting water from arsenic and other pollutants found in coal ash waste. The Appalachian Regional Commission has spent $27 billion on infrastructure projects since 1965, but these efforts have largely failed to stimulate economic growth.

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the summary, and the article's claims about market movements and indicators are supported by the summary's information on forward-looking options traders and market-based measures of investor expectations. The only discrepancy is the mention of a ""flash crash"" on Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google in the article, which is not mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. However, this does not significantly impact my confidence in the classification, as it appears to be an anecdotal example rather than a comprehensive market prediction.","Market analysis articles discuss various market trends, indicators, and potential future movements. Key points include:

* Market is experiencing a sideways chop range with potential support at 2405-2415.
* Bitcoin and blockchain searches exceed Trump's, indicating a strong rally in the sector.
* The Nasdaq 100 has had a surprisingly strong bounce but is in an intermediate-term down trend.
* Market breadth indicators suggest the rally is running out of fuel, with decreasing new highs and increasing percentage of stocks trading above the 200-day moving average.
* A ""head and shoulders"" pattern was observed, but Yellen's speech may influence market direction.
* Distribution has finally shown up, indicating a weakening market, but the September high is more likely to hold.
* Equity futures are expected to open above day-session-only R1 at 1184.00, with a close above 1198.00 allowing continuation of the bullish trend.

These articles focus on technical analysis, market trends, and potential future movements, providing insights into the current state of the markets.","Market trends and news:

US stocks rose on election eve, with the Dow up 1.91% and the S&P 500 up 2.01%. The gains were broad-based, with all 30 Dow components rising. The FBI cleared Hillary Clinton of criminal charges related to her email server.

Investors are less optimistic about market movements ahead of the US presidential election. Forward-looking options traders expect a 2.4% move in the S&P 500 between Monday and Friday.

The Fed's timetable is uncertain, with some analysts seeing confirmation that no rate hike is likely until December. Market-based measures of investor expectations put the odds of a September rate increase at just 24%.

Earnings recovery is expected, with improving profits buoyed by rising employment and business spending. The Australian dollar and Brazilian real are showing signs of strength in 2016.

Tech shares stumbled after an early rally, with investors focusing on retail and consumer products sectors instead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended trading up 47.74 points, or 0.5%, to close the day.

Investors are cautious about the coming year, with some executives expressing caution about growth.

es morning update june 6th 2017 (before it's news) the es futures finally sold off a little afterhours and premarket this morning. and they went right to the green rising trendline and pierced it slightly it appears. as we know the big support is down in the multi-day sideways chop zone of 2405-2415, but i doubt if it gets that low as it’s an obvious target and that’s not something the market likes to give to everyone. i’m thinking they will turn it back up shortly after the open and well go again into a sideways chop range from yesterday’s high to this mornings low. when i look again at the macd on this 60 minute chart you can see that it fell through the zero level and didn’t make the usual turn back up. this is most likely due to the 6 hour chart having its’ macd crossing over in the +5 to +6 area and putting some downward pressure on the market. looking at it i think it will take a few days to get oversold, with one of those days being today. so, by tomorrow or thursday at the latest it should be oversold enough to turn back up and support the 60 minute chart when it aligns bullish again. now while all that sounds bearish for the market it’s really just “not bullish” as price can chop sideways in a trading range for several days easily while the charts reset back to bullish. meaning i wouldn

headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! after today, i am going to assume that ibd will have us still in correction, since we didn’t have sufficient gain for a follow through day. that would be a wise move on their part, as, unless something changes, it is looking unlikely we will be going up much farther. while volume looks ok, we are starting to churn, and i believe that a lot of profit taking is going on. a failure to get to a new high here will pretty much seal us into a spring correction, and that should begin quite soon. having said all that, we still had a positive day today, and the rally is not yet dead. the nasdaq 100 has had a surprisingly strong bounce, and has come right back up to resistance, where it pulled back from today. with the gap, we did get enough gain here for a follow through day, but this is not one of the indexes that ibd tracks for that. this has been relatively strong of late, which gives the bulls some hope for a new rally, but the retest of resistance is giving the bears a very tempting shorting point. well this is trouble. the russell 2000, even with a strong bounce, is in an intermediate term down trend, and is going to have trouble getting out of it. it is quite extended now and probably won;t go much higher without a pullback first. we do, though, have

Article 3 - market breadth worries
source: short side of long while the s&p 500 has been making all time new highs in recent months, the internals of the stock market index suggest a different picture. the chart above shows that the nyse number of stocks making new highs decreasing at every new marginal high the market made, indicating that the rally is running out of fuel. similar occurrence were seen at the 2007 and 2011 tops. chart 2: s&p 500 together with percentage of stocks trading above 200 ma source: short side of long one of my favourite indicators to follow is the percentage of stocks trading above the 200 day moving average, as seen in the chart above. this indicator is useful to track bullish and bearish divergences, as certain stocks will turn in opposite direction to the overall market and be a major “tell tell”. furthermore, this indicator is also useful on nominal basis too, as it tells us whether the stock market is overbought or oversold. as a general rule above 80% is overbought and below 20% is oversold, but markets do spend a lot more time in overbought range (as the rally is a prolonged process), so this is where non-confirming divergence becomes a leading indication that all is not well. and, as the chart shows, we have a major one right now, so it is time to pay attention. chart 3: s&p 500 together with the nyse advance decline line

Article 4 - es morning update june 6th 2016
es morning update june 6th 2016 (before it's news) looks like a “head and shoulders” pattern but with yellen speaking today i would bet on any patterns playing out correctly. macd’s pointing up on this 60 minute chart and several other time frames as well. not much to say this morning as everyone is waiting on janet yellen to speak. since the job data last friday was so bad i’d say most traders are expecting the fed’s to not raise the interest rates because the economy isn’t recovering. the pre-market being up this morning before the open clearly shows that some traders are front running the meeting as they are expecting a rally from the “no interest rate hike” announcement. of course if they are wrong they will get caught with their pants down on that trade. i don’t see anything clear in the charts right now to point the next big direction. we are overbought, but a squeeze seems likely now that there’s the chance of them not raising rates. it’s a tough call her guys but it “feels” like there are still too many bears on board and they plan to squeeze them out before the next drop. sometimes i just have to go with a “feeling” as opposed to charts and today feels like a very, very tricky day. today is 06/06/16, which has three 6′s in it, or 666… which when you add in the fact that yellen

Article 5 - distribution, finally
(before it's news) distribution has finally shown up, but so far it is only one day, so it s not time to panic yet. we are not even close to the 50dma, and the 20dema looks like it could provide a bunce here. the september high is now more likely to hold, although with 3 days nleft in the quarter, it is likely we wil get some buying as window dressing. however, the technical indicators show us the market is weakening, and with macd now crossing over, we appear to be entering a time of downward momentum. how strong it is and how long it lasts is unknown. i would not be surprised to see a test of the 5odma, but i would be surprised to see it this week. whoever triggered thee flash crash in oil last week might have known something: it was no flash in the pan, but the start of another down move. we now no longer have moving averages as support: instead, they are now resistance again. it seems likely to me that we are headed for a test of support at 88. gold is hanging tight, although macd is now moving down. tha does not necessarily mean a big move down, but a move down is likely. the yield on the 10 year is also moving down, but nowhere near the previous low, which should be support. there is a chance it will find support here: if so, look for a sudden reversal up in the

trading markets? your must-read morning cheat sheet 11.24.10 (before it's news) this story from wall street cheat sheet the exclusive markets morning report is supplied by the precision report. the precise take – equity futures up ahead of us holiday big picture analysis: the bears’ window of opportunity is shrinking, as seasonality favors the bulls again this afternoon, and especially so on friday. despite the barrage of negative headlines, last week’s lows in the es held, and traders have bid up equity futures on a favorable jobless claims report this morning (despite a below consensus durable goods report). a close above 1198.00 today would allow continuation that builds momentum into next week. a close below 1171.00 leaves the window open for the bears. with international headlines in the forefront, it’s also important to recall last year’s dubai 30 point shakeout. only a close below 1157.00 casts serious doubt about the bulls regaining the upper hand. trading today: with the es poised to open above day-session-only r1 at 1184.00, we’ll be on alert for a trend day up if it holds in the first 30 minutes (opposite to yesterday’s open below s1). if it breaks, there should be a test of the daily gap/pivot area of 1178.25 to 1179.25. when the gaps and pivots are in tight confluence, they act as a

how the mayan calendar, david wilcock and ben fulford have made me conclude that the worst stock market crash in history is just weeks away! (before it's news) the good guys, the aliens, and the bad guys all know that the stock market and the economy must crash! first, the good guys have been busy shutting down more underground bases as this latest update from david wilcock (commenting on ben fulford’s post) states… comments by david i can confirm from my own contacts that very few, if any lives were lost in the destruction of the underground bases. ben is right. this is another good proof that we’re both hearing the same things. apparently for 24 hours before there was an explosion in either case, audio recordings that have now been recovered from the bases have the sounds of massive amounts of furniture sliding across the floor and people yelling. it appears that portals were opened up in the bases and they just pulled everything out — personnel, equipment and everything in between. there is no “stuff” left in what remains. all the supplies are gone. however, where my sources disagree with ben is that they are saying there is no radioactivity. nukes were not used. instead, it was a 20-fold spontaneous increase in air pressure, after everything had been pulled out for this 24-hour period. many of the personnel working in these bases were brought in during the 1970s, and are forbidden to ever walk the surface of the earth

Article 1 - after gaining for 3 days, shares slip on oil worries
stocks on wall street edged lower tuesday, reversing three consecutive trading days of advances amid concerns over oil prices and japan’s nuclear crisis. the insurrection in libya and the problems at the damaged nuclear reactors in japan have heightened the sense of uncertainty about oil prices. on tuesday, a report of a surge in inflation in britain added to expectations of higher rates in europe. but as the three main indexes remained generally lower or flat, analysts said there was little impetus to drive the markets beyond the usual risk and uncertainty that investors have become accustomed to lately. “we have seen a couple of very strong days, and it is not surprising it is a flat day as investors reconsider the bounceback we have seen,” said kate warne, an investment strategist for edward jones. advertisement continue reading the main story “we are getting a very event-driven market,” she added. “it is a catch-your-breath, or wait-and-see day without a lot of market moving news.”

Article 2 - weighing the week ahead: possible stimulus and how to pay | investing.com
it is a short week without much new data. even fedspeak is on holiday. the big story will continue to be the trump transition. i expect the punditry to be asking a dual question: how much economic stimulus and how to pay? last week once again, last week’s economic news was nearly all good, but not the focus of discussion. theme recap in my last wtwa, i predicted that it would be “all trump, all of the time”. and so it was. speculation about the effect of trump policies is rampant, usually wrong, and revised daily. this is profitable for media sources and the punditry, so we can expect it to continue. the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart from doug short . he captures the continuing rally as well as the late-week weakness (despite options expiration). spx chart doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information. his charts save more than a thousand words! read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long-term perspective. the news each week i break down events into good and bad. often there is an “ugly” and on rare occasion something very positive. my working definition of “good” has two components. the news must be market friendly and better than expectations. i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news – and you should, too! this week’s news was quite

Title: es morning update july 5th 2017
Content: es morning update july 5th 2017 (before it's news) i hope everyone had a great 4th of july. now it’s back to business. there’s an fomc meeting today but it’s just the minutes from the prior meeting. still though, many traders put off trades until it’s over with as they think something new might be said. so we could have a slow morning while we wait for that 2pm est period to arrive. chartwise we are trapped in a falling channel of sorts. resistance is right above from the green rising trendline and the black falling trendline. the macd’s are making lower highs on each rally attempt and are just a hair above the zero line right now, but look weak like they could rollover anytime. logically it’s more likely to rollover before the meeting as the “unknown” scares traders. however, there’s still another light volume day expected and most bearish setups don’t play out from what i’ve noticed. so i’d be more into believing that we’ll just trend sideways to up with small pullback bought. after the meeting and nothing changes the charts should be back to normal. what is normal these days though? normal is whatever the fed’s want the market to do i guess. and that’s “go up” 99% of the time in my opinion. then once in a blue moon they flash crash it. speaking of flash crashes they a big one yesterday on amazon, apple, microsoft and google (article is re-posted on my blog). a friend told me the qqq’s actually showed a print of 67 on them too! talk about a crash, now that’s a crash. of course they just call this a “data glitch” but we “red pill takers” know there’s a code in those numbers for the future price of those stocks and the nasdaq, which means a crash is coming at some point… but the “when” part is unknown. anyway, back to the market for today and the rest of this week. i’m expecting more light volume, which suggests more upside then downside. there’s an “inverted head and shoulders” pattern there too, which is bullish of course. and when you add in the new rising trendline in reddish pink you’ll see we are also in a triangle… and near the apex where breakouts or breakdowns happen. so if the fed’s don’t say anything bad i have to side with the bulls and expect another run higher versus a breakdown to retest the 6/29 lows. but i still think the bulls are running out of time and a top this month is likely. august through october are bear months and with these new fp’s put out yesterday there’s certainly a coded message of something bad yet to come. source: http://reddragonleo.com/2017/07/05/es-morning-update-july-5th-2017/

the two faces of rim: how do you read it? (before it's news) research in motion (rimm) is no stranger to volatility following its quarterly earnings reports, and thursday morning was no exception with the stock trading off more than 5%. on wednesday evening, the blackberry maker released results that were slightly weaker than analysts’ estimates and showed a further decline in average selling price per unit to $$311. earnings per share came in at $$1.27 which was 27% higher than a year ago yet still trailed estimates by a penny. revenue growth of 18% to $$4.1 billion also missed expectations by a fairly significant margin, as shipments of about 10.5 million units fell half a million shy of analysts’ projections. the company’s co-ceo jim balsillie admits that the smart phone market competition continues to be stiff, but they are pleased with their market share leading position adding another 4.9 million subscribers in the quarter. while there were some disappointments in the previous quarter, the company also issued guidance for the current quarter that was above wall street’s view. for the first quarter of 2011 rim expects sales of $$4.25 to $$4.45 billion and gross margin slipping to 45.7%. this expectation translates into eps of $$1.31 to $$1.38 on net subscriber gains of 4.9 to 5.2 million. analysts were anticipating $$1.23 per

campbell soup posted a decline in quarterly profit on friday and lowered its outlook for the year, citing disappointing soup sales. campbell, the world’s largest soup maker, said aggressive promotions on canned soup failed to increase sales as much as planned. the disappointing results were partly a result of deep discounting by a rival brand, progresso, which is owned by general mills and posted a 30 percent increase in sales volume. campbell said it earned $239 million, or 71 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $259 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. sales in the period, which ended jan. 30 and was the second quarter of campbell’s fiscal year, fell to $2.13 billion from $2.15 billion. advertisement continue reading the main story profit matched wall street analysts’ forecasts while sales fell short. stock in the company, which is based in camden, n.j., fell $1.36, to $33.58 a share. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. campbell said it expects 2011 earnings per share to decline

Article 6 - new siemens chief sees weakness in china
“given germany’s higher dependence on the emerging markets in recent years,” ralph solveen, an economist at commerzbank, said in a note to clients, “much lower growth of the economy there would have a marked impact on germany and could push the long-awaited upswing further into the future.” the appointment of mr. kaeser, 56, is a return to the siemens’s tradition of naming insiders to head the company. he promised to restore the company’s reputation for reliability and top-flight engineering, which has suffered recently because of a number of well-publicized fiascos. siemens has been late to deliver high-speed trains for the german railroad and had problems connecting a huge offshore wind generation project to the power grid. those problems contributed to a profit warning last week, and a decline in sales and operating profit that siemens reported on wednesday. those problems led to mr. löscher’s departure. mr. löscher, 55, who had previously worked in top management at the american drug maker merck and at general electric, was brought aboard in 2007 to lead the company, one of germany’s largest employers, during a corruption scandal. the appointment of an outsider made sense at time when many existing siemens managers were under a cloud, said christian stadler, an associate professor at warwick business school in coventry, england, who has studied siemens. but over the long run it is difficult for an outsider lacking

Article 1 - on the road to world war iii
on the road to world war iii (before it's news) the new world order is a diabolical plan developed by the financial elite as a way to ruin the national sovereignty of the governments of the world through economic blackmail and world conflict with the objective of enslaving humankind in a one world fascist dictatorship / government. the agents of the new world order have effectively obtained control of the world’s financial system. our politicians have made it “legal” for the private banking corporations to manipulate our money supply, stock market and inevitably our destiny. a famous quote “money is the root of all evil” is fitting, but a greater understanding comes when you ask the question “what is the root of all money?”. the private banking corporations manipulate the printing press and print money for the price of paper (usury) and utilize it to enslave the nations and people of the world in financial debt. our governments have become completely insolvent or bankrupt through the construction of this financial debt slavery. our governments are now maxing out the nwo credit line to keep the game going. we, the people are the only resources keeping the system alive as we are deceitfully sold into slavery at birth to the financial market as property of the state. our productive power or labor via the income tax is utilized as equity for this debt slavery. matrix-esque anyone? given that the agents of the nwo manipulate the economy, our governments are slaves to the economic structure. the nwo utilizes this power to control

Article 2 - how the financial class robs from the american people legally.
as tax day passes us by, many in the public are realizing that the extremely wealthy especially in the financial industry know something they don’t. what they are finding is that the financial industry has access to massive government bailouts and in many cases does not pay their fair share of taxes. like atlas holding the world up some are carrying a heavier burden and it doesn’t appear to be the financial sector. reports out from the secretive federal reserve show for example a $$220 million loan to the wives of wall street executives merely for speculative purposes. a win-win gift from our central bank as a thank you for leading the nation into this economic ditch. do you have access to cheap and plentiful loans? there is also this absurd notion that people don’t pay taxes and much of the ire has been on the poor. when you hear this in the media, they mean federal income tax. people need to take account of their lives and figure that they pay for social security tax, medicare tax, sales tax, property tax, and automotive registration fees so this idea that average americans don’t pay tax is a complete misnomer. in fact, it seems like the extremely wealthy in this country have designed a tax system that has shifted the burden to the majority. the media narrative revolves around the fact that you should shoulder the brunt of the economic problems caused by the financial industry while bailouts and handouts increase the bottom line at the top. the income inequality in our nation has never been so high.

Article 7 - the federal reserve system, a christmas gift that keeps on taking
the federal reserve system, a christmas gift that keeps on taking (before it's news) ninety nine years ago this month, the law that brought the federal reserve system into existence was passed. it did so at the behest of some very wealthy and very greedy men who wanted nothing less than total control of as much of the world’s total wealth that they could possibly get their hands on. these men with names like aldrich, rockefeller, rothschild, vanderlip, kuhn, loeb, warburg, morgan, schiff, et al. wanted nothing less than total control of finances, currencies and economies worldwide. they wanted it so badly that they cared not what the majority might think, and they certainly didn’t care what the common folk at the time might think. these were the robber barons of finance in their day, and they knew the general public wouldn’t trust them or their banking schemes. it was for this reason they had to remain secretive in their plans and use every deception and political dirty trick in their arsenal to achieve their goals. it took three years to set things up, but just before christmas, on the 23rd of december in the year 1913, the federal reserve act was enacted. it was sold to the american people as a sort of present to them, a way to stabilize the economy and prevent boom and bust cycles. what it was in actuality was a present to the wealthiest amongst us, the central bankers, and

Article 8 - the descent into stasis
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! last weeks’ post attempted, with the help of the ancient greek philosopher polybius, to trace out the trajectory that democracies—and in particular the united states—tend to follow across time. the pattern that polybius outlined, and that american politics has cycled through three times so far in the course of its history, begins with most of the nation’s political power concentrated in a single person, and follows the diffusion of power to the point that the entire political system settles into a gridlock only a massive crisis can break. just now, according to that model, we are in the stage of gridlock, and thus of maximum diffusion of power. now of course this interpretation flies in the face of the standard narrative that surrounds power in america today. both sides of the political spectrum these days like to insist that too much power is in the hands of the other side, at least when the other side is in the white house or has a majority in congress. the further from the mainstream you go, the more strident the voices you’ll hear insisting that some small group or other has seized absolute power over the us political system and is running things for their own advantage. the identity of the small group in question varies wildly—it’s hard to think of anyone who hasn’t been accused, at some point in the last half century or so, of being the secret elite that runs everything—but the theory that some small

Article 1 - can poor people be taught to save?
photo why can’t poor people save money? the answer might appear blindingly obvious: they don’t earn enough. but that explanation didn’t satisfy stephen brobeck — it was too easy, too defeatist. as the executive director of the consumer federation of america for nearly three decades, he has watched people increase debt and decrease savings. the trend disturbs him. while brobeck thinks that everyone should save more, he is particularly concerned about the poorest americans. about nine million households have effectively no financial assets — nothing to fall back on for emergencies or retirement. and it was with them in mind that brobeck embarked on a social experiment to change people’s savings habits. to get people to save, however, brobeck first needed to know why they didn’t. so the c.f.a. enlisted john caskey, a professor of economics at swarthmore college, who arranged for anthropologists to conduct in-depth interviews in two low-income communities, one in urban san jose, calif., and one in rural mississippi. “i had expected people would talk about the cost of not having a bank account or having a bad credit history,” caskey said. “i thought they’d talk about financial inconvenience, but they instead talked about the stress.” in many cases, people didn’t save not because they actually couldn’t, caskey discovered, but because they believed they couldn’t. part of that psychological barrier, caskey found, was social pressure to not save; the minute

Article 3 - a cashless economy in zimbabwe? with little cash, there’s little choice
the change has been revolutionary for what was a mostly cash economy until early this year. it has helped ease the cash crisis, which paralyzed business a few months ago. in a fragile economy reeling from a global collapse in commodity prices, a historic drought and lack of investor confidence, the spread of plastic is the one bright spot. “we had to migrate to electronic platforms as a matter of necessity, rather than as a matter of choice,” said clive mphambela, an advocacy and marketing executive at the bankers association of zimbabwe. “zimbabwe is unique in many, many respects, and this is just one of them.” the cash crunch remains so severe that the government started a media campaign this week to publicize the imminent introduction of so-called bond notes, paper notes that it says will be backed by the african export-import bank and will be interchangeable with the american dollar. but most zimbabweans already view the notes with deep distrust, suspecting a government ploy to reintroduce a local currency. “i wish i could withdraw my money just at once than to keep visiting the bank every day, and i pray i could do this before bond notes are distributed,” said precious makaza, 28, a schoolteacher who was standing in a long line in front of zb bank on robert mugabe road. in rural areas, where there is no electricity or cellphone coverage, there is so little cash that residents are returning to a fallback they have used plenty of times: bartering.

Article 4 - dangers of too much comfort
change can be a scary thing. so it's no wonder that we're drawn to things we recognize -- to things that are familiar -- and stick with them. it's why we go to a chain restaurant, buy clothes from the gap and drive the same kind of car for big chunks of our lives. it's human to look for the familiar and to keep coming back. but when it comes to investing and money, this pattern creates some problematic biases. let's take a look at how they might be impacting your life. 1. paying every month each month there are certain bills that we get in the habit of paying without really thinking about them. some, like our utilities and mortgage, are a given. but what about that gym membership? we're even more oblivious to the bills that get paid automatically. over time, we can end up spending more money than we'd like on things we don't really want and maybe aren't even using. but we do it because we always have, and we haven't stopped to ask why. a new month starts on tuesday. i suggest you sit down and make a list of all your monthly bills. then go through each one and ask the question: do i really need this? 2. believing in the company secretaries becoming millionaires because they own a bunch of company stock are the exception, not the norm. so don't kid yourself that working for a company, having a 401(k) with that company and investing the rest

Article 5 - even in recession, spend they must: luxury shoppers anonymous
“people are saying: ‘it’s that time of year; i want to buy something, but i feel a little weird,’ ” ms. goldberg said. “often they tell me, ‘i don’t want to be out there making an announcement with a big bag that says harry winston.’ ” private dealers, many of them dilettantes who acquire their wares from designer friends, at trade shows and from dealers and artisans in exotic locales, are the bane of recession-battered high-end merchants. established retailers are hard pressed to compete with such luxury pop-up shops while maintaining inventories and absorbing the high costs of operating their businesses. but under-the-radar parties offer the well heeled, and the well connected, a chance to snap up temptations without an inner censor chiding them for their spendthrift ways. photo “there is certainly a stigma to spending openly in this economy,” said eric spangenberg, a consumer psychologist and the dean of the business school at washington state university. “these people don’t want to appear flippant by disregarding the woes of the economy,” he said, “but they still want to get their shop on, and they’re going to find a way.” those who cannot wean themselves off the shopping habit flock to events that are, in dr. spangenberg’s phrase, “the high-end equivalent of a tupperware party.” there they trade gossip and air kisses — and spring for crewelwork

Article 6 - how giving became cool
turner’s gift helped change that culture, reviving the tradition of great philanthropists like rockefeller and carnegie. turner publicly began needling other billionaires — including bill gates and warren buffett — to be more generous. that was a breach of etiquette, but it worked. “it’s a starting point for me of this modern era of high-profile big public giving,” reflected matthew bishop, co-author of “philanthrocapitalism,” a terrific book about how the business world is reshaping philanthropy. “he called on others to step up, which did have a crystallizing effect on others. it allowed journalists and others who were talking to bill gates to say: ‘why aren’t you giving more?’ ” then they tormented buffett with the same question. ultimately, gates and buffett made huge contributions that are transforming the struggle against global disease and poverty. my hunch is that gates will be remembered less for his work on personal computers than for his accomplishments against malaria , aids and poverty itself. photo gates and buffett are both now recruiters for the giving pledge, which commits zillionaires to give away at least half their wealth. the giving pledge adds to the expectation that those who have won the global jackpot should give something back. turner channeled his money through the united nations foundation, where it was leveraged to get other contributions so as to bring $2 billion to finance causes from malaria to polio , from climate change to family

Article 7 - net worth, self-worth and how we look at money
those who are in the money avoidance camp share beliefs that make them distance themselves from money. mr. klontz said this group may be worried about abusing credit cards. they may believe that they do not deserve to have money and may sabotage their own financial well-being. people in this group tend to have low incomes and net worth. they also tend to be younger. people who fall into the money worship camp would seem to be the opposite, but their behaviors are equally destructive. they believe that an increase in income or a windfall will make everything better and love the status derived from the things that money can buy. this belief also lands people in debt because they use whatever credit they have to buy things that will impress others. “they believe money will solve all of your problems,” mr. klontz said. “this is the money belief pattern that afflicts the majority of americans.” anxiety about money status occurs when people’s self-worth is linked to their net worth. these people often take bigger financial risks because they want to have the stories of big gains to impress their friends. (don’t expect them to tell you when those big bets do not pay off.) the only affliction that did not have an overwhelmingly negative impact on people’s financial future was money vigilance. people with this disorder do not like to share information about their income or wealth, but they also do not spend foolishly. still, excessive wariness about spending can keep these people from enjoying the benefits of

Article 8 - out from india’s alleys, gold loans gain respect
most indians, especially those working in the informal economy, which accounts for 92 percent of the country’s 400 million workers, have few choices when they need to borrow money: they lack other collateral or have no documents to prove their incomes. gold loan firms have also benefited from the financial crisis. in the last year and a half, many lenders have stopped making unsecured personal loans here because of rising defaults in india. photo it is now “a lot more palatable for banks to give loans against gold jewelry,” said viren h. mehta, a national director at ernst & young india. as a result, for borrowers like vishwanathan c. r. pai, a rickshaw repairman, gold loans are an essential financial tool. he frequently hands over his family’s jewelry at muthoot finance to pay operating expenses for his business. he often borrows 10,000 to 25,000 rupees ($200 to $500) to buy spare parts, repaying the loans when customers pay him. he pays 15 to 18 percent interest. mr. pai said he couldn’t get a business loan from banks because they wanted documentation of his income. but his customers, who earn as little as $100 a month, don’t do checks and invoices. “it is very easy here, there are no formalities,” mr. pai, 29, said about borrowing at muthoot. as recently as a decade ago, people like

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
A social experiment by the Consumer Federation of America aimed to change people's savings habits, particularly among the poorest Americans. The study found that many people didn't save due to psychological barriers, such as social pressure and stress, rather than a lack of financial ability.

In the mining industry, Rio Tinto agreed to sell its Alcan Aluminium UK business for $410 million to two members of Energy & Metals Group GFG Alliance. This sale is part of a wave of asset sales across the industry, with Rio Tinto having announced over $1.3 billion in divestments this year.

In Zimbabwe, the spread of plastic has helped ease the cash crisis, which paralyzed business earlier this year. The government introduced electronic platforms as a matter of necessity, and some residents are returning to bartering due to lack of cash.

Research on investing and money habits found that people often stick to familiar patterns, such as buying from chain restaurants or driving the same car for long periods. This can lead to problematic biases, including overspending on unnecessary items.

High-end shoppers during a recession often find ways to spend without appearing conspicuous, using events like private dealers' parties to make purchases. Consumer psychologists note that this behavior is driven by a desire to maintain social status and impress others.

Philanthropists like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have been encouraged to be more generous by high-profile donors, leading to increased giving and contributions to causes such as global disease and poverty.

Research on money attitudes found that people who avoid money

(before it's news) new american round of sanctions is enhanced by the european council’s decision to impose restrictive measure against moscow. the leaders of the european union agreed today to suspend financial cooperation with russia. this action imposes restrictions on the european investment bank (eib) and european bank for reconstruction and development (ebrd), to cooperate with moscow due to what the europeans understand as russia’s incoherent performance in the ukrainian crisis. heads of state and government also decided to expand a community-wide legal basis for its sanctions to reach a larger range of entities that threaten the integrity of ukraine, diplomatic sources explained. the twenty-eight members made ​​these decisions during an extraordinary summit dedicated to nominate candidates for the top positions of the institutions of the eu, which also deals with international issues. the european council in its conclusions regretted that the requirements it demanded from russia had not been met, even though according to its members, they could have helped difuse tensions with ukraine. therefore, they agreed to “expand the restrictive measures directed against institutions, including the russian federation, in ways that affect the country materially and financially. the eu now considers russia’s behavior as actions that undermine and threaten the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of ukraine. eu members urged the foreign ministers of the union, which will meet in brussels on tuesday, to prepare the legal documents required for this purpose, so that the measure is effective. the meeting also agreed to

flynn’s out: is ‘the new détente’ really dead – or can russia still benefit? (before it's news) andrew korybko 21st century wire the global media is awash with analysis and speculation about the resignation of former national security advisor michael flynn, with everyone trying to make sense of what happened, why it occurred, and what it means for the future of the trump presidency and us-russian relations more broadly. flynn didn’t resign because he broke any laws; he left the white house supposedly because of the erosion of trust between him and the president which occurred as a result of this “deep state”-driven fake scandal. neoconservative and obama/clinton-aligned elements of the us’ permanent military, intelligence, and diplomatic bureaucracies conspired to get rid of one of trump’s most trusted and promising advisors in order to preemptively undermine his hoped-for new détente with russia in the new cold war. flynn was an integral part of this initiative and therefore had to be taken out as soon as possible, since his political assassination could change the momentum of the us’ “deep state” civil war and improve the odds that other revolutionary thought leaders such as stephen bannon and stephen miller – could be the next to go. retracing the sequence of events the grand objective is to neutralize trump’s capacity to “drain the swamp” (even if only partially as it relates to us-r

fascist atrocities mount as us-backed regime assaults eastern ukraine headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! alex lantier as the western-backed regime in kiev assaults pro-russian militias in the major cities of eastern ukraine, mass graves are coming to light in slavyansk, the former opposition stronghold recently captured by kiev. the government offensive is unfolding with the support of washington and the european union (eu), which yesterday imposed more sanctions to compel moscow to abandon any support for opposition militias in ukraine. andriy lysenko, the spokesman for the kiev regime’s defense and security council, said yesterday that “hundreds of bodies of rebel fighters” had been found in shallow graves. lysenko claimed some of the graves “have been mined by the terrorists”—apparently implying that some of the dead were killed during the siege of slavyansk and buried by fellow opposition fighters before kiev’s forces captured the town. lysenko refused to give further details. while the kiev regime’s bombardment of slavyansk doubtless caused hundreds of casualties, its own accounts show that the far-right ukrainian nationalist militias it has mobilized are carrying out a campaign of political terror and murder in slavyansk. upon capturing the city, they detained all men between the ages of 25 and 35 on suspicion of supporting or giving aid, including medical aid, to the opposition militias. on tuesday, interior ministry official anton

pcr – ukraine “more dangerous than cuban missile crisis” (before it's news) from king world news today former us treasury official, dr. paul craig roberts, warned king world news that despite western mainstream propaganda, the situation in ukraine is now more dangerous than the cuban missile crisis. this is another one of dr. roberts’ most important interviews in history because for the second time he is openly warning washington to stop its aggressive actions against the russians in their own backyard. below is what dr. roberts had to say in this remarkable interview. eric king: “we now have the western mainstream media propaganda machine trying to convince people that everything is fine in ukraine. they have stocks soaring today and there is pressure on gold as part of the show. propaganda aside, what is really happening with the situation in ukraine and crimea, dr. roberts?” dr. roberts: “it could be that washington comes to its senses. on the other hand, it’s embarrassed. washington has lost control and it looks as though the southern and eastern provinces are demanding to go back to ‘mother russia.’ this isn’t something the russians have fomented — it’s the people there. so there is a great danger here because to the threats that u.s. secretary of state john kerry made to russia, the russian foreign minister replied, ‘these are unacceptable.’…. continue reading at kingworldnews.com… source:

Article 1 - no easy way out of ukraine crisis
while secretary of state john kerry visited kiev on tuesday to show support for its beleaguered pro-western government, mr. obama consulted with chancellor angela merkel of germany by telephone about finding a face-saving way for mr. putin to withdraw in favor of international monitors. speaking with reporters, mr. obama said some had interpreted mr. putin’s remarks earlier in the day to mean he “is pausing for a moment and reflecting on what’s happened.” others cautioned against reading too much into mr. putin’s statements. “it would be a mistake on our part to look at what he’s saying and think this crisis is almost over: ‘o.k., we’ve lost crimea, but the rest of the country is with us,’ ” said ivo daalder, mr. obama’s first ambassador to nato and now president of the chicago council on global affairs. he said crimea would become a precedent: “crimea is a big deal. it means a country can be invaded, and a big piece of it can be taken away with no price. but two, this isn’t just about crimea. this is about who is ultimately in control of ukraine.” the situation remained tense, as obama administration officials moved forward with plans for sanctions that could be imposed by the united states and, they hoped, in conjunction with european allies. the administration is developing plans for actions that would escalate over time if russia continued

Article 2 - world is about to find out what trump really believes
world is about to find out what trump really believes the new york times 1 hr ago by david e. sanger, maggie haberman and binyamin appelbaum © damon winter/the new york times donald j. trump on election night. he faces some of the biggest quandaries on security, and sees little long-term benefit from funding efforts to eliminate the root causes of terrorism, preferring military solutions. washington — in donald j. trump’s private conversations and public commentary, one guiding principle shines through: the world is a zero-sum place, and nations, like real estate developers, are either on the winning side of a deal or the losing side. yet he also is the ultimate pragmatist, perfectly willing to dispense with seemingly core beliefs in return for negotiating advantage. that is why many of his closest supporters have long cautioned that the most headline-grabbing proposals of his run for the presidency should not be taken literally — they are guideposts, the supporters suggest, not plans. even mr. trump once described his proposed ban on muslim immigrants as a mere “suggestion.” as he enters the oval office that ronald reagan — another populist pragmatist, but one who had served in public office before the white house — left nearly 28 years ago, the world is about to find out what donald trump really believes. or at least what he is going to try to do, in partnership with republicans who on tuesday retained control of both houses

Article 3 - pentagon and state department said to propose arming ukraine
photo washington — the pentagon and state department have proposed to the white house a plan to supply ukraine with anti-tank missiles and other arms, according to defense department officials. the proposed transfer — which also would include antiaircraft arms that would be defined as defensive weaponry — comes as fighting between ukrainian troops and russian-backed separatists has increased in recent days, and the united states is taking steps to deter aggressive military actions by moscow. the plan by the pentagon and state department has been presented to the white house, but no decision has been made, said a defense department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a proposal still under review. it was not clear if president trump had been briefed on the proposal. whether to provide more substantial weaponry to kiev’s beleaguered forces has embroiled american policy makers for several years. advertisement continue reading the main story two years ago, eight former senior american officials urged the obama administration to send $3 billion in defensive arms and equipment to ukraine, including anti-armor missiles, reconnaissance drones, armored humvees and radars that can determine the location of enemy rocket and artillery fire.

Article 4 - ukrainian opposition leader to be freed soon, daughter says
on wednesday, an adviser to president toomas hendrik ilves of estonia told the interfax news agency that the president canceled a scheduled meeting with ukraine’s foreign minister, who was visiting the estonian capital, “due to changes in the president’s schedule.” he went on to call ukraine’s drift from democratic practices “a great loss for the whole of europe.” the prospect of international isolation has put ukraine’s president, viktor f. yanukovich, in an extraordinarily difficult spot. western pressure has produced a deadline of sorts — on oct. 20, mr. yanukovich is set to attend a long-planned meeting in brussels, and some european union officials have suggested that they may refuse to receive him there. a spokesman for ukraine’s foreign ministry was cagey about the date on wednesday, saying it has never been officially announced, “so how can we talk about its cancellation?” photo a narrow loophole will appear two days earlier, on oct. 18, when the ukrainian parliament convenes to discuss a draft measure that might decriminalize the law under which ms. tymoshenko was prosecuted. an opposition lawmaker, arseniy yatseniuk, said wednesday that the president could sign the proposal into law the same day, so that “the authorities will face minimal losses in this situation.” on wednesday, ms. carr said she expected her mother to be free very soon. “all the signals indicate that

Article 5 - eu set to extend russia sanctions, but may be harder when trump president
* eu, u.s. imposed sanctions in 2014 * trump wants better ties with putin * as president, trump may change u.s. policy * rapprochement with russia may not be easy brussels, nov 10 (reuters) - the european union is likely to extend economic sanctions on russia over ukraine in december but could find it much harder to renew them in the future if donald trump succeeds in warming up relations with russia. trump, who will take over as u.s. president in january, has said he wants a ""good relationship"" with russia and president vladimir putin, alarming some in the eu who fear a policy shift that softens the u.s. stance on the ukraine crisis. the sanctions were first imposed shortly after russia annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014 and rolled over for six-month periods since then. five european diplomats told reuters they expected eu leaders to extend the main economic sanctions in brussels next month -- before trump takes office. the decision requires unanimity among the 28 member states and the economic sanctions are now in place until the late january, 2017. ""the roll-over in december should still happen. there is no change on the ground in ukraine ... there is really no argument not to extend them,"" said a european diplomat.

Article 6 - many at u.n. seek evidence for u.s. case against iraq
in the background is the bush administration's policy of ''regime change.'' the notion is anathema to many at the united nations, who see it as smacking of the american arrogance of the cold war, when washington sponsored coups to unseat governments it did not like. respect for the sovereignty of other nations, even the less savory ones, is a core operating principle of the world organization. the administration policy ''collides with the role of the united nations,'' said a senior diplomat from a security council member that could be an important swing vote. but he added that he was open to hearing mr. bush's arguments. ''the united states does not have a weak case,'' the diplomat said. ''but the united states first has to prove its case, that iraq has weapons of mass destruction and the intention to use them in an imminent attack.'' the urgency of the need for action against mr. hussein is a matter dividing many nations from washington. if mr. bush shows evidence that iraq is working busily to build a nuclear weapon and is becoming an immediate danger, quite a few nations might consider supporting military action against him. but many countries are concerned that the bush administration wants to drag them into a first strike against baghdad on the vaguer ground that mr. hussein might become a nuclear threat some time in the future. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter

Article 7 - can obama speak strongly for peace?
exclusive: sen. john mccain is baiting president obama for making america “look weak” and is demanding more aggressive responses toward syria, iran and russia. thus, obama faces a turning-point moment when he must confront neocon warmongering or surrender to it, reports robert parry. by robert parry with the neocons again ascendant and with the u.s. news media again failing to describe a foreign crisis honestly barack obama faces perhaps the greatest challenge of his presidency, a moment when he needs to find the courage to correct a false narrative that his own administration has spun regarding ukraine and to explain why it’s crucial to cooperate with russian president vladimir putin in the cause of world peace. in other words, if obama is to salvage his historical legacy, he must find within himself the strength and eloquence that president john f. kennedy displayed in possibly his greatest oration, his june 10, 1963 address at american university in washington, d.c. in that speech, kennedy outlined the need to collaborate with soviet leaders to avert dangerous confrontations, like the cuban missile crisis of 1962. kennedy also declared that it was wrong for america to seek world domination, and he asserted that u.s. foreign policy must be guided by a respect for the understandable interests of adversaries as well as allies. kennedy said: “what kind of peace do i mean and what kind of

Article 8 - e.u. imposes sanctions despite russian criticism
russia’s foreign minister, sergey v. lavrov, also criticized the visit by the foreign ministers of france, germany and poland, saying the european union had sent its “latest uninvited mission” to kiev to impose a solution by forcing mr. yanukovych to compromise. “how can you expect that your services will be in demand when the parallel threat of sanctions makes everything very similar to blackmail?” mr. lavrov said in remarks during a visit to iraq, according to the interfax news agency. advertisement continue reading the main story while russia has long criticized american and european diplomacy in ukraine, the tone of russia’s complaints has escalated along with the violence there, for which officials in moscow have consistently blamed radicals and extremists whom they have compared to the nazis. mr. lavrov’s remarks came the day after the united states announced that it would impose a travel ban on 20 civilian and political leaders in ukraine who officials said were directly responsible for ordering a crackdown in kiev that began on tuesday after protesters broke through police lines. the state department did not identify those sanctioned, but obama administration officials indicated that they had not targeted ukraine’s military command or apparently mr. yanukovych himself, leaving room for a compromise. administration officials also have been vague about the possibility of more sanctions. video josh earnest, the white house principal deputy press secretary, said thursday that there were “a range of tools that could

Title: obama declares self-determination to be a threat to us national security (video)
Content: (before it's news) via paul craig roberts in his march 6 executive order, “blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in ukraine,” obama declares that support for crimean self-determination constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states, and i hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.” http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/06/executive-order-blocking-property-certain-persons-contributing-situation obama and the lawyers who drafted his executive order did not notice that the way the order is drafted it applies to obama, to the unelected coup government in kiev, and to the washington and eu regimes. the order says that any person “responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly . . . actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in ukraine” is subject to having his assets frozen. washington and the eu are the only two governments whose personnel have undermined democratic processes and institutions in ukraine by overthrowing the elected government and imposing an unelected one. self-determination is pure democracy. i understand the implications of not being able to hold one’s country together but you know what, if the central government has become entrenched in corruption, greed and war mongering than, short of civil war, what other peaceful way can people get away from it? secession is a right. yes, a right that lincoln took away from the south. we were more than happy to let texas do it to mexico 15 years earlier but we crushed them when they tried to do it to us.

2550052.0,fake,reliable,0.9,75.9726619720459,False,"The article discusses the impact of the 9/11 attacks on humanity, which is a well-documented historical event. The summary provided by the RAG system aligns with this fact and does not contain any contradictions or unsupported claims. Additionally, the article mentions specific details such as the source URL and the title of the blog post, which further supports its reliability. The only discrepancy between the article and the summaries is the mention of new sitcoms being created to provide escapism during economic downturns, which is not present in the original article. However, this minor discrepancy does not significantly impact my confidence in the classification as RELIABLE.","A group of articles discuss various topics, including government shutdowns, debt ceiling deals, and the Tea Party movement. The articles express concerns about government overreach, national security, and economic policies.

The shutdown at the Lincoln Memorial is described as a form of civil disobedience, with ordinary Americans taking action against the government. A debt ceiling deal is criticized for being a ""fraud"" that will not lead to meaningful spending cuts or reforms.

The Tea Party movement is discussed in several articles, including one that describes an early event and another that questions America's global dependence. Another article highlights concerns about the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind and the need for education reform.

Some articles express skepticism about government actions, such as the NSA surveillance program and the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions. Others highlight the importance of national security and the need for vigilance against threats to American sovereignty.

Overall, these articles convey a sense of frustration with government policies and actions, and emphasize the need for accountability and reform.","Key points from the articles include:

* The 9/11 attacks had a profound impact on humanity, with survivors and victims sharing their stories to remember the past.
* New sitcoms are being created to provide escapism during economic downturns, targeting family-friendly audiences for advertisers.
* The assassination of John F. Kennedy is still remembered as a pivotal moment in American history, with some lamenting that the world has changed for the worse since then.
* The Iraq War is widely seen as a mistake, with many questioning the justification and consequences of the conflict.
* Collective memory can be toxic, fueling hatred and violence, according to author David Rieff.
* How people hear news about historical events affects their memories, with personal experiences being more vivid than media reports.
* The West has soured plans for commemorating World War II's V-E Day in Russia due to tensions over Ukraine.
* A project aims to preserve the voices of the Twin Towers by collecting and documenting recorded sounds from the time period.

Article 2 - 10 new sitcoms meant to cure the recession blues
 “when the economy’s not doing well, you tend to have more comedies, more escapism,” said steve sternberg, executive vice president for audience analysis at magna, part of the mediabrands division of the interpublic group of companies. several new sitcoms are particularly interesting, mr. sternberg said, because they are “family comedies scheduled before 9:30” — making them “programming you can watch with your kids.” viewers “are looking for that,” he added, so such shows are potentially desirable for advertisers. mr. sternberg praised an abc family sitcom he watched in preview form, “modern family,” as “one of the best pilots i’ve seen in years.” david campanelli, vice president and director for national television at horizon media, echoed that assessment. photo “it was the best one i’d seen in a while at the upfront,” mr. campanelli said, using the term derived from the practice of the networks’ presenting their schedules — and selling commercials — before the season starts. other forms of escapist entertainment for 2009-10 include new science fiction and fantasy series like “day one,” on nbc; “flash forward” and “v,” on abc; “human target” and “past life,” on fox; and “the vampire diaries,” on cw, owned by cbs and time warner. “you’ve got the dead, the undead and the almost dead,” said shari anne

those events left an indelible mark on our generation. charlie stough princeton, n.j., nov. 17, 2013 to the editor: i just finished the sunday papers, lamenting john f. kennedy’s assassination 50 years ago this coming friday. it was a friday then, too. i was 23, a law student at the university of new mexico. many times since, i have convinced myself that the world is a better place since that awful day, only to conclude later that now is not better than then. the tears running down my now white-bearded cheeks feel the same as my tears that friday afternoon. they are the only proof i have to offer my children and my grandchildren that for me the world has changed for the worse because of the shattered dream. notwithstanding the many conquered challenges to our very survival, which i gratefully acknowledge, the dream is still broken. dreams can be mended, and i profoundly hope that my grandchildren’s generation can put the dream back together. we desperately need a working dream. peter shoenfeld santa fe, n.m., nov. 17, 2013 to the editor: to fully appreciate the presidency of john f. kennedy, one had to experience it. the excitement of camelot is never in its reality; the excitement of camelot is always in its promise. those of us who were present on that bitterly cold january day in 1961 to hear the inaugural address, with

Article 4 - the gloom over this presidency
to the editor: it makes me furious that members of the bush administration are confident that events in iraq will improve and therefore help turn around the president's poll numbers in time for the midterm elections. the bottom line is that if things in iraq were perfect tomorrow, it still grows more and more evident that this is a war sold to the american people with lies and deceit. think of all the lives that have been lost, all those injured and the treasure spent. despite what the president says, we are less safe today than before the war started. these are the things that need to be remembered on election day. these are the things that should never be forgotten. suzanne victor southampton, pa., may 10, 2006

Article 5 - ‘in praise of forgetting,’ by david rieff
instead, he warns that all too often, collective memory “has led to war rather than peace . . . and to the determination to exact revenge rather than commit to the hard work of forgiveness.” for rieff, national remembrances are almost always political, sometimes imposed by victorious armies, at other times drummed up by manipulative politicians seeking to fabricate an epic past to legitimize their present-day intentions. he provides a depressing abundance of examples where toxic memories fuel atavistic hatred: among iraqis; israelis and palestinians; radical islamists across the globe; and hindu chauvinists rallied by the indian prime minister, narendra modi. this is no abstract dread for rieff, a distinguished journalist known for eviscerating american and european failures in bosnia and later for thoughtfully questioning the value of international humanitarian organizations. having been an eyewitness to yugoslavia’s collapse, he understands the grotesque realities of ethnic strife and power politics with stark clarity. he disgustedly recalls visiting a serb nationalist politician in belgrade who, as the war raged in bosnia, venerated the serbian guerrillas of world war ii, while one of his aides portentously handed rieff a piece of paper reading “1453” — the year when the ottoman empire conquered orthodox constantinople. worse, rieff worries that memory could not just spark violence, but prolong it. in order to end

Article 6 - remembrance of news past
likewise, whether you hear the news personally or learn it from the news media makes a difference. an individual is more likely to convey shock and genuine emotion, but not to include as much information as the news report. the psychologist john neil bohannon asked a large group of contemporary college students how they heard about the challenger shuttle disaster, while he tracked down alumni from the same college from 1942 to 1945 to ask them about pearl harbor. he found that in both sets, those who were told the news personally remembered more about what they were doing at the time, but if they heard it on the news or read it in a newspaper, they remembered more facts about the event. recalling the timing of an event is particularly tricky. in one experiment, professor kogure gave people a general description of a news event, like “a former member of the beatles was shot,” and then asked for his name, the date and the place. people were more likely to recall the name than the date. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. that’s not surprising, but the reason is instructive: working out

Article 7 - the west snubs russia over v-e day
exclusive: last year’s u.s.-backed coup in ukraine followed by violence and tensions has soured plans for the may 9 commemoration in moscow of world war ii’s v-e day, the allied defeat of nazi germany, a war which cost the russian people nearly 27 million dead, as ex-cia analyst ray mcgovern describes. by ray mcgovern the controversy over alleged russian “aggression” in ukraine is already raining on the kremlin parade with which russia will mark the 70th anniversary of the allies’ victory over adolf hitler and the nazis on may 9. u.s. president barack obama set the tone by turning down the kremlin’s invitation to take part in the celebration, and allies in western europe have been equally uncouth in saying no. the fanfare on red square will be a “last hurrah” for most surviving world war ii veterans, since few are likely to be able to be there for the 75th or 80th anniversaries. though i was only five years old on v-e day marking the victory in europe i was delighted to receive an invitation to go to russia this week for a smaller-scale celebration marking an equally important 70th anniversary april 25, 1945, the historic day on which u.s. and russian troops met at the elbe river. on v-e day, which came a couple of weeks later on may 9,

Article 8 - preserving the voices of the twin towers
as producers of ''lost and found sound,'' a peabody award-winning series broadcast since 1999 on national public radio, ms. nelson and ms. silva specialize in creating historical documentaries from fragments of recorded sound. they have constructed documentary segments based on such artifacts as recordings from the collection of a new york man who has been taping the sounds of street life since 1945, and ''audio letters'' recorded by a young american soldier shortly before he was killed in vietnam. (listeners can browse in the ''lost and found sound'' archives at www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound.) for the new project, the team is working to save any recorded material that chronicles the history of the world trade center and the attacks that destroyed it. voice-mail messages are a primary focus, ms. nelson said, although the group is also hoping to collect sounds from dictation tapes, tourist videos made before sept. 11, training films used by world trade center tenants, audio recordings of financial transactions or any other ''shards of sound that capture the expressions, exchanges, and humanity that defined the buildings.'' there have been unexpected discoveries, like a video e-mail message sent from a kiosk that was situated on the observation deck of the twin towers. the message was recorded by tourists who visited the world trade center last spring. the project invites anyone with audio artifacts related to the world trade center to call (202) 408-0300, the same national

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A group of articles discuss various topics, including government shutdowns, debt ceiling deals, and the Tea Party movement. The articles express concerns about government overreach, national security, and economic policies.

The shutdown at the Lincoln Memorial is described as a form of civil disobedience, with ordinary Americans taking action against the government. A debt ceiling deal is criticized for being a ""fraud"" that will not lead to meaningful spending cuts or reforms.

The Tea Party movement is discussed in several articles, including one that describes an early event and another that questions America's global dependence. Another article highlights concerns about the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind and the need for education reform.

Some articles express skepticism about government actions, such as the NSA surveillance program and the Obama administration's foreign policy decisions. Others highlight the importance of national security and the need for vigilance against threats to American sovereignty.

Overall, these articles convey a sense of frustration with government policies and actions, and emphasize the need for accountability and reform.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Key points from the articles include:

* The 9/11 attacks had a profound impact on humanity, with survivors and victims sharing their stories to remember the past.
* New sitcoms are being created to provide escapism during economic downturns, targeting family-friendly audiences for advertisers.
* The assassination of John F. Kennedy is still remembered as a pivotal moment in American history, with some lamenting that the world has changed for the worse since then.
* The Iraq War is widely seen as a mistake, with many questioning the justification and consequences of the conflict.
* Collective memory can be toxic, fueling hatred and violence, according to author David Rieff.
* How people hear news about historical events affects their memories, with personal experiences being more vivid than media reports.
* The West has soured plans for commemorating World War II's V-E Day in Russia due to tensions over Ukraine.
* A project aims to preserve the voices of the Twin Towers by collecting and documenting recorded sounds from the time period.

These points highlight the importance of remembering historical events, the impact of collective memory on society, and the complexities of international relations.

There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made in the article are supported by the information provided in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. The only discrepancy is that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY does not mention the specific details about the overtime reductions and its impact on officers, detectives, and supervisors, but these points are still relevant to the overall context of the article.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been criticized for its role in promoting globalism, not American interests. The agency's formation was predicated on the existence of terrorist threats, many of which were created or fabricated by government agencies.

In 2017, President Trump elevated United States Cyber Command to a unified combatant command focused on cyberspace operations. This move aims to strengthen US defense and deter adversaries.

Experts warn that the power grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, which could lead to widespread disruptions in essential services like food, water, and sanitation. The lack of self-reliance among Americans makes them weak against such threats.

The DHS chief, Janet Napolitano, has invoked 9/11 to push for legislation allowing greater government control over the internet. This move aims to prevent a ""cyber 9/11"" attack that could cause destruction similar to Hurricane Sandy.

Researchers warn of the militarization of civil society and the spread of fake news by government agencies and mainstream media. The CIA has been accused of peddling fake news, with newly-declassified documents showing its involvement in Operation Mockingbird.

A senior defense official, Leon Panetta, has predicted that a cyber attack could be as destructive as 9/11, leading to widespread societal breakdown. This warning highlights the potential risks of unchecked government control over critical infrastructure.

These articles highlight concerns about government control, cybersecurity threats, and the spread of misinformation.","Law enforcement agencies in the US are focusing on preventing terrorist organizations from establishing a presence within the country. The New York Police Department's intelligence and counterterrorism units have successfully managed a network of informants and undercover operatives, which has helped to prevent attacks such as the planned bombing of the New York subway system.

In other news, individuals with a knack for switching gears at the right moment are making significant contributions in various fields. For example, Michael Jackson leveraged his skills to become an executive vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz USA.

The US space agency is revising its budget to allocate more funds for the Space Shuttle and Hubble programs. The plan aims to speed up development of the crew vehicle and rocket that will launch it, potentially saving $1 billion or more in the near term.

Regarding healthcare, President Obama has announced plans to improve the Affordable Care Act's rollout, which has been marred by problems. Despite these challenges, over 100,000 Americans have successfully enrolled in new insurance plans since the marketplaces opened for business.

In international news, the Philippines is struggling with a cybercrime crisis due to its lack of internet laws. The country's low level of computerization has made it difficult to prosecute individuals who create and distribute viruses and worms.

The US administration is engaged in negotiations with North Korea over nuclear verification measures. The talks aim to find a way out of the verification morass, but progress has been slow due to disagreements over how much freedom inspectors should have to examine suspected nuclear sites.

In New York City, police are conducting Operation Clean Sweep to crack down on panhandlers, prostitutes, and squeegee men. The effort has resulted in over 70 arrests and nearly 200 summonses, with the goal of improving quality of life for residents.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

the dhs defends globalism, not america (before it's news) be prepared for the next great transfer of wealth. buy physical silver and storable food. alt-market.com tuesday, 07 february 2012 04:55 brandon smith the department of homeland security is the very epitome of unnecessary bureaucracy. its formation was predicated on the existence of terrorist threats, many of which the u.s. government and orbiting alphabet agencies either created through acts of war, or fabricated out of thin air. its policies of centralization were sold to the public as necessary to prevent systemic “miscommunications” that never actually took place. throughout our history, it has been a rare occasion indeed when an attack falls upon american infrastructure or interests that was not influenced, directly or indirectly, by the actions of agencies which were supposedly employed to prevent such events from ever occurring. whether through ‘blowback’, or through ‘false flag’, frankly, most of the harm that comes to our nation is perpetrated by the guiding hand of our inexorably corrupt government. knowing that the dhs was established on false pretenses forces us to question the agency’s true intentions, especially when a professional fear-monger like secretary janet napolitano announces that the globalization of the world economy falls within her jurisdiction: http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2012/01/27/the-urgent-need-to-protect-the-global-supply-chain/ average citizens would assume

michael mabee says government not prepared for any downed-grid scenarios (before it's news) off the grid news recently sat down with preparedness author and law enforcement expert michael mabee, whose latest book, “prepping for a suburban or rural community,” who argues that most prepping plans are insufficient if the power grid goes down. like a growing number of americans, mabee is concerned about the nation’s overly burdened and vulnerable power grid. otg: in prepping for a suburban or rural community, you focus on the need for all americans to become more self-reliant. do you feel, as many off-grid and homesteaders do, that being so dependent upon technology has made an entire generations of americans weak? michael mabee: we are generations removed from adversity and generations removed from self-reliance. this definitely makes us weak. anybody who lived through the great depression is in their 80s or 90s now. for most americans, we were born and grew up dependent on technology, specifically the power grid. we are not self-reliant – we are grid-reliant. everything is fine as long as all our infrastructures work – food, water, sanitation, medical care and our government. but all of these infrastructures – including basic rule of law – are completely dependent on the power grid. the majority of people don’t think of it; without the electric grid, there is no food, no water,

(before it's news) this april 2010 path breaking article foresaw what is now unfolding in front of our very eyes: the repeal of civil liberties, privacy and personal freedoms, war without borders internationally… unfailingly, defense industry boosters and corporate media acolytes promote the disturbing hypothesis annunciated by former director of national intelligence, mike mcconnell, that the nation is in peril. in a february washington post op-ed, the latest version of the “grave and gathering danger” big lie repeated endlessly by former president bush during the run-up to the iraq invasion, mcconnell claims that “the united states is fighting a cyber-war today, and we are losing.” since leaving the secret state’s employ, mcconnell returned to his old beltway bandit firm, booz allen hamilton, as a senior vice president in charge of the company’s national security business unit, a position he held after “retiring” as director of the national security agency back in 1996. critics, including security system design experts and investigative journalists, question the alarmist drumbeat that promises to dump tens of billions of federal dollars into the coffers of firms like mcconnell’s. indeed, washington technology reported two weeks ago that booz allen hamilton landed a $$20m contract to “foster collaboration among telecommunications

Article 1 - the terrorist next door
so law enforcement has to focus on preventing sophisticated terrorist organizations from establishing a presence within the united states. the good news is that we know how to do this. the bad news is we aren’t doing it enough. no other american city even attempts to do what new york has accomplished. the new york police department’s intelligence and counterterrorism units, working both with the f.b.i. and independently, manage a network of informant and undercover operatives around the area. it was no accident that last year when a denver man who was planning to bomb the new york subway system arrived in the city, the f.b.i. was aware of his travels, and a radical cleric he met with was already a police informant. of course, other american cities don’t have a police force with the manpower and experience of ours, but they can still do more. small cities can act independently or work with the f.b.i.’s 50 or so joint terrorism task forces to set up investigative teams — just a handful of officers in most cities — to identify violent cells within their jurisdictions. they know how to do it: the techniques and legal authorities to run informants and undercover agents and to install wiretaps on phones and computers are the same as police departments have long used to infiltrate the mob and drug trafficking organizations. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

friends say mr. jackson, 52, has had a lifelong knack for switching gears at the right moment. when fate intervened on cape cod, mr. jackson was headed for georgetown university law school. a political science major at st. joseph university in philadelphia, his hometown, he relished a return to washington, where he had marched against the vietnam war. ''i was chased with a billy club down dupont circle,'' he said. after his car was repaired, mr. jackson told his bride, ''i'm going to become a mechanic, not a lawyer.'' but he did go back to washington, where he was hired as a mechanic at a mercedes dealership. later, he leveraged his political science skills into a marketing job at mercedes. he eventually became a partner in a big mercedes dealer in bethesda, md., and was elected president of the mercedes national dealer council. his complaints that the brand had a stodgy image caught the attention of michael bassermann, then chief executive of mercedes-benz usa. in 1992, mr. bassermann hired mr. jackson as executive vice president for marketing.

Article 6 - national pride over a virus in philippines
asked what he felt about the damage, he looked down and mumbled, ''nothing.'' at one point, evading a question, he bent forward in his seat and covered his ears with his hands. his lawyer, rolando quimbo, who often translated his mumbled answers into full sentences, said the young man had come forward to demonstrate that he was not hiding from the law. he added: ''he is not really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him.'' this befuddlement seemed telling as this low-tech country finds itself the epicenter of an international furor over crime in cyberspace. because computers play such a small role in the philippines, it has never seen the need to write laws governing the internet. it will take some legal creativity to prove that the creator of the program -- a hybrid of varieties known as viruses and worms -- even committed a crime. for most students at schools like the ama computer college, where mr. de guzman studies, computer literacy is a ticket to a journeyman's job overseas, following in a tradition that has sent millions of filipinos abroad to work as laborers, nurses and domestic helpers. for most other filipinos, the computer is still a source of futuristic amazement. because of its low level of computerization, the philippines itself was not among the nations badly affected by the virus last week. this is a country of nearly 80 million people where only 200,000 computers

Article 8 - police return to a focus on panhandling and prostitution
police commissioner raymond w. kelly said yesterday that sweeps begun friday as part of a renewed effort to crack down on panhandlers, prostitutes and squeegee men have resulted in more than 70 arrests and nearly 200 summonses. mr. kelly and mayor michael r. bloomberg held a news conference in queens to announce the new effort, called operation clean sweep, which will use citizen complaints to a city telephone line and the compstat crime-tracking system to monitor seven low-level offenses. ''this is a very high priority,'' mr. kelly said as he stood on a sidewalk near queens plaza, an area that residents say has been beset by squeegee men and prostitutes since the sept. 11 terror attacks led to a reduction of patrol officers in the area. ''we want to assure new yorkers that we are concerned about the quality of life,'' mr. kelly said. ''in the wake of 9/11, there was a redeployment of police resources. we're now back focusing on these quality-of-life violations.'' advertisement continue reading the main story mr. kelly urged people to report low-level crimes by calling 888-677-life so the police could keep track of areas where the offenses are occurring. since before he took office, mr. bloomberg has stressed that he wants to renew the effort of his predecessor, rudolph w. giuliani, in focusing on lower-level crimes as a way to bring down the number of more serious

Title: kelly plans to cut money for overtime police patrols
Content: even as he acknowledged the budgetary constraints, mr. kelly said there were some things that the department could not do without. among them, he said, are increased counterterrorism training and new equipment, like protective suits and radiation detectors, which he expects will be paid for by the federal government, and an upgrade for the department's computer systems. in focusing on the department's technology, mr. kelly noted that the 55,000-person agency had no systemwide e-mail. ''i don't think you can find an organization in this country that size that doesn't have e-mail,'' he said. mr. kelly said he hoped to draw on the expertise of mayor michael r. bloomberg to improve the department's computer, communications and technology systems, areas in which solutions have long eluded department managers. mr. kelly said he would also try to solve some of those problems with outside contractors. the commissioner also said he planned to hire an outside consultant to evaluate the department's response to the world trade center attack, to better prepare should the city suffer another terrorist attack.

''that's the question.'' last year, the department spent as much as $10 million a month on the condor program, in which officers are assigned to work a sixth day in a week to bolster the police presence on city streets, officials said. for the next six months, the department will have

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Law enforcement agencies in the US are focusing on preventing terrorist organizations from establishing a presence within the country. The New York Police Department's intelligence and counterterrorism units have successfully managed a network of informants and undercover operatives, which has helped to prevent attacks such as the planned bombing of the New York subway system.

In other news, individuals with a knack for switching gears at the right moment are making significant contributions in various fields. For example, Michael Jackson leveraged his skills to become an executive vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz USA.

The US space agency is revising its budget to allocate more funds for the Space Shuttle and Hubble programs. The plan aims to speed up development of the crew vehicle and rocket that will launch it, potentially saving $1 billion or more in the near term.

Regarding healthcare, President Obama has announced plans to improve the Affordable Care Act's rollout, which has been marred by problems. Despite these challenges, over 100,000 Americans have successfully enrolled in new insurance plans since the marketplaces opened for business.

In international news, the Philippines is struggling with a cybercrime crisis due to its lack of internet laws. The country's low level of computerization has made it difficult to prosecute individuals who create and distribute viruses and worms.

The US administration is engaged in negotiations with North Korea over nuclear verification measures. The talks aim to find a way out of the verification morass, but progress has been slow due to disagreements over how much freedom inspectors should have to examine suspected nuclear

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been criticized for its role in promoting globalism, not American interests. The agency's formation was predicated on the existence of terrorist threats, many of which were created or fabricated by government agencies.

In 2017, President Trump elevated United States Cyber Command to a unified combatant command focused on cyberspace operations. This move aims to strengthen US defense and deter adversaries.

Experts warn that the power grid is vulnerable to cyber attacks, which could lead to widespread disruptions in essential services like food, water, and sanitation. The lack of self-reliance among Americans makes them weak against such threats.

The DHS chief, Janet Napolitano, has invoked 9/11 to push for legislation allowing greater government control over the internet. This move aims to prevent a ""cyber 9/11"" attack that could cause destruction similar to Hurricane Sandy.

Researchers warn of the militarization of civil society and the spread of fake news by government agencies and mainstream media. The CIA has been accused of peddling fake news, with newly-declassified documents showing its involvement in Operation Mockingbird.

A senior defense official, Leon Panetta, has predicted that a cyber attack could be as destructive as 9/11, leading to widespread societal breakdown. This warning highlights the potential risks of unchecked government control over critical infrastructure.

These articles highlight concerns about government control, cybersecurity threats, and the spread of misinformation.

There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, and all claims made by the article are supported by the summary. The only discrepancy is that the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY mentions a potential further rally to $1.4500, whereas the article does not provide a specific target price. However, this minor discrepancy does not affect my confidence in the classification as RELIABLE.","The articles discuss various economic and financial topics. The US dollar is weakening, leading to an increase in gold prices and the relative value of other currencies. This trend is expected to continue, with a potential further rally to $1.4500.

Emerging markets, such as Brazil, are experiencing significant losses due to currency carnage and political turmoil. The country's fiscal outlook is deteriorating, and alternative measures to avoid FX reserve liquidation are being used.

Forex data shows that the AUD/USD trading is in a bullish trend line, with buyers pushing prices higher despite weak movement from sellers. The EUR/USD is at a four-year low against the US dollar, and the euro's decline is attributed to the EU fiscal crisis.

The threat of debt, inflation, and slowdowns is affecting global markets, with big names dumping US dollars and no faith in the Fed. Quantitative easing is expected, with the potential for $2.5 trillion to be created to buy treasuries, agencies, and toxic waste.

Central banks' inflationism is visibly on the wane, and the collective delusion of grandeur is fading. The analysis highlights the importance of distinguishing between money and wealth, as well as credit and debt.

Recent economic data suggests a loss of momentum in recovery, with weak readings on personal income and spending, factory orders, and pending home sales. The US recovery may be slowing, and the impact of these trends will be felt in various markets.

Overall, the articles discuss significant economic and financial trends, including currency fluctuations, market volatility, and the potential for quantitative easing.","Key points from recent articles:

* The US dollar is expected to rise against the euro, potentially reaching parity within 6-12 months due to President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to spend heavily on infrastructure and defense while cutting taxes.
* Investors are fleeing risky assets like stocks for safe havens like gold and the yen as Trump's victory becomes more likely.
* The Brazilian real has stabilized after a sharp decline following Trump's election, with investors optimistic about President Michel Temer's reform agenda.
* Emerging markets have sold off since Trump's election due to concerns over tax cuts and potential rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
* Oil prices are volatile ahead of an OPEC meeting, with uncertainty over production caps fueling volatility.
* The Canadian dollar has hit an 8-month low against the US dollar after Trump's election, raising fears about Canada's trade-intensive economy.
* Gold prices have rallied, setting a 3.2% gain since the previous day, as investors seek safe havens in response to Trump's likely victory.

These points highlight key market trends and reactions to Trump's election, including currency fluctuations, asset price movements, and concerns over economic policy.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - how to take advantage of the current bull market in gold
how to take advantage of the current bull market in gold (before it's news) by david levenstein as the us dollar, the reserve currency of the world, continues to weaken, the price of gold as well as the relative value of other currencies will continue to increase. only last week, the price of gold made another historic high as it traded above $$1300 an ounce for the first time ever. the us dollar index dropped 0.91% to $$79.39 while the euro rallied 1.24% to $$1.34 vs. the dollar. the us dollar index which measures the relative value of the us dollar against a basket of six currencies broke a key support level of 80 and at one time traded as low as 79.36. the eur/usd broke the key resistance of 1.3330 which indicates that the low was posted around the beginning of june at 1.1875. in the short-term we should see a further rally to 1.4500. the usd/chf recently traded below parity, and since the beginning of the month, the australian dollar, the best performer of the 16 most traded currencies, has jumped 6.4 percent against the dollar, while the south african rand has gained almost 6 percent. the brazilian real has gained 1.7 percent and the new zealand and canadian dollars are up 4.4 percent and 3.6 percent respectively. for

Article 2 - a hapless brazil incurs massive losses on fx swaps amid currency carnage
a hapless brazil incurs massive losses on fx swaps amid currency carnage (before it's news) as we’ve documented extensively of late, a host of idiosyncratic political factors have served to exacerbate what was already a very, very bad situation for emerging markets. this dynamic is most readily apparent in brazil and turkey, and although ankara probably has a leg up in the race for “most at risk from domestic turmoil”, brazil isn’t far behind as president dilma rousseff battles abysmal approval ratings and a recalcitrant congress in an effort to shore up the country’s finances by convincing lawmakers to sign off on much needed austerity measures. meanwhile, a confluence of exogenous shocks that include slumping commodity prices, depressed chinese demand, the pboc yuan devaluation, and the threat of an imminent fed hike have conspired with country-specific political turmoil to send the brl plunging and that, in turn, has put copom in what former treasury secretary carlos kawall calls “crisis mode.” of course crises are often costly to combat, especially when you’re an emerging market in the current environment and when it comes to brazil, the use of alternative measures (like effectively selling dollars in the futures market) to avoid fx reserve liquidation is now weighing heavily on the fiscal outlook. as goldman noted earlier this week on the heels of the latest monthly budget data, “the overall fiscal deficit is tracking at a disquieting 9

Article 4 - a strand of greek optimism?
a strand of greek optimism? (before it's news) by andrew wilkinson at ib: the euro appears immune from the old adage that states, “no news is good news” falling instead to a four-year low versus the u.s. dollar. the number of bearish positions continues to build against the single currency according to cftc data and no wonder. despite an eu ministerial gathering in brussels today, there appears little risk of any coordinated plan to bolster errant fiscal ways to the extent that it would arrest the euro’s decline. the mounting number of sales of euros is a one-way bet that even in the cold-light of day is difficult to argue against at this point, although we all know how such train-wrecks tend to end. euro – the song remains the same for the euro to begin the week. it traded as low as $$1.2235 in european trading after stock market weakness in the asian time zone once again highlighted the risks to global growth that the situation appears to be creating. the obvious parallel that dealers are talking about is whether or not the eurozone fiscal crisis is as big as the banking crisis of 2008. as the fortunes of the euro wanes, the obvious beneficiaries have again been the dollar and the yen. the euro slipped to ¥112.47 at one point overnight although has picked up to ¥114.03 in early new york trading. a recent headline reported that greece expects to receive bailout money from

Article 6 - no buyers for treasuries or toxic waste
bob chapman ~ international forecaster april 27 2011: asia taking a pass on next round of quantitative easing, the threat of debt, prices, inflation, and slowdown, big names dumping us dollars, no more faith in the fed at pimco, a system that runs congress and the court system. we believe there will be something similar to a qe3 by another name and the fed will probably have to create some $2.5 trillion to buy treasuries, agencies, and toxic waste and perhaps inject funds into the economy. japan certainly won’t be a buyer and probably will be a seller. china has indicated that they won’t be purchasers in the future either. the question also arises concerning the continued purchase of these securities by countries in the oil producing gulf states, which are in turmoil. the three countries make up 45% of treasury purchases. as we pointed out in previous issues the second half of 2011 should be monstrous. even if the fed buys all the treasury and agency bonds they’ll still have to deal with a lower dollar and high inflation. then there is high unemployment and raging gold and silver prices. there is also the question of us debt, federal, state and municipal debt, along with wars in the middle east and north africa. how many us treasuries will japan have to sell and how deeply will its slowdown effect american industry? as you can see america has much to contemplate. the creation of monetary inflation will last at least

Article 7 - the collective delusion of grandeur fades: central bank inflationism is visibly on the wane
(before it's news) submitted by sean corrigan via true sinews blog, regular readers of these pages (whether here or in the author’s previous professional incarnations) will recognise that the analysis is informed by a core belief that while money should never be confused with wealth – and that therefore the latter cannot be conjured up by the central bank like a rabbit from a magician’s hat, however much people might wish it were so – the former is anything but neutral in its effect upon the creation, the distribution, and even the destruction of said wealth. a secondary, but still highly important distinction to which we insist it is necessary to hold fast is that money – the supreme present good, the demand liability instantly and universally redeemable today at par, the generally dominant (if not absolutely exclusive) medium responsible for the smooth and efficient exchange of goods and services, the great enabling mechanism which obviates the need not just for barter, but for interpersonal trust among a transaction’s counterparties – is different from credit – which latter is actually a claim on money (and hence on the potential to acquire all other goods) only realisable in the future. as walter boyd put it in his celebrated letter to pm william pitt of 1801 in which he excoriated both the bank of england’s wartime suspension of the convertibility of its issue and the ill-understood inflation to which it gave rise:- ‘by the words “means of circulation,” “circulating medium”

economic and bond market recap % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by bondsquawk: u.s. treasuries rallied and stocks fell as weak economic data suggested a loss of momentum in recovery. stocks pared some of its gains from yesterday while treasuries more than made up for its losses. economic data today’s economic data releases suggest that the u.s. recovery may be slowing as we head into the second half of 2010. the commerce department released figures that both personal income and personal spending failed to grow in june, following a tenth of a percent downward revision in the may readings to final levels of 0.3 and 0.1 percent, respectively. june’s flat readings disappointed economists as surveys called for an increase of 0.2 percent in personal income and a move higher of 0.1 percent in personal spending. factory orders unexpectedly dropped in june giving more reason of a slowdown in manufacturing activity, according to the u.s. department of commerce. factory orders fell by 1.2 percent versus surveys of a decline of 0.5 percent. to add insult to injury to the disappointment of missing expectations, the prior period’s reading was revised downward from an initial release of -1.4 percent to a final -1.8 percent. pending home sales dropped 2.6 percent on a month over month basis in june as government tax incentives expired for prospective home buyers.

business news | mon nov 28, 2016 | 3:50pm est amid trump selloff, brazil turnaround story outshines mexico u.s. president elect donald trump gestures to diners as he departs the lobby of the new york times building after a meeting in new york, u.s., november 22, 2016. reuters/lucas jackson by bruno federowski and dion rabouin | sao paulo/new york sao paulo/new york u.s. president-elect donald trump's surprise victory could be a blessing in disguise for brazil as the country's agenda of fiscal reform and low reliance on trade lure investors away from more vulnerable mexican markets. emerging markets have sold off since the nov. 8 election on concerns tax cuts and heavy infrastructure spending under a trump administration could force the federal reserve to hike rates faster, potentially draining capital from high-yielding assets in the developing world. many also fear a global trade shock if trump makes good on campaign pledges to review trade accords. the brazilian real tumbled 8 percent in the four days following the vote, the second-worst performing currency in latin america behind the mexican peso. but the real has since stabilized to around 3.40 to the dollar as the initial shock faded. investors say optimism over president michel temer's reform agenda has lifted foreign direct investment in brazil and left it less exposed to market volatility in the wake of trump's win.

""we see $1.05 for euro versus dollar by end of year but a move towards parity within six to 12 months is entirely possible"". the currencies specialist said the move would be exacerbated by euro reaction to political events in europe. ""we think given the election calendar for europe over the next three to six months is liable to have its own upset for non-establishment parties or policies coming in to play,"" hafeez said. trump's election pledges to spend heavily on infrastructure and defense while cutting taxes is seen as only possible if the u.s. government auctions off more government bonds sweetened with higher rates

Article 3 - good investors use currency fluctuations as opportunities
traveling to foreign countries is always an interesting experience. aside from dealing with the long airport lines and full-cavity body searches, many people find the journey of going to a faraway land as incredibly exciting. when you go to these faraway places, one of the routines you become accustomed to is exchanging u.s dollars for the local currency . many people get surprised by the different amounts of local money they have once their dollars are turned in. when the dollar is strong, u.s citizens benefit by having more foreign capital to use, and vice versa when the dollar is weak. conversely, foreign travelers love to come to the u.s. when their currencies are strong relative to the u.s. dollar. over the last few years, when the dollar was very weak, many foreigners came here not just to splurge on vacations, but to buy prime real estate locations in large urban cities where good situations are difficult to find. the same phenomenon has been taking place in canada, specifically toronto and vancouver, as the canadian dollar fell versus many major international currencies, especially the chinese yuan and renmimbi. clearly, fluctuating global currencies are a constant in volatile international capital markets. consequently, there can be plenty of ways to capitalize on the wide swings of currencies. in the latter part of 2015, commodity prices swung to a generational low and the currencies of any country that is dependent on these commodities saw their currencies also hit generational lows. the most foremost example of this

Recent economic data suggests a loss of momentum in recovery, with weak readings on personal income and spending, factory orders, and pending home sales. The US recovery may be slowing, and the impact of these trends will be felt in various markets.

the cannock chase panther (before it's news) (image: wikipedia) since the 1970′s literally hundreds (if not, thousands) of big cat sightings have been reported from within the chase’s mysterious plantation, often by seemingly rational and trustworthy witnesses. in truth, these accounts have received more publicity within the national and international press than any other phenomena reported in the area, so predictably this is a very hot topic that creates a whole load of controversy – something i’m a huge fan of. in 1976 the dangerous animals act came into force in england, which made it illegal to keep fierce and predatory creatures as pets without a licence. the problem was though, many people already had these animals, and thanks to parliament, they were now breaking the law. without having much choice in the matter, pet owners far and wide began releasing their ferocious, wild beasts into secluded countryside locations. unfortunately, many of these animals would have struggled to survive unaided in england, however, is it possible that some species were more suited to our climate than others? have exotic cats been breeding secretly for the last 40 years? some journalists and researchers would argue that the evidence suggests they have.

Article 3 - dismal end for race dogs, alabama authorities say
today, mr. rhodes was charged with three counts of animal cruelty, a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. mr. rhodes insisted that he always shot dogs once in the brain. ''it was quick,'' he told the pensacola news journal. ''they didn't feel a thing.'' but district attorney david whetstone said three of the four dogs his investigators dug up on tuesday had been shot in the mouth or the neck. ''none would have died instantly,'' he said. the discovery of mr. rhodes's animal-disposal operation exposed what animal-rights advocates have long described as the lethal underbelly of the waning greyhound racing and parimutuel industry in the united states, in which as many as 34,000 puppies are born a year and 24,000 dogs registered to race on any of 48 tracks in 15 states. ''we know there are many animals produced for racing, and that the industry does not have sanctuaries or shelters to place animals that are no longer useful to them on the racetrack,'' said wayne pacelle, senior vice president of the humane society of the united states. ''they're doing something with them. the information we've had over the years is that they are killing them, disposing of them. they are raised for commercial purposes and when they don't produce, they are expendable.'' advocates recalled similar cases in the united states, but none involving as many dogs.

Article 4 - tasmania is out of this world
now, where again is tasmania? some african nation that’s shucked off its colonial name? one of captain cook’s stopovers during his polynesian tour? it’s a question even tasmanians ask themselves, having seen their island-state 150 miles off the southeast coast of australia sometimes left off the map. “we were an offshore island off the shore of an offshore continent, victims of a twofold alienation,” wrote peter conrad in his memoir of a tasmanian childhood. “australia was chosen for settlement because it was so remote, and because it could scarcely sustain life. it served as a place of ultimate banishment and estrangement. yet beneath its south-eastern tip was an even remoter version of itself, a site of internal exile.” for much of its history, tasmania — or van diemen’s land, as it was called until 1856 — was known, if it was known at all, for its brutality. throughout the first half of the 19th century, it was the site of australia’s most lethal penal colony. it also witnessed one of the world’s most efficient genocides: the european settlers’ slaughter of the island’s aboriginal population. as hunters drove the island’s most distinguished megafauna, the thylacine (or tasmanian tiger), to extinction; as the hydroelectric industry dammed rivers and drowned mountains; and as timber companies left valleys looking like the hide of some wild

Article 5 - animals? in a zoo? heavens!
animals? in a zoo? heavens! q. i love visiting the bronx zoo, but i always wonder: does the zoo have a problem with wild animals moving in, like skunks, raccoons and possums? a. well, the zoo doesn’t exactly consider them a problem, but it doesn’t ignore them, either. “it’s no secret that there is native wildlife on the grounds of the bronx zoo,” said patrick thomas, general curator of the zoo. animals like skunks and raccoons are nocturnal; because they usually don’t show themselves during the day, visitors rarely see them. when such an animal does appear during the day, dr. thomas said, it may be sick and thus a threat to visitors, staff and the zoo’s animals. an animal department team traps the creature, which is then examined in the zoo’s wildlife health center. if the animal is sick and possibly rabid, it is killed humanely, and the remains are sent to the state veterinarian.

photo ‘‘go with the grain of the hair,’’ says anthony eddy, a taxidermist who has worked on house cats, bobcats and mountain lions. the cleanest of the many ways to skin a cat begins with a so-called dorsal cut. start at the bottom of the skull, and cut a straight line to the base of the tail along the spine. ‘‘always use a sharp blade,’’ says eddy, who prefers a carbon steel scalpel. peel the skin back as you would an orange. trim carefully around the paws, mouth, nose and eyes. this is obviously not work for the squeamish, but to make a lifelike remembrance of an animal means doing things that make its death inescapable. for larger specimens, eddy opts for traditional taxidermy, pulling the tanned skin over a polyurethane manikin. for house cats, he prefers freeze-drying, which retains the unique characteristics of a pet’s face and involves replacing the internal organs and fat with silicone, then drying the posed body in a machine for up to seven months. ‘‘when a hunter brings in a deer, they just want it to look like a deer,’’ eddy says. ‘‘cat owners don’t want a generic cat — they want fluffy.’’ put any creature you want preserved in the freezer within two hours of its death; rigor mortis sets in as soon as the body cools. ‘‘bacteria is

Article 7 - a hint of danger in the forest
the boar i met up against the fence wasn’t a threat. it was a captive boar, safely behind wire, but all the same, it forced me to consider my own place in the world. because britain had no boars for centuries, nearly everything i know about them is made of older stories. i couldn’t help thinking of this boar as a semilegendary beast charging straight out of the medieval literature i read in my undergraduate years. this was the quarry hunted in ‘‘sir gawain and the green knight’’ and thomas malory’s ‘‘le morte d’arthur,’’ a creature renowned for its formidable ferocity and power. in medieval romances, boars are seen as a challenge to masculinity and hunting them a test of endurance and bravery. what animals mean to us is made of everything we’ve ever heard and seen and read about them, and when we meet them, we expect them to conform to these remembered stories. but there is always a gap of surprise. crows, for example, seem less like murderous vermin after you’ve seen a pair sliding playfully down a snowy roof. living animals resist the meanings we give them. photo humans have a long history of territorial anxieties about wild animals intruding on our spaces. in the 17th century, the english garden writer william lawson advised on the tools you need to keep your property free of marauding beasts, including a ‘‘f

Article 8 - adventure in the pantanal
we arrived at the gateway of caiman after a 90-minute flight from são paulo to the city of campo grande. the boys' faces fell when our driver, senhor carlos, announced there were still 26 miles of rough, dirt road ahead before we would reach the ranch headquarters, surrounded by savanna and dotted with huge shade trees. but their spirits lifted again when we passed a flock of greater rheas, large ostrichlike creatures, grazing among the ranch's herd of white, humpbacked cattle and, on rounding a bend, skirted a muddy lagoon whose shores were teeming with crusty-looking caimans, their mouths gaping to reduce their body temperatures (they are quite used to having humans around). senhor carlos told us that, the day after next, we would be feeding the jacarés, as the brazilians call caimans, with raw meat. we dropped in at the ranch's main building -- a low, pinkish structure with rooms arranged around a central swimming pool -- to check in and then drove another five miles to our lodge. called baiazinha (little bay), the lodge, one of four at caiman, perches on wooden stilts over a lake that is a microcosm of pantanal wildlife. michael was spooked at first by a four-foot caiman lazing on the lawn under the walkway to the lodge entrance. its back covered with water irises and other plant life from

Title: large panther like cat stalking wales and killing badgers
Content: (before it's news) according to locals a large cat is stalking the countryside of northern wales. the big cats of the uk are one of the most commonly seen cryptids in the world, but have still managed to remain hidden from modern man and technology. 30-year-old rhys waters, one of the producers of the unexplainers, told cryptozoology news that the sightings and animal killings in the snowdonia region have been reportedly happening for about six years. “the closest sighting being around 10 feet away,” waters says about an anonymous family that allegedly saw the “puma”. farmers in the area claim hearing unidentified animal calls and strange noises they describe as “guttural purrs” or the sound of a “giant bee”. “also, they have found lots of badgers with wounds they believe indicate a big cat kill,” he said.”the night we did a stakeout a lamb was killed by an unknown predator. we are completely shocked that this happened during our stay at the farm.”

There are no significant contradictions between the article and the summary. The article also mentions Daniel Lazare's criticism of the battle plan, which is mentioned in the Reliable News Summary. However, the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains several inaccuracies, such as the claim that the US has been involved in a proxy war since 2007 (the article does not specify the starting year) and the assertion that the conflict is about regime change without mentioning Daniel Lazare's criticism of the battle plan. Overall, the Reliable News Summary provides a more accurate representation of the article's content.","The US-led Western nations have been involved in a proxy war in Syria since 2007, using Islamic State and other Takfiri terrorists as foot soldiers. The conflict has escalated into a full-blown war on Assad's government, with the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel complicit in the campaign.

The US has provided thousands of tons of weapons to militants in Syria, including Al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, Jabhat al-Nusra. The US State Department acknowledges that Syria faces a threat from Al-Qaeda and demands a blockade of arms and aid reaching the government to fight terrorists.

The conflict is not about democracy or sectarianism but rather the destruction of Syria as a whole. The US-led Western nations plan to escalate the war on Assad, with Britain, Canada, and Israel involved in covert bombing operations.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Kurdish dissident Sherkoh Abbas argues that the US should support the Kurdish independence referendum, which could bring an end to the Shia Crescent and allow for better confrontation of Iranian aggression in the region.

The US agenda in Syria is war, not peace, with regime change being the objective. The conflict resolution is as simple as ending support for terrorist groups like ISIS. However, escalated support looks likely, with Washington's strategy of choice.

In summary, the US-led Western nations have been involved in a proxy war in Syria since 2007, using Islamic State and other Takfiri terrorists as foot soldiers. The conflict has escalated into a full-blown war on Assad's government, with the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel complicit in the campaign.","Key points:

* Bashar al-Assad stated that Donald Trump would be a ""natural ally"" if he fights ""terrorists"".
* US-approved arms for Libyan rebels fell into the hands of Islamic militants.
* A US general said raiding Syria is key to halting ISIS, but airstrikes in Syria draw the White House deeper into conflict.
* The US helped unleash hell on Syria and across the Middle East by supporting jihadist proxies despite their extremist views.
* Syrian refugees are being treated harshly in Iraq, with restrictions imposed by the Shi'ite-dominated government.
* Washington's hawks encouraged Turkey to invade Syria but worry about a possible clash between Turkey and Iraq.
* Hints of a Syrian chemical push have set off a global effort to stop it, with chemical munitions stored near or on Syrian air bases.
* Obama sees Russia failing in its efforts to combat ISIS in Syria.

These points highlight the complexities of US foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly regarding Syria and ISIS.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama
endgame: putin to bomb isis with or without obama (before it's news) on sunday, we noted that washington’s strategy in syria has now officially unravelled. john kerry, speaking from london following talks with british foreign secretary philip hammond, essentially admitted over the weekend that russia’s move to bolster the assad regime at latakia effectively means that the timing of assad’s exit is now completely indeterminate. here’s how we summed up the situation: moscow, realizing that instead of undertaking an earnest effort to fight terror in syria, the us had simply adopted a containment strategy for isis while holding the group up to the public as the boogeyman par excellence, publicly invited washington to join russia in a once-and-for-all push to wipe islamic state from the face of the earth. of course the kremlin knew the us wanted no such thing until assad was gone, but by extending the invitation, putin had literally called washington’s bluff, forcing the white house to either admit that this isn’t about isis at all, or else join russia in fighting them. the genius of that move is that if washington does indeed coordinate its efforts to fight isis with moscow, the us will be fighting to stabilize the very regime it sought to oust. revelations (which surprised no one but the pentagon apparently) that moscow is coordinating its efforts in syria with tehran only serve to reinforce

Article 2 - syria, yemen, and america’s quest for imperial dominance
(before it's news) neo-imperialism by faux-democracy, terrorism, and propaganda. may 25, 2012 – at the g8 summit last week, president obama and other officials in his administration, began utilizing the talking point of yemen being a model to be emulated in syria. ostensibly, they were referring to the “peaceful” transition of power in yemen as an example of what they would like to see in syria. however, the comparison goes much deeper than simply this superficial connection. the truth is that yemen represents, in more ways than one, the blueprint that the us imperialist ruling class would like to see applied to the escalating conflict in syria. puppet regimes and faux democracy the “transition” of power in yemen, from saleh to hadi, is a prime example of the hypocrisy of us policy, touting it as a victory for democracy while concealing the obvious fact that it was the creation of a puppet regime. abed rabbo mansour hadi has been presented as the legitimate leader of yemen, despite the fact that he was the u.s. choice to govern that country. his legitimacy depended on the myth of a democratically elected regime; the us propagates this myth wantonly, pretending that people won’t remember that hadi ran unopposed in february. if the purpose of democracy is to create forms of governance accountable to the citizenry and to establish a government that is truly representative

Article 6 - syrian kurdish dissident: “america should support the kurdish independence referendum”
syrian kurdish dissident: “america should support the kurdish independence referendum” (before it's news) on september 25, kurdistan is holding a referendum for independence. already, aldar khalil, the government spokesman for the kurdish region in syria, expressed that the syrian kurds are interested in a confederation with iraqi kurdistan. given the divisions between the krg who has positive trade relations with turkey and khalil’s group who is working together with the assad regime, syrian kurdish dissident sherkoh abbas argued that it is a good sign. he emphasized that for a number of reasons, the united states of america should welcome this development and support the kurdish referendum for independence. khalil stressed that for starters, an independent kurdistan will bring the shia crescent to a halt. according to abbas, saudi arabia and other sunni gulf states have recently started to view an independent kurdistan in a positive light just so that they will be able to confront iranian aggression in the middle east region better. he noted that this has been reflected in their social media: “the gcc had israel as enemy number one and the kurds as number two. now that has changed. now, they are willing to divide iraq and syria so that it could be a buffer against iran. they view it positively as a way to

06:06 ist email comments bashar al-assad is the current president of syria. (file photo) damascus: syria's bashar al-assad said in an interview aired on tuesday that donald trump will be a ""natural ally"" if the us president-elect fulfils his pledge to fight ""terrorists"".in his first reaction to trump's election victory last week, the syrian president struck a note of caution and said he was unsure the american billionaire would be able to keep his word and step up the fight against jihadists.""we cannot tell anything about what he's going to do, but if... he is going to fight the terrorists, of course we are going to be ally, natural ally in that regard with the russian, with the iranian, with many other countries,"" he told portugal's rtp state television. asked about trump's campaign comments suggesting the united states should focus more on fighting the isis, assad said he would welcome such a move but was cautious.""i would say this is promising, but can he deliver?"" said assad, who was speaking in english.""can he go in that regard? what about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him? how can he deal with it?"" he said.""that's why for us it's still dubious whether he can do or live up to his promises or not.""that's why we are very cautious in judging him, especially as he

Article 2 - u.s.-approved arms for libya rebels fell into jihadis’ hands
the united states, which had only small numbers of c.i.a. officers in libya during the tumult of the rebellion, provided little oversight of the arms shipments. within weeks of endorsing qatar’s plan to send weapons there in spring 2011, the white house began receiving reports that they were going to islamic militant groups. they were “more antidemocratic, more hard-line, closer to an extreme version of islam” than the main rebel alliance in libya, said a former defense department official. the qatari assistance to fighters viewed as hostile by the united states demonstrates the obama administration’s continuing struggles in dealing with the arab spring uprisings, as it tries to support popular protest movements while avoiding american military entanglements. relying on surrogates allows the united states to keep its fingerprints off operations, but also means they may play out in ways that conflict with american interests. “to do this right, you have to have on-the-ground intelligence and you have to have experience,” said vali nasr, a former state department adviser who is now dean of the paul h. nitze school of advanced international studies, part of johns hopkins university . “if you rely on a country that doesn’t have those things, you are really flying blind. when you have an intermediary, you are going to lose control.” he said that qatar would not have gone through with the arms shipments if the united states had resisted them, but other current and former

Article 3 - u.s. general says raiding syria is key to halting isis
in the current battle with isis inside iraq, mr. obama’s military strategy has been aimed at containing the militant organization rather than defeating it, according to defense department officials and military experts. pressed on whether the united states would conduct airstrikes on isis targets in syria, mr. hagel said that “we’re looking at all options.” any use of air power involves risk, including the possibility that innocent civilians may be hurt or killed, or that a piloted aircraft might be shot down. airstrikes in syria would also draw the white house more deeply into a conflict from which it has sought to maintain some distance. but there is also risk in not acting, because it is very difficult to defeat a militant group that is allowed to maintain a sanctuary. in planning its campaign against isis, american military officers have been contending with a highly mobile force that can move across the iraq-syria border with impunity. to the consternation of american officials, isis has been using captured american equipment, including humvees and at least one heavily armored troop transport vehicle. american intelligence officials have reported that the group has seized 20 russian t-55 tanks in syria, armor that isis could try to employ in western iraq. according to one american intelligence estimate, isis could not be easily defeated by killing its top leadership. given its decentralized command and control, experienced militants could easily replenish its upper ranks. photo “if there is anything isil

Article 4 - when washington cheered the jihadists
exclusive: official washington helped unleash hell on syria and across the mideast behind the naïve belief that jihadist proxies could be used to transform the region for the better, explains daniel lazare. by daniel lazare when a department of defense intelligence report about the syrian rebel movement became public in may 2015, lots of people didn’t know what to make of it. after all, what the report said was unthinkable – not only that al qaeda had dominated the so-called democratic revolt against syrian president bashar al-assad for years, but that the west continued to support the jihadis regardless, even to the point of backing their goal of creating a sunni salafist principality in the eastern deserts. the united states lining up behind sunni terrorism – how could this be? how could a nice liberal like barack obama team up with the same people who had brought down the world trade center? it was impossible, which perhaps explains why the report remained a non-story long after it was released courtesy of a judicial watch freedom-of-information lawsuit. the new york times didn’t mention it until six months later while the washington post waited more than a year before dismissing it as “loopy” and “relatively unimportant.” with isis rampaging across much of syria and iraq, no one wanted to admit that u.s. attitudes were ever anything other than hostile. but three years earlier, when the defense intelligence agency was compiling the report

Article 5 - syrian refugees are stung by a hostile reception in iraq
the shiite-dominated government of prime minister nuri kamal al-maliki in iraq, while officially neutral, has been supportive of president bashar al-assad of syria, whose ruling alawite sect is an offshoot of shiite islam. last week, for instance, iraq abstained from supporting a resolution by the arab league calling for mr. assad to step down, calling it unwarranted interference in syria’s internal affairs. though syrians have been fleeing the unrest in their country for months, iraq did not open its borders to refugees until last week, after protests from the sunni tribes in anbar province. the bukamal border crossing, near this city, is the most problematic one for iraq, with the syrian side now under the control of opposition forces. photo the restrictions baghdad has imposed on refugees proved so severe that on friday, representatives of the anbar tribes and hundreds of followers took to the streets in the 125-degree midday heat to protest the treatment of the newly arriving syrians, many of whom have family and tribal connections with iraqis here. “we can’t even go see them,” said mohamed hassan, an iraqi sheik who took part in the protest. like many others, mr. hassan complained that the refugees were being treated like criminals, kept under military guard in 11 school buildings and one mosque and denied any visitors or permission to

Article 6 - us hawks gamble on turkey’s invasions
exclusive: the mideast chaos gets more and more complicated as washington’s hawks encourage turkey to invade syria but worry about a possible clash between turkey and iraq, a maelstrom of violence that could spin out of control, writes joe lauria. by joe lauria as turkey mobilizes fresh troops on the iraqi border, iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi has warned that turkey’s invasion of his country will mean war. “turkey and its forces will be damaged and we warn them again, if their troops enter iraq we will fight them and we will look at them and treat them as the enemy,” he said. turkey has threatened to take part in the u.s.-led military operation to liberate mosul, iraq’s second-largest city now occupied by islamic state militants. turkey already has illegally deployed troops inside iraq but the broader invasion deeper into iraqi territory from an attack on mosul would represent a more direct challenge to iraqi sovereignty. “if we engage in war with them, the turks will pay a heavy price, they will be damaged,” al-abadi vowed to reporters in baghdad last tuesday. “we warn turkey if they want to enter iraq, they will end up becoming fragmented,” because turkey is “not a country to able to fight outside their borders.” turkey invaded cyprus 50 years ago, he said. “but iraq is not cyprus.” the silence to

Article 7 - hints of syrian chemical push set off global effort to stop it
“i think the russians understood this is the one thing that could get us to intervene in the war,” one senior defense official said last week. “what assad understood, and whether that understanding changes if he gets cornered in the next few months, that’s anyone’s guess.” while chemical weapons are technically considered a “weapon of mass destruction” — along with biological and nuclear weapons — in fact they are hard to use and hard to deliver. whether an attack is effective can depend on the winds and the terrain. sometimes attacks are hard to detect, even after the fact. syrian forces could employ them in a village or a neighborhood, some officials say, and it would take time for the outside world to know. but the scare a month ago has renewed debate about whether the west should help the syrian opposition destroy mr. assad’s air force, which he would need to deliver those 500-pound bombs. the chemical munitions are still in storage areas that are near or on syrian air bases, ready for deployment on short notice, officials said. the obama administration and other governments have said little in public about the chemical weapons movements, in part because of concern about compromising sources of intelligence about the activities of mr. assad’s forces. this account is based on interviews with more than half a dozen military, intelligence and diplomatic officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the intelligence matters involved. the head of germany ’s foreign intelligence service, the

some of those regional allies joined the united states and europe in friday’s statement condemning russian actions and urging moscow to focus any strikes on the islamic state. “these military actions constitute a further escalation and will only fuel more extremism and radicalization,” said the statement, signed by the united states, france, germany, britain, qatar, saudi arabia and turkey. mr. kerry met with foreign minister mohammad javad zarif of iran, who was in new york for the united nations meeting. the state department said that the zarif meeting focused on the recent nuclear agreement, but an iranian official suggested that syria also came up. mr. kerry also met with yusuf bin alawi, the foreign minister of oman, which was a central intermediary with iran leading to the nuclear deal. syria welcomed russia’s help on friday. foreign minister walid al-moallem, addressing the united nations general assembly, said the russian operations were part of an effort to fight terrorism, and he ridiculed western advocacy for political changes during such a battle. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Key points:

* Bashar al-Assad stated that Donald Trump would be a ""natural ally"" if he fights ""terrorists"".
* US-approved arms for Libyan rebels fell into the hands of Islamic militants.
* A US general said raiding Syria is key to halting ISIS, but airstrikes in Syria draw the White House deeper into conflict.
* The US helped unleash hell on Syria and across the Middle East by supporting jihadist proxies despite their extremist views.
* Syrian refugees are being treated harshly in Iraq, with restrictions imposed by the Shi'ite-dominated government.
* Washington's hawks encouraged Turkey to invade Syria but worry about a possible clash between Turkey and Iraq.
* Hints of a Syrian chemical push have set off a global effort to stop it, with chemical munitions stored near or on Syrian air bases.
* Obama sees Russia failing in its efforts to combat ISIS in Syria.

These points highlight the complexities of US foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly regarding Syria and ISIS.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US-led Western nations have been involved in a proxy war in Syria since 2007, using Islamic State and other Takfiri terrorists as foot soldiers. The conflict has escalated into a full-blown war on Assad's government, with the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel complicit in the campaign.

The US has provided thousands of tons of weapons to militants in Syria, including Al-Qaeda's Syrian franchise, Jabhat al-Nusra. The US State Department acknowledges that Syria faces a threat from Al-Qaeda and demands a blockade of arms and aid reaching the government to fight terrorists.

The conflict is not about democracy or sectarianism but rather the destruction of Syria as a whole. The US-led Western nations plan to escalate the war on Assad, with Britain, Canada, and Israel involved in covert bombing operations.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Kurdish dissident Sherkoh Abbas argues that the US should support the Kurdish independence referendum, which could bring an end to the Shia Crescent and allow for better confrontation of Iranian aggression in the region.

The US agenda in Syria is war, not peace, with regime change being the objective. The conflict resolution is as simple as ending support for terrorist groups like ISIS. However, escalated support looks likely, with Washington's strategy of choice.

In summary, the US-led Western nations have been involved in a proxy war in Syria since 2007, using Islamic State and other Takfiri terrorists as foot soldiers. The conflict has escalated into a full-blown war on Assad's

Article 2 - the divine mercy from both a catholic and an orthodox perspective.;
the divine mercy from both a catholic and an orthodox perspective.; (before it's news) st. john chrysostom the blood and water that flowed from christ’s side on the cross were symbols of the eucharist and baptism, prefigured by the blood of the passover lamb, says john chrysostom, one of the greatest preachers of the early church. if we wish to understand the power of christ’s blood, we should go back to the ancient account of its prefiguration in egypt. “sacrifice a lamb without blemish”, commanded moses, “and sprinkle its blood on your doors”. if we were to ask him what he meant, and how the blood of an irrational beast could possibly save men endowed with reason, his answer would be that the saving power lies not in the blood itself, but in the fact that it is a sign of the lord’s blood. in those days, when the destroying angel saw the blood on the doors he did not dare to enter, so how much less will the devil approach now when he sees, not that figurative blood on the doors, but the true blood on the lips of believers, the doors of the temple of christ. if you desire further proof of the power of this blood, remember where it came from, how it ran down from the cross, flowing from the master’s side. the gospel records that when christ was dead, but still hung on the cross, a soldier came

Article 3 - feast of the sacred heart: christ's heart in ours and ours in christ's
(before it's news) our catholic faith reaches up to heaven, out to our neighbour, and down into the depths of the soul. these three dimensions seem to divide our efforts into three separate tasks, liturgy, love of our neighbour and contemplation, tasks which keep on getting in each other’s way. however, for those who persevere to the end, they are seen to be inseparable, all three being dimensions of any authentically strong relationship with god, all three leading to the same goal and doorways into the same place. in this essay we are going to look at the heart and discover how it connects us to heaven, to earth and to the whole cosmos. we shall then be able to see the relevance of devotion to the sacred heart of jesus. let us start with three quotations from thomas merton. we must begin by frankly admitting that the first place in which to go looking for the world is not outside us but in ourselves. we are the world. in the deepest ground of our being we remain in metaphysical contact with the whole of that creation in which we are only small parts. through our senses and our minds, our loves, needs, and desires, we are implicated, without possibility of evasion, in this world of matter and of men, of things and of persons, which not only affect us and change our lives but are also affected and changed by us…the question, then, is not to speculate about how we are to contact the world

Article 4 - god’s creating heart
white powdery snowflakes fall silently from the murky sky settling in quiet majesty upon the earth, this onslaught from on high i watch as this celestial carpet now adorns the face of god’s creation the sight stills my soul, leading me to prayer, a fruitful contemplation i wonder at the simplicity, marvel at the complexity, the sheer ingenuity of the creating heart of god who prepares our imagination for eternity fr patrick brennan © 2012

Article 5 - the ascension and the eternal liturgy by jean corbon o.p.
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the ascension and the eternal liturgy ”the river of life, rising from the throne of god and of the lamb” (rev 22:1), flowed hidden in the passage of the time of the promises and god’s patience. but “when the completion of the time came” (gal 4:4), that is, when the incarnation occurred, the river entered into our world and assumed our flesh. in the “hour” of the cross and the resurrection it sprang forth from the incorruptible and life-giving body of christ. from that moment on it has been and is liturgy. a new period thus began within “the present time” (1) in which after its decisive defeat death carries on its war on all fronts but in which, at the same time, the passage of the lord continues to penetrate the depths of humanity and history. we are in “the last times.” (2) just as the hour of jesus has his cross and his resurrection as inseparable phases, so too the “moment” or “date” (kairos) (3) which begins the “last times” has the lord’s ascension and the outpouring of his spirit as inseparable phases. the relation between the “hour” and this special date or moment is to be looked for not in their chronological succession (to look for it there would be to remain at the level of

Article 6 - the teachings of st. john cassian on praxis and contemplation by alexey fokin
the teachings of st. john cassian on praxis and contemplation by alexey fokin headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! 1. introduction. as is well known, st. john cassian (c. 360-435), known in the byzantine and russian tradition as roman[1], occupies an important place among ascetic writers and theologians of the patristic age. like evagrius of pontus in the east, cassian systematized and popularized eastern asceticism in the west. his ascetic writings made a considerable influence on the development of western ascetic tradition. in this works, cassian managed to combine the experience of eastern christian and western christian asceticism in the era of its development and establishment in the later 4th – early 5th century. his teaching about the order of monastic life, ascetic work and mystical contemplation gained him enduring glory in subsequent centuries[2]. cassian is the author of two fundamental works which have long become the classics of christian ascetical literature translated into many languages: “on the institutes of coenobitic life” (de institutis coenobiorum, в xii volumes)[3] and ‘the conferences’ (collationes)[4]. they were written in circa 420-427[5] in south gaul, presumably in marcel, where st. john became abbot of a monastery to

preparing for the final event horizon of death % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) a black hole in space with its center of convergence is similar to the center of convergence or singularity deepest within ourselves. black holes in space are in stark reality reminders of another stage of consciousness deepest within ourselves as experienced in the near and after death experience. they are not meant to be feared but instead to be celebrated as the ultimate event horizon leading from the chaos of ego consciousness to the singularity of a unified field of love and soul consciousness that exists not only beyond time and space but also beneath our deepest fears: allen l roland, phd “your spiritual heart imbibes in the primordial light and, as you dance towards infinity, you begin to see all things are held together by the power of love.” earthschool harmony , back to grace as a heart centered spiritual consultant, most of my consulting these days has been transmutation counseling. transmutation is defined as the act of changing or the state of being changed into another form ~ and in this case from human to spiritual through love and gratefulness for in reality, on this planet, we are all in essence spiritual beings learning how to be human. to make this great transition we must conquer fear for our greatest fear, which we will come face to face with at the final event horizon of death, is the joy and bliss of knowing that we are all unconditionally loved and have been

Article 1 - moving from paralyzing doubt to rock solid assurance
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse every christian i know has struggled, at some point, to feel certain of his or her salvation — including me. we have all walked through a season where terrifying doubt has assailed the blessed assurance we once possessed about our spiritual state. for some of us, ""season of doubt"" isn't strong enough terminology to describe our experience — we've continually questioned the legitimacy of our faith since the moment we began to follow jesus! i think it's biblically safe to say that god wants his children to know they have eternal life (1 john 5:13). he didn't go through all of the trouble of becoming human, suffering his own wrath for our sin, dying, and resurrecting, just so that those for whom he did these things could spend their lives anxiously wondering whether or not they are really his. god is a father to his people, and he wants them to know that they are secure in his love. but how are we to know? how can we know that we are tightly and irreversibly tethered to jesus by the saving love of god? how can we be assured that we have actually been born again and will persevere to the end? the answer to that question varies greatly, depending on whom you ask. if you run in baptist circles, you may be encouraged to remember the day you walked down the aisle and

Article 2 - lost in jerusalem
the old city itself, however, turned out to be, at least in terms of geography and architecture , exactly the kind of place where i feel comfortable. within those 40-foot-high walls was the dense warren i’d expected, laid out with seemingly no sense of order — or perhaps an order i couldn’t yet perceive. either way, it was a visceral pleasure to master its paths, to dart down the covered, crowded market streets, past the char-grilled lamb-kebab shop (name? “kebab shop,” said its chef) and then up the easily missed stairs off habad street to the empty roofs above the market itself, where the noise of commerce barely filtered through. i loved the feeling of worn stones slipping under my sneakers, and the astringent smell of herbs as i passed palestinian women selling bundles of sage near damascus gate. the boundary between the modern and the medieval was shaky here. cybercafes were ensconced in cavelike nooks; market stalls sold plush rams, lions and donkeys (actually donkey, from “shrek” ); israeli soldiers lurked with their machine guns inside ancient fortified gates. and just as fluid — to me, if not to residents — were the lines between neighborhoods. i’d turn a corner and suddenly find myself in the new construction of the jewish quarter, where informational plaques spelled out the history of rebuilt synagogues. another corner, and i’d wind up in the too

Article 4 - beliefs; as the generations reflect, reconciling the helplessness and the humanity of the baby jesus.
the upper half of the panel portrays the procession of the wise men and their entourages -- in slightly smaller scale since they are still at a distance. two dozen turbaned and ornately garbed figures and 10 horses, overlapped and interlaced, converge on the center of the panel. mary stands almost exactly on that line dividing the panel vertically. joseph, with his palms raised in praise, stands to her left (the viewer's right) and turns toward her. his gaze directs the eye to her hands folded in prayer. the riot of multicolored dignitaries above, the rustic shepherds in movement to one side, the static rows of angels on the other, and the serenity of mary and joseph within the arch of the cave -- it is a wonderful composition. but where is jesus? at the cathedral, several people admiring the triptych were heard puzzling over that question. when one viewer, further along in the exhibition, was asked about the triptych, he exclaimed, ''but there was no nativity!'' and then went back to look again. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later

Article 5 - paperback row
the end of poverty: economic possibilities for our time, by jeffrey d. sachs. (penguin, $16.) sachs makes a bold declaration: if wealthy countries increased their combined foreign aid budgets to between $135 billion and $195 billion for the next decade, that money could eliminate extreme global poverty by 2025. too many countries, he argues, are caught in a ''poverty trap,'' a combination of poor geography, poor infrastructure and poor health care. sachs, the director of the earth institute at columbia university and a special adviser on global poverty to the united nations secretary general, kofi annan, also recounts his experiences as an adviser to distressed and developing nations, including bolivia, poland and russia. windows on the world, by fr?ric beigbeder. translated by frank wynne. (miramax/hyperion, $13.95.) this strangely moving novel alternates between the diarylike ruminations of ''beigbeder'' -- a shiftless, self-impressed intellectual who feels impelled to write about 9/11 -- and an account of the death of a father and his two boys who were breakfasting at windows on the world, the restaurant atop the world trade center's north tower. in the company of cheerful ladies, by alexander mccall smith.

Article 6 - faith healing
this is a daring and urgent book, written after the author learned he had a rare, incurable and unpredictable cancer. but it is not a conventional memoir of illness and treatment. beyond informing us that he received his dire news in a “curt voice mail message,” christian wiman says very little about his experience of the medical world. he is after bigger game. more than any other contemporary book i know, “my bright abyss” reveals what it can mean to experience st. benedict’s admonition to keep death daily before your eyes. as a poet, wiman is more likely to quote a poet than a saint, and the many citations here — from sources as diverse as a. r. ammons, robert browning, paul celan, george herbert, eugenio montale, osip mandelstam, rainer maria rilke, richard wilbur and william wordsworth — offer a rich encounter with literature. but this book is much more than that, and wiman is relentless in his probing of how life feels when one is up against death. in his desire to “speak more clearly what it is that i believe,” he recounts how, after long wandering, he sought to reclaim his religious faith. he understands that he is not recapturing the faith he had as a child, noting that “if you believe at 50 what you believed at 15, then you have not lived — or have denied the

Article 7 - 'queering john wesley'
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse mark tooley is the president of the institute on religion and democracy (ird). on march 3-4 i attended the wesleyan theological society's annual meeting, featuring scores of distinguished scholars, and gathered this year at asbury seminary in wilmore, kentucky. it was a wonderful experience that highlighted the ongoing vitality of orthodox wesleyan thought. here is my generalizing observation. the more conservative and adamantly orthodox scholars tended to be united methodists who have reacted against their denomination's historic liberalism by more strongly affirming classical wesleyan distinctives. the more liberal scholars often tended to come from historically more conservative evangelical denominations against which they reacted by pressing theological boundaries, sometimes provocatively. the most provocative example was a paper presented in a breakout session called ""queering wesley, queering the church: toward an ecclesial circumcision of the heart."" the author, keegan osinski, describes herself on twitter as the ""church of the nazarene's worst nightmare."" her denomination is an historically conservative church from the wesleyan holiness tradition, which in the late 19th century broke from mainstream methodism's perceived worldliness to pursue a more stringent version of christian life. further self-identified as a ""budding librarian and theologian,"" she is a graduate student at vanderbilt university, which was originally method

evangelist nick vujicic has traveled the world sharing his message of hope in god and overcoming difficulties – he was born without arms and legs. in his new book, unstoppable: the incredible power of faith in action, he reveals how he has survived the most difficult periods of his life, and today been blessed with a joyful married life. ""i actually like this book a little bit better, because it's deeper and more transparent i think. i share about the depression i went through in 2010, and share that basically 'unstoppable' doesn't mean bullet proof. when you can't walk, god's going to carry you,"" vujicic shared in a phone interview with the christian post. his first book, life without limits, also sponsored by his own nonprofit organization, life without limbs, touches on the many hardships he has had to go through in life dealing with his rare condition. unstoppable, however, also shares the story of how he met his wife, kanae, with whom he is now expecting his first child. ""with me, in my life, i know that there are people who can get encouraged to see how god can use a man without arms and legs to be his hands and feet, but i wanted people to know that i am not a superhero, it is not about me, or how well i speak or articulate – it is the spirit of god. it is an active relationship with him,"" vujicic told cp.

Article 1 - seeking to save the planet, with a thesaurus
washington  the problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is “global warming.” the term turns people off, fostering images of shaggy-haired liberals, economic sacrifice and complex scientific disputes, according to extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by ecoamerica, a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in washington. instead of grim warnings about global warming, the firm advises, talk about “our deteriorating atmosphere.” drop discussions of carbon dioxide and bring up “moving away from the dirty fuels of the past.” don’t confuse people with cap and trade; use terms like “cap and cash back” or “pollution reduction refund.” ecoamerica has been conducting research for the last several years to find new ways to frame environmental issues and so build public support for climate change legislation and other initiatives. a summary of the group’s latest findings and recommendations was accidentally sent by e-mail to a number of news organizations by someone who sat in this week on a briefing intended for government officials and environmental leaders. asked about the summary, ecoamerica’s president and founder, robert m. perkowitz, requested that it not be reported until the formal release of the firm’s full paper later this month, but acknowledged that its wide distribution now made compliance with his request unlikely. the research directly parallels marketing studies conducted by oil companies, utilities and coal mining concerns that are trying to “green” their images with consumers and sway public policy. environmental issues consistently rate near the bottom of public worry, according

Article 2 - markets right now: us bond yields rise after trump win
frankfurt, germany (ap) — the latest on financial markets following the election of donald trump as the next president of the united states (all times local): 2:55 p.m. u.s. bond yields have risen strongly in the wake of trump's victory, a sign that investors think the outlook for the u.s. economy remains positive. the yield, or interest rate, on the u.s.'s ten-year bonds is up 0.08 percentage point at 1.948 percent. that has helped the dollar recover its poise following earlier losses when trump's victory became increasingly likely. the euro, for example, is now basically flat on the day at $1.1025. kathleen brooks, a research director at city index in london, thinks the rise in the yield may represent some optimism over the u.s. economic outlook given republican control of both the white house and congress. that clarity in government, she said, could aid growth. however, she warns that there could be problems ahead if yields continue to rise over the coming days and weeks. if they do, she says ""concern may grow that bonds are selling off due to fears of america's creditworthiness under a president trump."" ___ 2:30 p.m. investors are bracing for a rough day for some health care stocks after the republican victories in tuesday's elections. mizuho securities analyst sheryl skolnick says the trump win and looming gop

Article 3 - citigroup's chairman is barred from direct talks with analysts
such a close interaction with an analyst is unusual and might open mr. weill and other citigroup executives to future claims by regulators that they failed to supervise mr. grubman, legal experts say -- even though mr. grubman never reported directly to mr. weill. ''the at&t matter could be pertinent in a failure-to-supervise case, given the interaction between mr. weill and mr. grubman,'' said robert g. heim, a former securities and exchange commission lawyer now at meyers & heim. ''if mr. weill was aware that mr. grubman was basing his recommendations on investment banking considerations, that may make mr. weill vulnerable.'' regulators say that a failure-to-supervise complaint is unlikely to be brought solely on the at&t episode. they do say, though, that it could be used as a relevant example in proving a broader case that mr. weill and other senior executives failed, individually, to adequately supervise mr. grubman. citigroup lawyers contend that mr. weill thought all along that mr. grubman was simply doing his job, as an objective and well-regarded industry analyst, in reassessing at&t's performance and that he did not allow citigroup's relationship with the company to influence his thinking. ''based upon my knowledge of the record, in the unanimous determination of all regulators, it is unimaginable to me that any supervisory case be brought against mr. weill on at&t

Article 4 - welcome back, wall street. now pay us back.
it’s been a rough eight years in exile for the big banks. barely three months into the job, president obama told the chief executives of the nation’s most powerful banks that his administration was the only thing standing “between you and the pitchforks.” later he said he did not get elected to help out “a bunch of fat-cat bankers.” there were well-deserved public floggings of bankers in congress and in front of the financial crisis inquiry commission. and in july 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank law, a complex set of rules governing what bankers and traders could do to make money and the risks they could take, intended to prevent another financial crisis. dodd-frank and other financial regulations adopted around the same time have made it much harder for wall street to do what it does best: provide much-needed capital to businesses that want it. they are often cited, correctly, as a big culprit behind what lawrence summers, the harvard economist and former treasury secretary, refers to as “secular stagnation,” an economy that is “stuck in neutral” and condemned to a mere 2 percent annual gross domestic product growth rate. meanwhile, mr. obama’s justice department forced the big firms — or more accurately their shareholders — to cough up more than $200 billion in fines as punishment for, among other things, the role the banks played in knowingly packaging shoddy mortgages into securities and then passing them off as aaa-rated

Article 5 - whoever wins, vote in mexico will be fateful
''the weight of the past has sometimes been more present than the present itself,'' the author enrique krauze once wrote of mexicans' singular preoccupation with history's legacy, the crucible of conquest and colonialism, reform and revolution that forged their modern outlook. that seemed true during much of the campaign, as the major candidates and their supporters restaged mexico's battles and betrayals. yet at the end of the grand debate, all mexico seemed to grasp the momentous nature of the choice at hand. ''this election is the culmination of struggles, initiatives and sacrifices stretching throughout our entire history,'' porfirio munoz ledo, who ended his candidacy in june to endorse mr. fox, thundered last week. ''never, since we became an independent nation, has power passed peacefully from one party to another through elections. this vote is a watershed.'' in the balloting, voters will elect a president for a six-year term, 500 congressional deputies, 128 senators, two state governors and the mayor of mexico city. in a final opinion poll published by the newspaper reforma on june 22, the governing party candidate, francisco labastida ochoa, was favored by 42 percent of voters, mr. fox of the center-right national action party by 39 percent, and cuauhtemoc cardenas solorzano, a leftist candidate, by 16 percent. the margin of error was 3 percent. those results showed how mexico

Article 7 - taking a corporate approach to remaking education
''i've never led a revolution before,'' mr. forstmann said. ''but i didn't get here without understanding supply and demand. parents believe the public school government monopoly produces a bad product at a high price. so why are no suppliers rushing forward to cater to them?'' mr. walton, whose family grew wealthy building wal-mart stores in suburbs and rural areas starved for competitively priced goods, argues that when stores do not go into the inner city, it is because the residents lack the buying power to allow the stores to be profitable. but if inner-city parents were given the option of sending their children to a private school with the money that would otherwise go to the local public school, they would have buying power equal to that of suburban parents, mr. walton said. today, the three men will gather with politicians, educators and investors at a conference in manhattan to try to stimulate investment in education. the conference is sponsored by merrill lynch and the children's scholarship fund, the organization co-founded by mr. forstmann and mr. walton, which this year began distributing $200 million in partial private-school scholarships to 40,000 children around the country. clearly some of the interests of these new participants in education lie in profits and politics. mr. doerr, for example, invests heavily in for-profit educational ventures through the new schools venture fund. mr. walton is active in conservative politics, and mr. doerr

The FAKE NEWS SUMMARY seems to be more general and does not provide any concrete information about the article's content.","**Summary**

The articles present various perspectives on different topics. Some stories report on factual events or issues, while others express opinions or alternative viewpoints.

Key themes include:

- Elections and politics (Article 6)
- Economic policies and statements by public figures (Article 7)
- Social commentary and criticism of certain ideologies (Articles 8 and 1)
- Alternative perspectives on various topics (Articles 2, 3, and 5)

The articles often cite unnamed sources or express subjective opinions. However, some stories appear to be based on verifiable facts.

**Classification Criteria**

To determine the reliability of new articles, consider the following factors:

- Presence of specific details and evidence
- Credibility of sources cited
- Objectivity and balance in presentation
- Avoidance of sensationalism or emotional appeals

Another article explores the concept of whodunits within whodunits, discussing how authors like Anthony Horowitz use misdirection to create suspenseful stories. Horowitz's own writing process involves pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas.

A notable author, J. California Cooper, has passed away at 82. Her work often incorporates themes of family, identity, and social justice, reflecting her Christian values.

In Germany, a trial has exposed the far-right grip in society, with suspects linked to an online chat room promoting right-wing ideologies. The case highlights the challenges of tracking anti-immigrant attacks due to the country's federal system.

A science reporter discusses potential breakthroughs in energy production, including fusion power and gradual improvements in efficiency. However, he notes that significant hurdles remain before these technologies become practical solutions.

An article about fact-checking raises questions about the effectiveness of labeling false news articles on social media platforms like Facebook. Research suggests that labels may not be enough to counter the effects of exposure to false information.

A writer reflects on their decision to use a pseudonym, citing concerns about sharing personal experiences and maintaining anonymity. They acknowledge the importance of honesty in writing but also recognize the need for discretion.

Article 1 - why i decided against a career in journalism
to the editor: re “journalism’s misdeeds get a glance in the mirror,” by david carr (the media equation column, july 30): after holding top positions on my college newspaper for the last three years, i recently decided not to pursue a career in journalism. coincidentally, mr. carr’s examination of the public’s lost confidence in the news media shares some of my rationale. while he rightly criticizes the journalists in the phone-hacking scandal, he explains that they succumbed to the pressures of cutthroat competition and ruthless profit motives. in many ways, these journalists reacted to the demands of the consumers of their reporting: a public infatuated with the private lives of celebrities and the sordid details of their gossip, infidelities and failings. readers, too, share some culpability for driving reporters down such a contemptible path, through their continued subscriptions and consumption of those dubious tabloids. perhaps when the media replace supplying the guilty pleasures of their readers with the ethical pursuit of the truth, then journalism will be the right field for me. james r. simmons jr. wantagh, n.y., aug. 1, 2012

Article 2 - anthony horowitz’s whodunit within the whodunit
“i’m not good at magic, but i love it and am always reading about it,” mr. horowitz said as he nodded at a painting of a pile of books on the topic. “do you see the joke? there is a book missing here, and the one above it is levitating. a lot of what constitutes a whodunit, just like a magic trick, is misdirection. it’s not what you have seen, but what you think you have seen.” although he has written two sherlock holmes novels, sanctioned by the conan doyle estate (“moriarty” and “the house of silk”), he said that he had hesitated to write an adult mystery in his own voice. photo “i think i felt that i needed to do something more than just invent a detective, old, young, whatever, with a sidekick, and then a murder and a solution,” he said. “writing for me has always been about pushing the envelope, and i began to think of ways i could use murder mysteries to do other things. i don’t think anyone has done a story within a story, with two interlinked crimes, like this, so i’m pleased.” the plot, he said, was inspired by the fact that arthur conan doyle, who invented sherlock holmes, “the greatest detective ever created,” came to hate his character. “the same was true for fleming and bond,” mr. horowitz said.

Article 3 - j. california cooper, award-winning writer, dies at 82
ms. cooper’s 1991 novel, “family,” one of five she wrote, is narrated by the ghost of a slave woman who committed suicide before the civil war and who follows the lives of her descendants as they mingle and procreate in a new interracial world, marveling at how “from one woman all these different colors and nationalities could come into being.” ms. cooper was clear about the religious values that informed her stories. “i’m a christian,” she told the washington post in 2000. “that’s all i am. if it came down to christianity and writing, i’d let the writing go. god is bigger than a book.” in an interview on npr in 2006, she said, “what i’m basically trying to do is help somebody make some right choices.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. alice walker, in the foreword to ms. cooper’s 1984 collection of stories, “a piece of mine,” wrote: “in its strong folk flavor, cooper’s work reminds us of langston hughes and zora neale hurston. like

Article 4 - trial in firebombing of refugees exposes far-right grip in germany
turning on the taps is unlikely to cause injury or even death, as arson might, but is just as certain to cause hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage and to keep migrants from being moved in. the first arson case to gain attention nationwide occurred in the northern bavarian village of vorra in december 2014, when someone set fire to a renovated shelter that was about to receive 40 refugees. almost a year later, four refugee families moved into the re-renovated property. but no one was ever arrested for the fire. tracking anti-immigrant attacks is difficult, in part because of germany’s splintered federal system. but the amadeu antonio foundation, a respected nongovernment source, compiles lists culled from news media and police reports nationwide. advertisement continue reading the main story during the week of jan. 24, for instance, it found 10 suspected racist or right-wing assaults, including an arson on jan. 25 that damaged two houses intended for 25 asylum seekers in witten, in north rhine-westphalia. the trial of mr. l. and his friends, which is taking place in the city of hanover, has similarly exposed a worrying attraction to far-right ideas. the men were said in court to have been among the members of an online chat room known as swastika garage. photo several witnesses testified that a favorite pastime for the two men was drinking heavily and listening to right-wing rock bands

Article 5 - talk to the times: science reporter henry fountain
these discussions will continue in future weeks with other members of the times staff. any breakthroughs in energy production? q. is there some major breakthrough on the horizon which can make a majordifference in the search to reduce the overall part of fossil fuels in the global energy economy? a. dear shalom: thanks for the question. the biggest possible breakthrough in energy production that is on the horizon, i guess, would be fusion power — using the heat released by fusing atomic nuclei to create steam to turn turbines to generate electricity. but fusion power has been on the horizon for a long time already, and we don't seem to be getting much closer to it becoming a practical solution to the world's energy problems. one significant hurdle is figuring out how to contain the energy released so that it can be controlled. fusion reactions (like those in the sun or in a hydrogen bomb) generate temperatures on the order of millions of degrees centigrade. so rather than fusion, i think we're more likely to see continual, gradual improvements in the efficiency of other forms of energy — photovoltaic cells that are able to make use of more of the energy in sunlight, for example, or wind turbines that produce more watts for a given wind speed. the ""smart grid"" idea being talked about these days is really all about efficiency — getting power where it's needed, when it's needed, and not wasting a lot of resources producing powerthat isn't used. conflict over climate change q. i

Article 6 - and that’s a fact
to the editor: i would like to have known jennifer b. mcdonald’s take on whether “the lifespan of a fact,” by john d’agata and jim fingal (feb. 26), is a factual work of nonfiction or a ­borgesian hoax. who but a character in a ­borges story spends five (or seven) years diligently fact-checking one 15-page article? did fingal start the process in 2003 or 2005? given that the trail of evidence is there, this fact should be as plain as the difference between purple and pink; perhaps “or” made for a better rhythm . . . or offers us a clue to what’s going on. while i could be wrong, and d’agata might be the misanthropic bully he presents to the world in these exchanges, and fingal the knight-errant, my guess is that they are a couple of clever guys, adhering to the strict rules of conceptual art — or of presidential primaries. p. g. nelson pawtucket, r.i. • to the editor: i was so pleased to see jennifer b. mcdonald take on and take a stand on one of the big issues in contemporary writing, the mixed-up, messed-up mash-up between truth and fiction. the potential for serious damage grows as this approach creeps out from memoir (where maybe you’re sort of entitled to lie about yourself, if not anyone else

Article 8 - why the fact-checking at facebook needs to be checked
since the 2016 presidential campaign, facebook has taken a number of actions to prevent the continued distribution of false news articles on its platform, most notably by labeling articles rated as false or misleading by fact checkers as “disputed.” but how effective are these measures? to date, facebook has offered little information to the public other than a recent email to fact checkers asserting that labeled articles receive 80 percent fewer impressions. but more data is necessary to determine the success of these efforts. research (including my own) suggests the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of facebook’s interventions. yale’s gordon pennycook and david rand offer two principal warnings. first, the effects of exposure to false information are not easily countered by labeling, as they find in a paper they wrote with tyrone d. cannon. false information we have previously encountered feels more familiar, producing a feeling of fluency that causes us to rate it as more accurate than information we have not seen before. this effect persists even when facebook-style warnings label a headline “disputed.” we should be cautious about assuming that labels tagging articles as false are enough to prevent misinformation on social media from affecting people’s beliefs. photo in a second paper, mr. pennycook and mr. rand find that the presence of “disputed” labels causes study participants to rate unlabeled false stories as slightly more accurate — an “implied truth” effect. if facebook is seen as taking responsibility for the accuracy of information in its news feed through

The content of the article appears to be focused on demographic shifts and their impact on society, which is entirely different from the claims made in the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY. There are no contradictions between the article and facts mentioned in the summary, as none exist. The article does not contain claims that are supported by the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY, as it presents a completely unrelated topic.","A series of articles discuss the concept of Agenda 21, a supposed global plan aimed at controlling population growth and promoting sustainability. The plan allegedly involves measures such as destroying private land ownership, rationing resources, and achieving social justice.

According to these articles, the ultimate goal of Agenda 21 is to address overpopulation, which is believed to be the root cause of various economic, social, and environmental problems. Proponents of this plan claim that it will lead to a reduction in human population numbers, ultimately saving the planet from destruction.

However, critics argue that the plan's methods are more sinister, involving forced sterilization, eugenics laws, and other forms of population control. Some articles suggest that the plan is being implemented through various means, including government regulations, public health programs, and even geoengineering.

The articles also mention the involvement of influential individuals and organizations, such as Bill Gates and the Irish government, in promoting this agenda. Additionally, some articles highlight the supposed connections between Agenda 21 and other globalist initiatives, such as depopulation and control using environmental disasters.

Overall, these articles present a complex and multifaceted view of Agenda 21, highlighting both its potential benefits and its alleged sinister intentions.","The population of the United States is aging, with 300 million people aged 10-24 years old. This demographic shift can have a profound effect on any country, depending on how well governments respond to young people's needs and enable them to engage fully in civic and economic affairs.

Marketers are struggling to reach older audiences, as they prioritize younger demographics. However, seniors are increasingly physically active and watching more television. The aging population is also driving changes in fertility rates, with a growing share of working-age men and women and a diminishing share of children.

A new report by the United Nations Population Fund estimates that 1.8 billion people worldwide are aged 10-24 years old, concentrated in poor countries. This shift can lead to a demographic dividend if governments invest in preparing young people for the workforce.

The invisible generation, born between 1929 and 1945, has been overlooked and unexamined despite having celebrated individuals among them. The concept of this generation is puzzling, as it falls between the ""greatest generation"" and the boomer generation.

A recent poll found that young Americans are leaning left, with 28% describing themselves as liberal and 27% as conservative. They are more likely to support gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and universal healthcare.

The world will change after the election, with foreign prognosticators struggling to forecast how a president like Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will affect international relations. The global scenarios and surprising incidents that could arise include the North Korean nuclear threat, Brexit, and Vladimir Putin's designs on the Middle East.

A report by the United Nations highlights the importance of addressing the needs of young people to prevent negative effects on society. Governments must invest in education, healthcare, and jobs to prepare young people for the future.

Article 3 - young americans are leaning left, new poll finds
at a time when democrats have made gains after years in which republicans have dominated washington, young americans appear to lean slightly more to the left than the general population: 28 percent described themselves as liberal, compared with 20 percent of the nation at large. and 27 percent called themselves conservative, compared with 32 percent of the general public. forty-four percent said they believed that same-sex couples should be permitted to get married, compared with 28 percent of the public at large. they are more likely than their elders to support the legalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana. the findings on gay marriage were reminiscent of an exit poll on election day 2004: 41 percent of 18-to-29-year-old voters said gay couples should be permitted to legally marry, according to the exit poll. in the current poll, 62 percent said they would support a universal, government-sponsored national health care insurance program; 47 percent of the general public holds that view. and 30 percent said that “americans should always welcome new immigrants,” while 24 percent of the general public holds that view. their views on abortion mirror those of the public at large: 24 percent said it should not be permitted at all, while 38 percent said it should be made available but with greater restrictions. thirty-seven percent said it should be generally available. in one potential sign of shifting attitudes, respondents, by overwhelming margins, said they believed that the nation was prepared to elect

american intelligence officials are used to forecasting how foreign elections will affect the united states. but whatever would foreign prognosticators make of hillary clinton, donald trump, and the world of november 9 and beyond? we asked some of the smartest spies and analysts we know to turn the tables and imagine they were the national intelligence council dissecting the 2016 election as if the united states were a foreign country. what are the global scenarios or surprising international incidents a president clinton could face—or precipitate? how would america’s role in the world be different from what we’ve seen under president obama? and what happens if donald trump pulls off a win? story continued below on october 25, these four global intelligence specialists—including former nic and cia officials—gathered for a forecasting exercise moderated by politico editor susan glasser. while trump was talking about a “rigged” election and clinton was making a push into red states, the group cast their eyes toward serious international challenges that have largely been ignored on the campaign trail: from the north korean nuclear threat to the future of europe post-brexit, vladimir putin’s designs on the middle east to the collapse of venezuela—and more. here’s the conversation they had, condensed and lightly edited. *** susan glasser: it seems like people are already turning their attention, in many ways, to november 9 and beyond. but everybody feels intuitively that this election is not

Article 5 - global number of youths is highest ever, u.n. reports
united nations — there are more adolescents today than ever before in human history. whether they lift their nations to prosperity — or tear them to shreds — will depend, the united nations warns in a new report, on how swiftly governments can respond to their demands for decent education, health care and jobs. the report, released tuesday by the united nations population fund, estimates that 1.8 billion people worldwide are 10 to 24 years old. the majority is concentrated in the poor countries of the global south, and there are more than 350 million in india alone. india is also among several countries where the shape of the population is changing profoundly: fertility rates are dropping, which means a growing share of working-age men and women and a diminishing share of children to care for. that shift, the report asserts, is “opening a window for a demographic dividend,” but not without significant investments in preparing its young people to join the work force. “the emergence of a large youth population of unprecedented size can have a profound effect on any country,” the report concludes. “whether that effect is positive or negative depends largely on how well governments respond to young people’s needs and enable them to engage fully and meaningfully in civic and economic affairs.” advertisement continue reading the main story the poorest countries face the largest share of young people in large part because women continue to bear many more children than in rich countries. in the 33 poorest countries, for instance, most of them in sub-sah

dominic barton on disruption and leadership 11/25/2016 07:23 am et st. gallen symposium the world's premier opportunity for healthy debates between generations by dennis zhu, member of the st. gallen symposium's global community probably few people on this planet are in a better position than mr. barton to talk about disruption, not only because mckinsey is known for offering advices to clients searching answers for future challenges, but also because of who he is. mr. barton suffered from his personal setbacks of being rejected three times before he could finally become a mckinsey partner in toronto; he orchestrated his own career disruption to move to south korea in 2000 when every mentor of him advised against it; after he took office as the global managing director in 2009, he has to lead mckinsey out of the humiliation of insider trading scandals of its former senior partners with the daunting task of firm-wide culture change. with both authenticity and humility, a rare combination nowadays among leaders, dominic barton shared his view on disruption and leadership. in his view the disruption has always been an integral part of human history and always leads to a better way of life later. the biggest challenge of the current disruptive wave is the fast speed of change, which leaves the society little time to develop a new balanced system to prepare the people with future-oriented skills and to absorb the negative shocks of the change. there

Article 8 - obesity rate for young children plummets 43% in a decade
there was little consensus on why the decline might be happening, but many theories. children now consume fewer calories from sugary beverages than they did in 1999. more women are breast-feeding, which can lead to a healthier range of weight gain for young children. federal researchers have also chronicled a drop in overall calories for children in the past decade, down by 7 percent for boys and 4 percent for girls, but health experts said those declines were too small to make much difference. barry m. popkin, a researcher at the university of north carolina at chapel hill who has tracked american food purchases in a large data project, said families with children had been buying lower-calorie foods over the past decade, a pattern he said was unrelated to the economic downturn. he credited those habits, and changes in the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, for the decline in obesity among young children. the program, which subsidizes food for low-income women, reduced funding for fruit juices, cheese and eggs and increased it for whole fruits and vegetables. another possible explanation is that some combination of state, local and federal policies aimed at reducing obesity is starting to make a difference. michelle obama, the first lady, has led a push to change young children’s eating and exercise habits and 10,000 child care centers across the country have signed on. the news announcement from the c.d.c. included a remark from mrs. obama:

Title: world depopulation
Content: in the news video: there is a movement to depopulate the earth! why is agenda 21 still not a mainstream issue? despite the monumental efforts of people, around the country, to alert citizens, local, state and federal governments and various media outlets to...

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of articles discuss the concept of Agenda 21, a supposed global plan aimed at controlling population growth and promoting sustainability. The plan allegedly involves measures such as destroying private land ownership, rationing resources, and achieving social justice.

According to these articles, the ultimate goal of Agenda 21 is to address overpopulation, which is believed to be the root cause of various economic, social, and environmental problems. Proponents of this plan claim that it will lead to a reduction in human population numbers, ultimately saving the planet from destruction.

However, critics argue that the plan's methods are more sinister, involving forced sterilization, eugenics laws, and other forms of population control. Some articles suggest that the plan is being implemented through various means, including government regulations, public health programs, and even geoengineering.

The articles also mention the involvement of influential individuals and organizations, such as Bill Gates and the Irish government, in promoting this agenda. Additionally, some articles highlight the supposed connections between Agenda 21 and other globalist initiatives, such as depopulation and control using environmental disasters.

Overall, these articles present a complex and multifaceted view of Agenda 21, highlighting both its potential benefits and its alleged sinister intentions.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The population of the United States is aging, with 300 million people aged 10-24 years old. This demographic shift can have a profound effect on any country, depending on how well governments respond to young people's needs and enable them to engage fully in civic and economic affairs.

Marketers are struggling to reach older audiences, as they prioritize younger demographics. However, seniors are increasingly physically active and watching more television. The aging population is also driving changes in fertility rates, with a growing share of working-age men and women and a diminishing share of children.

A new report by the United Nations Population Fund estimates that 1.8 billion people worldwide are aged 10-24 years old, concentrated in poor countries. This shift can lead to a demographic dividend if governments invest in preparing young people for the workforce.

The invisible generation, born between 1929 and 1945, has been overlooked and unexamined despite having celebrated individuals among them. The concept of this generation is puzzling, as it falls between the ""greatest generation"" and the boomer generation.

A recent poll found that young Americans are leaning left, with 28% describing themselves as liberal and 27% as conservative. They are more likely to support gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and universal healthcare.

The world will change after the election, with foreign prognosticators struggling to forecast how a president like Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will affect international relations. The global scenarios and surprising incidents that could arise include the North

trump revives keystone and dakota access pipelines % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) 21st century wire says… tuesday, president donald trump signed an executive action removing legal obstacles holding up the completion of the dakota access and keystone xl pipelines. this story will certainly be a hot button for a lot of people. reactions will likely depend on one’s perspective on trump, understanding of land issues, thoughts on cultural preservation, energy, us jobs, water quality and ecological harmony. with progressive leftwing attacks in full overdrive, post trump’s inauguration, many people are looking to the trump administration to either confirm their worst fears or their greatest hopes, with every move he makes. but remember, trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ is in play now and things may not always be black/white or good/bad, as this administration performs their first set of actions setting the foundation for the next 4-8 years. many following the issue are not taking into consideration that the pipeline is more than 90% complete when obama put a hold on the completion of the dapl via the us army corps of engineers. obama’s move was hardly one of stopping development of this pipeline but was likely politically motivated. it is worth noting that they had previously approved all plans for the completion of the dapl in june of 2016 and appears to have been put a hold on the completion in the

(before it's news) from john sykes we can no longer blame just our political elites, our dc class for our steady decline into immoral statism supported avidly by crony capitalism. the monster is us! we need to do something soon! read the following article please. by george scaggs at americanthinker.com: for many, life in today’s america is becoming ever more unsettling. it’s not only what has been unfolding in washington; the relentless affronts by mr. obama and his administration, the lack of basic accountability in government, the unraveling of our constitution, or the specter of what the numbers tell us about the future of our nation. what is most startling of all is witnessing america’s reaction to these developments, or perhaps more succinctly, the lack of reaction. to behold the nonchalant attitudes and obsessions with all manner of insignificant distractions among the unfazed crowd is an increasingly alarming exercise. it appears, regardless of what comes out of washington, that life goes on unchanged for many americans. when combined with the “spiking of the football” by the acolytes of an almighty, infinitely expanding government, the entire matter is disconcerting, to say the least. rather suddenly, the incremental erosion that has haunted america for decades seems a distant memory. under the obama administration, particularly within the last couple of months, america has now accelerated headlong into the wholesale destruction of constitutional limitations and inalienable rights

“before they exchange blows”: economic facts americans should remember in trump-clinton debate % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) this article was written by michael snyder and originally published at his economic collapse blog. editor’s comment: this debate will be about the epic clash of personalities, and the dramatic fight to the death between the old establishment hacks – epitomized by the corrupt and crumbling hillary – and the swarms of angry americans seeking ‘real change’ through the body politic. hopefully, somewhere in the showdown for democracy, or whatever one wants to bill it, there will be something tangible or even articulately promising about the future of the american people, who have been economically shafted and continuously denied representation in government that gives away everything to the globalist system of domination. if anything good ever comes out of the lousy, phony and empty presidential election dog-and-pony show, it will be something to stop the bleeding. trump’s rhetoric has been built around this, and if he were to deliver, it would be important. hillary waffles lightly on her supposed-opposition to the trans-pacific partnership, and occasional regrets about nafta, despite a solid career of undermining the american working force and facilitation of overseas sell-offs of industry, infrastructure and economic advantage. with the impact of the 2008 collapse, and darker clouds still ahead, this election, past the unforgettable faces of professional

Article 8 - why the trump appeal is so real: d.w. ulsterman
why the trump appeal is so real: d.w. ulsterman (before it's news) by d.w. ulsterman tonight is yet another gop debate. donald trump, as he has done so often before, won’t likely win the debate battle, but he will be just as likely to win the post-debate war. this repeated outcome confused me at first, especially during the last two republican debates that were likely the worst of the worst performances by the new york billionaire. and yet, he followed that up with continued primary race wins, including his very impressive showing this past tuesday that included a thumping victory in michigan. now i think i’m starting to understand this trump appeal and why it’s so real… “let trump be trump.” that is the sign that hangs on the wall at the sparse trump campaign headquarters inside of large and mostly empty office space inside of trump tower in new york. it’s a simple phrase, but profoundly enlightening regarding what is now going on within the current american political climate. when we watch and listen to donald trump, we are getting a man being himself. he’s sometimes loud with a penchant to brag, he repeats a few basic beliefs over and over again, he makes faces when he hears someone else criticizing him, his eyes flare and his chest puffs out when that criticism turns more aggressive, he shows open disdain and dismissiveness toward unfriendly media and much of the long-established political protocols for what a politician should

Article 3 - peter cannavo: the long-term enviornmental impact of our short-term politics
the long-term enviornmental impact of our short-term politics 11/04/2016 01:33 pm et peter cannavo associate professor of government and director of environmental studies, hamilton college thousands of years from now, the scandals, tweets, leaks, tirades, bigotries, insults, violence, sniffles, and stumbles associated with the 2016 election will be long forgotten. however, one barely-mentioned issue from 2016 may still haunt us: climate change. climate change may be humanity's greatest challenge in this century and far beyond. and the temporal scale on which it will play out is dangerously out of sync with the extremely short time horizon that characterizes our politics. the outcome of 2016 for both the white house and congress seems to hinge on the volatilities of the electorate and the churning obsessions of the 24-hour news cycle, including the game-changing announcement by fbi director james comey regarding another batch of clinton emails. november 8th may be decided by a momentarily alignment of the controversies and kerfuffles involving clinton and trump. yet, as david roberts noted, such is the nature of this election that its outcome could reverberate for millennia . the 2015 paris agreement may be our last chance to effectively address climate change. emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases have already committed the planet to destructive climate change for millennia to come . but the impacts are already here, as

Article 6 - a cure for trumpism
in the short term, they might be right: in 2018 and 2020, republican politics might return to an uneasy normalcy. but if trump’s working-class supporters were voting as much for the man as for his message, they were also clearly voting against a party leadership that pays them lip service while ignoring their concerns. some of these concerns are rooted in racial anxiety, and an older generation’s inevitable fear of change. but many of them are rooted in basic human vulnerability — a very personal exposure to stagnant wages, family breakdown, military quagmires (america’s wars are disproportionately fought by volunteers from downscale red america) and a social crisis of opioid abuse and suicide that hardly anyone in washington or new york noticed until recently. these are problems that deserve a political response no matter what racial biases the people experiencing them may harbor. advertisement continue reading the main story keep stringing these voters along with symbolism, and they will eventually seek another trump. so what should the republican party offer them instead? the best answer is a conservative politics that stresses the national interest abroad and national solidarity at home. it should define america’s overseas goals in more achievable terms than the bush-era “freedom agenda” or a hillary clinton-in-libya liberal interventionism; promise support to workers buffeted by globalization; and explicitly weigh questions of community and solidarity when it sets tax rates or immigration levels. begin with foreign policy, where one of trump’s more grotesque innovations has been his praise

u.s. faces a startling new political reality after donald trump’s victory the new york times 8 hrs ago by patrick healy and jeremy w. peters © doug mills/the new york times hillary clinton greeted supporters after delivering her concession speech on wednesday in manhattan. “this is painful, and it will be for a long time,” mrs. clinton said. the american political establishment was reeling from shock on wednesday as leaders in both parties began coming to grips with four years of president donald j. trump in the white house, a once-unimaginable scenario that has now plunged the united states and its allies and adversaries into a period of unprecedented uncertainty about the policies and impact of mr. trump. president obama, a longtime foe of mr. trump, and hillary clinton, the president-elect’s vanquished opponent, held separate news conferences to urge people to put aside whatever bruised feelings and disappointment they have and come together for the sake of the republic, and for the good of mr. trump’s presidency. sign up for the morning briefing newsletter mr. obama, addressing the nation from the rose garden on wednesday, said he had called mr. trump with congratulations and to invite him to meet at the white house on thursday to discuss a smooth transition to the trump administration. “we are all now rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country,” mr. obama said. “the peaceful transfer

Title: editor’s letter: make it new
Content: a little-known fact about the is that it is printed on the weekend before the one on which it is distributed. this means that the contents of this week’s issue were finalized several days before election day. you will find no direct reflections on the results of the voting in these articles. and yet, the uncertainty of the outcome at the time we published them suits the theme of this special issue: our current mania with redesigning, tweaking, optimizing, improving, refreshing and updating everything. in the age of branding, the quadrennial choosing of an american president has come to feel like an exercise in product relaunch, and both candidates — hillary clinton and the eventual victor, donald trump — each represented a new and unprecedented proposal for the face we would show the world. the conviction that things can be eternally improved is fundamental to american democracy. in every election, at every level of government, candidates criticize the incumbent, rail against the status quo and promise that they can do better. a similar zeal has always been a feature of our consumer culture, and in recent years technological advances have only intensified our belief that all things can and should be regularly revolutionized. the spread of silicon valley’s ethos of disruption has emboldened (some might say to a lamentable degree) creative types in all sectors to blow up all the standard operating procedures. in the world of product design, the ease with which any electronic gadget can be turned into a node in a network of information, conspiring to make life easier at every juncture, has led us to imagine a whole new dimension to our most quotidian objects. why sell a mere refrigerator when you can sell a smart refrigerator that adds a line to your grocery list when the milk runs out? in this issue we examine the pros and cons of this redesign mania, charting its path from corporate logos to home furnishings to public spaces to social services and more. we even caught the fever ourselves: working with paola antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at the museum of modern art, we commissioned six designers around the world to reimagine objects that we felt could be improved, from the baggage-claim carousel to the hospital gown to the toilet. no design is ever permanent but merely a way station between what a thing used to be and what it might yet become — a source of consolation, perhaps, if your wished-for presidential redesign did not prevail in this past week’s contest. jake silverstein is editor in chief of the magazine. a version of this article appears in print on november 13, 2016, on page mm22 of the sunday magazine with the headline: make it new. today's paper | subscribe

Article 1 - how planned parenthood could still profit from dead babies
(photo: reuters/gary cameron) planned parenthood federation president cecile richards testifies before the house committee on oversight and government reform on capitol hill in washington september 29, 2015. (via liveactionnews.org) planned parenthood president cecile richards informed the national institutes of health that the abortion giant would no longer ""accept reimbursement"" for baby body parts harvested during and after abortions. while she wrote that one basis of this decision was to ""expose our opponents' false charges about this limited but important work,"" the very decision itself demonstrates that the charge is anything but false. an ""ethical"" organization does not need to change policy if it ""adheres to the highest legal, medical, and ethical standards."" what is there to change? as representative diane black said, in response to richards' letter: ""it is curious that, while planned parenthood officials maintain there has been no wrongdoing, they still find it necessary to change their policy following the recent undercover videos. clearly, this was a decision motivated by optics rather than the organization's conscience. if planned parenthood truly wanted to confront its growing scandal, it would stop aborting more than 327,000 innocent lives each year and fully commit to true women's health care…in light of this news, i suppose doctor mary gatter will have to find another way to get her lamborghini, but rest assured – this development does not change my conviction that planned parenthood

Article 2 - for planned parenthood, trump era starts with worried calls and defiant donations
mara nicholson woke up at 5 a.m. on nov. 9, checked the election results, and burst into tears. she’s been crying ever since and can’t seem to stop. “i’ve never been a political person. i couldn’t tell you if i was registered republican or democrat, or who i voted for beyond the last election,” she said. “but i’m very upset. i have three young kids, i’m worried about them. i’m worried about minorities. women, especially. today, i realized, i’m going to have to get political.” nicholson, 39, lives in san jose and works in silicon valley; 2,500 miles away, 33-year-old kristen goldsmith was having a similar reaction in ashville, n.c. goldsmith had recently received $50 as a birthday present from a friend who, she knew, had once had an abortion. “for me, reproduction rights are very personal,” she said through tears. the morning hillary clinton gave her concession speech, goldsmith donated her birthday gift to planned parenthood. these kind of frantic reactions didn’t just happen because a republican won and a democrat lost. president-elect donald trump has used difficult language to describe various women throughout a brutal campaign—“crazy and very dumb,” “nasty,” “bimbo,” “sad.”he has been heard bragging about grabbing them. yes, the incoming president once called himself “ pro-choice

Article 3 - partisans adopt deceit as a tactic for reports
senator jim demint, republican of south carolina, has limited his comments to calling for an end to federal financing for npr. representative eric cantor of virginia, the republican majority leader, issued a statement saying, “this video clearly highlights the fact that public broadcasting doesn’t need taxpayer funding to thrive.” representative doug lamborn, republican of colorado, also cited the o’keefe video specifically in talking to the daily caller about cutting funding for public broadcasting. “their arrogance and condescension,” he said, is “just amazing.” none of the three mentioned mr. o’keefe by name. when asked about mr. o’keefe’s tactics, a spokeswoman for mr. cantor was circumspect: “congressman cantor has been working to find ways to cut spending so that people can go back to work.” political strategists express worry that this sort activity has been creeping into campaigns for some time now. but the fact that they can so often have a political benefit leaves many torn. “i find the whole thing bordering on unsavory on both sides,” said ari fleischer, a white house press secretary under president george w. bush. “as much as i love it when liberal hypocrisy is exposed,” he added, “do we really want to get to the point where it becomes standard fare — especially in political campaigns — for opponents to engage in sting operations?” photo defensible or not, use of the

Article 4 - cecile richards on her life after planned parenthood
“as a lifetime organizer, i’ve never been more excited, despite this congress and this presidency,” she said in the first interview in which she confirmed and discussed her departure. “there’s this kind of organic activism by women.” her refrain that planned parenthood is apolitical will strike some as laughable. depending on whom you ask, the elegant 60-year-old is a national “hero” or a “deeply evil woman” and “mass murderer.” ms. richards, the elder daughter of ann richards, the former governor of texas who died in 2006, became a household name in 2015, when an anti-abortion group released several secretly recorded videos of abortion providers discussing selling fetal tissue to researchers. ms. richards testified to congressional republicans who wanted to strip the group of its estimated $450 million in annual federal funding. “she has really helped put a face on the position,” said senator patty murray, democrat of washington, adding that ms. richards was “unfazed by the horrendous, awful, negative attacks.” photo on the contrary, ms. richards seemed to relish her role as the consummate rabble-rouser to republicans. she was practically giddy relaying the time she visited a planned parenthood clinic in kenosha, wis., in the district represented by paul d. ryan, the republican speaker of the house. but the work, and her visibility, had a dark side.

Article 6 - justice dept. investigating fetal tissue transfers by planned parenthood and others
the issue has long inflamed the right, but most recently flared up in response to the release in 2015 of a heavily edited video purporting to show a planned parenthood official discussing the illegal sale of fetal parts. that video prompted house republicans to form a select investigative panel that spent 15 months examining fetal tissues sale. the panel produced a 471-page report last december but no charges. on friday, anti-abortion groups welcomed the news that the justice department may have picked up the cause, and they urged congress to cut off federal funding to planned parenthood, a favorite target, in light of the investigation. “march for life welcomes any action taken by the d.o.j. that signals a serious, thorough investigation into planned parenthood’s profitable practice of selling baby body parts,” the group’s president, jeanne mancini, said. “taxpayer funds should not support an organization under federal investigation for such serious matters.” newsletter sign up continue reading the main story get the morning briefing by email what you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox monday through friday. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. dana singiser

the usuryfree eye opener celebrates 2,000,000 visitors % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) by tom j. kennedy just reached the magic number of 2 million visitors to my blog - the usuryfree eye opener in the early morning of saturday, april 26, 2014. though i opened the usuryfree eye opener in 2005, i did not make many postings until 2009. so to reach the first one million readers it took about 5 years. the amazing statistic is that the milestone of 2,000,000 visitors took less than four months and i have not used any seo tools – all readers are by way of referral. i do not know who was the visitor who was number 2,000, 000 but many thanks to the new readers and the regular readers at the usuryfree eye opener . you inspire me to keep researching and sharing information that the mainstream media dismisses as “not newsworthy” and that “formal education neglects to teach.” @ 4:14 am (est) april 26, 2014 pageviews today – 7,081 pageviews yesterday – 13,619 pageviews last month – 379,619 pageviews all time history – 2,000,000 readers come from all over the world. this chart shows the readers for the past 24 hours. countries with less that

Article 2 - midseason report card
midseason report card (before it's news) pretty good season so far. that’s the kind of cutting insight you’ve come to expect, i know. maybe i’m just speechless, because if you’d offered 3-3 before the season began, i’d've taken it.** four wins offers a lot of hope, as does the rest of the acc itself. a lot has gone right to make that happen. the halfway-point bye week is a perfect time to take stock. for no other reason than i feel like it, we’ll do a basic report card and grade the team a to f. small spoiler: nobody gets an f. passing grades for all, which we certainly wouldn’t have said after 12 games last season. **in the sense of trying to maximize our wins, that is. 3-3 actually would’ve been more likely to put us on a path for a middle-of-the-road season, which as we know is really the worst case. either let’s have a really good season or let’s have a coaching change, as you know. quarterbacks grade: b- i’ve been very anti-platoon, for the most part, but truth is, i think this one’s over once greyson lambert is healthy. the reason i have to qualify that is because matt johns hasn’t played like a guy just keeping the seat warm. both these guys are redshirt sophomores, and let’s not get carried away, they’re

Article 3 - the mindblog queue: moral responsibility; evolution of music; booze and hypnosis
the mindblog queue: moral responsibility; evolution of music; booze and hypnosis (before it's news) during this period of relative inactivity for mindblog, while i am pursuing other projects, i still accumulate references to work that looks interesting. rather than letting them disappear into the list of potential posts that has accumulated by now to 50 pages of links, i’m going to post some of the links, with minimal descriptions, to make it possible for readers who find a favorite topic to click their way to the source. did your brain make you do it? neuroscience and moral responsibility. “naïve dualism” is the belief that acts are brought about either by intentions or by the physical laws that govern our brains and that those two types of causes — psychological and biological — are categorically distinct. people are responsible for actions resulting from one but not the other. (in citing neuroscience, the supreme court may have been guilty of naïve dualism: did it really need brain evidence to conclude that adolescents are immature?)…naïve dualism is misguided. “was the cause psychological or biological?” is the wrong question when assigning responsibility for an action. all psychological states are also biological ones. a better question is “how strong was the relation between the cause (whatever it happened to be) and the effect?” if, hypothetically, only 1 percent of people with a brain malfunction (or a history of being abused) commit violence, ordinary considerations about blame would still seem

spencer and laura’s success story: moving to costa rica with two children (before it's news) note: this is a post from joan otto, man vs. debt community manager. read more about joan. if you’ve read some of my previous man vs. debt posts, maybe you know that my background is not in personal finance. i’m a writer, first and foremost, and my experience comes mainly through 13 years as a professional journalist. one of the absolute best parts of journalism for me is that everyone has a story – an experience, a personal philosophy or a unique quality or accomplishment that could help someone else change their way of thinking. with that in mind, one of my goals on man vs. debt is to share more of our community’s stories. i know, baker, courtney and i are hands-down the three most interesting people you’ll ever meet, right? ha. we’re not quite that cool, and our experiences are just that – our experiences. there are more stories to tell. there are more experiences to share. today, i’m kicking off what i hope will be an occasional series of informal interviews with man vs. debt community members by talking with spencer and laura hanson. they blog at lost and found family, and are part of the man vs. debt facebook community, where i originally heard about their amazing lifestyle! they’re also great videographers, so i’ve interspersed some videos of their family

Article 6 - have you been endorsed?
have you been endorsed? (before it's news) if you’ve joined linkedin, chances are good that you’ve been endorsed. chances are also good that you received an email, telling you about an endorsement, and said, “how nice!” followed very quickly by “huh?” of course, you probably know what it means to be endorsed. but if you want to know the how-to’s of linkedin’s endorsement feature, just search “endorsing” in the help tab. i’m not sure how i feel about this new feature for writers. on the one hand, linkedin makes it very easy for your connections to endorse writing skills and expertise. a simple click and look! cathy c. hall’s been endorsed for chicago style. as it happens, i think i have a fairly decent grasp of the chicago manual of style’s editing. and for the most part, i’ve been endorsed by professionals and/or editors who would have knowledge of my expertise. but i’ve also been endorsed by connections with whom i’ve never worked. how would they know about my editing skills? as it also happens, i’m only human. so when i’d see that someone had endorsed me (that’s where the email from linkedin comes in), i’d feel all warm and fuzzy inside and suddenly, click! i found myself endorsing that person back, just to pass along the writing love. until after a few of the endorsements, courtesy of people i didn’t have firsthand professional experience with

Article 8 - u.s. secret service buys 26 devices to identify and collect wireless communication data
u.s. secret service buys 26 devices to identify and collect wireless communication data % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) madison ruppert, contributor activist post an electronics company out of victor, new york has been awarded a $$32,540 contract by the u.s. secret service to provide 26 shielded test enclosures known as “rf [radio frequency] isolation test products” in order to help the secret service identify and collect data from wireless communication devices. the monitoring of wireless communications is nothing new, as we’ve seen the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) pour funds into projects like the so-called f-bomb, a dirt cheap miniature spy computer which can be concealed in just about anything in order to crack wireless networks and steal data. ramsey electronics, the company who received the contract, is slated to deliver the 26 devices by july 1, which is quite interesting because the original solicitation was posted on may 4. if you know government contracts, you know that’s a pretty speedy turnaround, especially since the contract was actually awarded on june 7. the secret service is seeking these rf isolation test products for use on 802.11 a, b and g, which usually means consumer wireless internet networks; bluetooth; rfid and 3g signals. according to the statement posted on the federal business opportunities website, part of the general services administration (gsa) –

3736495.0,fake,reliable,0.9,114.81334090232848,False,"The article and the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY align closely, with both discussing the US Supreme Court's decision on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its implications for taxation and government power. The article mentions specific aspects of the court's ruling, such as the Commerce Clause and the necessary and proper clause, which are also mentioned in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY. Additionally, the article highlights potential limitations on Congress' power imposed by the court's decision, which is consistent with the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY's discussion of the court's ruling on Medicaid expansion. The only discrepancy between the two summaries is the tone and language used to describe the implications of the court's decision, but this does not significantly impact the overall accuracy of the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY.","The US Supreme Court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, under the tax and spend clause. The court rejected the Obama administration's argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress' power to regulate commerce among the states.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the power to regulate commerce presupposes existing commercial activity, not compelled individuals becoming active in commerce. He noted that the individual mandate does not regulate existing commercial activity but rather compels individuals to purchase a product affecting interstate commerce.

The court also upheld the Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA, ruling that it is constitutional but that the federal government's power to terminate states' Medicaid funds is narrowly read.

In other news, a federal district judge in Florida rejected the US motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of the health care reform legislation. The judge found the claim that the individual mandate exceeds Congress' powers under the commerce clause and necessary and proper clause to be at least plausible.

Additionally, a 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling confirmed that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional, directly conflicting with another circuit's ruling. This conflict guarantees that the Supreme Court will take up these cases in the near future.

Market research firm Forrester Research estimates that Americans spent $200 billion on internet retailers in 2011 and forecasted to increase to $327 billion by 2016. The House Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on the Marketplace Fairness Act, which aims to force remote sellers to calculate and collect sales taxes from out-of-state consumers.

A ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts has sparked debate about his true intentions, with some speculating that it may be payback for President Obama's insults towards the Supreme Court.","The US government is considering various tax reforms, including a consumption tax and an estate-tax cut. The proposed consumption tax would shift the focus from income to consumption-based taxation, potentially leading to increased savings and investment. However, critics argue that this approach could be complex and difficult to implement.

Meanwhile, states are competing to attract wealthy individuals by offering favorable trust laws. Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, and Alaska have emerged as leaders in this area, while other states like New Hampshire, Wyoming, Tennessee, and Ohio also offer attractive tax environments.

Cities across the US are implementing soda taxes on sugary drinks, with San Francisco, Oakland, California, Boulder, Colorado, Philadelphia, and Berkeley already having implemented or approved such measures. These taxes aim to discourage consumption of high-calorie beverages and generate revenue for local governments.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the penalty for not buying health insurance can be considered a tax, which could lead to increased taxes on individuals who do not purchase coverage. This decision has sparked debate about the nature of taxation and its impact on individuals.

Regulatory experts warn that the current regulatory framework may not be sufficient to prevent future financial crises. The Obama plan aims to close loopholes in the regulatory net, but critics argue that it does not provide clear guidance on key issues such as capital requirements and consumer protection.

Tax reform advocates, like Hendrickson, believe that the income tax is misapplied and that only government-sourced income should be subject to taxation. However, this view is not widely accepted by experts or policymakers.

In terms of budget planning, the House and Senate have proposed similar funding levels for education initiatives, including Pell grants and a deficit-neutral reserve fund. The differences between the two proposals are relatively modest, with overall discretionary spending varying by only 0.6-1.2 percent.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - supreme court rejects obama’s commerce clause arguments, upholds obamacare anyway under tax and spend clause
(before it's news) chief justice john roberts’ majority decision today upholding the patient protection and affordable care act makes a number of very important points. first, roberts completely rejected the obama administration’s unprecedented argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under congress’ power “to regulate commerce…among the several states.” as roberts wrote: the constitution grants congress the power to “regulate commerce.” art. i, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). the power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. if the power to “regulate” something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the constitution would be superfluous…. our precedent also reflects this understanding. as expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common: they uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.” it is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them…. the individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. it instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce. construing the commerce clause to permit congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. that’s important. when you also count the four dissenters (justices kennedy, scalia, thomas, and alito), a majority of the supreme court refused to

supreme court upholds bill nelson’s massive tax increase & medicare cuts on florida seniors (before it's news) decision sets the stakes for november’s election two years after u.s. senator bill nelson (d-fl) made clear that passing president obama’s massive health care bill would mean “unconscionable” cuts to medicare for florida seniors, the supreme court today has affirmed nelson’s decision to put president obama’s agenda ahead of florida seniors and small businesses. in doing so, the court has made clear what is at stake in november’s election. “the supreme court’s decision makes clear that bill nelson was not telling the truth when he promised that his massive health care bill would not increase taxes on florida families and small businesses. the stakes are now clear in this election – the only way to stop the massive tax increases, government spending, and cuts to medicare contained in obamacare is to replace liberal bill nelson in washington,” national republican senatorial committee (nrsc) spokesman jahan wilcox said today. background…. supreme court affirms bill nelson broke his 2009 promise not to raise taxes individual mandate ‘considered a tax,’ hits middle class families congressional budget office: at least 75% of individual mandate penalties fall on those making less than $$250,000. (“estimated distribution of individual mandate penalties under the patient protection and affordable care act,” congressional budget office & joint committee on taxation, 11/20/09

Article 3 - health care act upheld!
health care act upheld! (before it's news) the entire aca is upheld, with the exception that the federal government’s power to terminate states’ medicaid funds is narrowly read. the deciding vote supporting it was that of c.j. roberts. the individual mandate survives by being deemed a tax. the only effect of not complying with the mandate is that you pay the tax. the court holds that the mandate violates the commerce clause, but that doesn’t matter because there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power. the court holds that the anti-injunction act doesn’t apply because the label “tax” is not controlling. justice ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. her opinion, for herself and sotomayor, breyer and kagan, joins the key section of roberts opinion on that point. she would go further and uphold the mandate under the commerce clause, which roberts wouldn’t. her opinion on commerce does not control. on the medicaid issue, a majority of the court holds that the medicaid expansion is constitutional but that it w/b unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions. the key comment on salvaging the medicaid expansion is this (from roberts): “nothing in our opinion precludes congress from offering funds under the aca to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states

Article 4 - judge roger vinson, striking down obamacare, cites erwin chemerinsky … [darleen click]
(before it's news) … and i don’t believe erwin is pleased at all. page 46/47 of the ruling (pdf) or, as was discussed during oral argument, congress could require that people buy and consume broccoli at regular intervals, not only because the required purchases will positively impact interstate commerce, but also because people who eat healthier tend to be healthier, and are thus more productive and put less of a strain on the health care system. similarly, because virtually no one can be divorced from the transportation market, congress could require that everyone above a certain income threshold buy a general motors automobile — now partially government-owned — because those who do not buy gm cars (or those who buy foreign cars) are adversely impacting commerce and a taxpayer-subsidized business. i pause here to emphasize that the foregoing is not an irrelevant and fanciful “parade of horribles.” rather, these are some of the serious concerns implicated by the individual mandate that are being discussed and debated by legal scholars. for example, in the course of defending the constitutionality of the individual mandate, and responding to the same concerns identified above, often-cited law professor and dean of the university of california irvine school of law erwin chemerinsky has opined that although “what people choose to eat well might be regarded as a personal liberty” (and thus unregulable), “congress could use its commerce power to require people to buy cars.” see reasontv, wheat

Article 5 - fate of sales taxes for online purchases
fate of sales taxes for online purchases (before it's news) as many states struggle to solve the debt problems they created, in large part by their own fiscal irresponsibility and short-sightedness, they are looking ever more covetously at the revenues from online sales that in large part have escaped taxation. these numbers are not insignificant. market research firm forrester research estimates that americans spent $$200 billion with internet retailers in 2011. the firm forecasts that number will increase to $$327 billion by 2016. on july 24 the house judiciary committee will hold hearings on the marketplace fairness act, the first major effort on the federal level to force “remote sellers,” that is internet and catalogue merchants, to calculate and collect sales taxes from out-of-state consumers. the legislation aims to undo the two supreme court decisions that pre-date the internet yet undergird its sales tax-free character, quill vs. north dakota and national bellas hess vs. [illinois] department of revenue. quill and bellas hess were mail-order catalogue merchants. both decisions held that businesses needed to have a “nexus,” or specific physical presence, within a state before it could be forced to collect sales taxes in that state. otherwise, both decisions said, forcing a remote seller to collect sales taxes from customers in tax jurisdictions throughout the country-which today totals 11,000-constitutes an undue burden on interstate commerce, the regulation of which

Article 6 - what was robert’s really thinking?
what was robert’s really thinking? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! editor’s note – the ppaca ruling by scotus, and in the person of chief justice roberts, has come down and people are responding in all directions. many on the right are ready to impeach roberts, while many on the left are dancing, however, upon further review, there may have been method to the madness. roberts may have done exactly what is needed. for one, he gave the romney camp great fuel for his campaign, and reports are showing a massive influx into his coffers is already underway. on the flip side, read this article and make your own judgment…the justices may have ruled, but the battle over obama care is now into phase ii. a phase that may prove to be poison to obama and the ppaca! only time will tell. chief justice roberts is a genius by i. m. citizen before you look to do harm to chief justice roberts or his family, it’s important that you think carefully about the meaning – the true nature — of his ruling on obama-care. the left will shout that they won, that obama-care was upheld and all the rest. let them. it will be a short-lived celebration. here’s what really occurred — payback. yes, payback for obama’s numerous, ill-advised and childish insults directed toward scotus. chief justice roberts actually

Article 7 - the slow road to hell
the slow road to hell (before it's news) on august 12th, the 11th circuit court of appeals in georgia ruled that the obamacare individual mandate is unconstitutional. this ruling directly conflicts with the 6th circuit’s june 29th ruling. the conflict between circuits virtually guarantees that the supreme court will be taking up these cases within the next few months. we should have a ruling from the supreme court on the constitutionality of obamacare by next summer. our plan has not changed: liberty legal foundation will file an amicus brief with the supreme court as soon as the court announces that it’s going to hear any obamacare case. the 11th circuit court’s opinion again confirmed all of liberty legal’s arguments. throughout the opinion the court describes how current “commerce clause precedent” leaves essentially no limits on congressional authority. or, to be more accurate, the court explains that if there are any limits they are undefined, difficult to describe, limited in practical application, and unclear. yet the court fails to identify the real problem. instead it addressed the issue as it was argued by the plaintiffs’ attorneys. it focused on the individual mandate as a new level of congressional power grab. here’s just a little of what the court said about the individual mandate: “every day, americans decide what products to buy, where to invest or save, and how to pay for future contingencies such as their retirement, their children’s education, and their health care.

Article 8 - federal district judge rejects motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of health care reform
federal district judge rejects motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of health care reform (before it's news) judge roger vinson of the northern district of florida became the second judge to reject the united states’ motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of the health care reform legislation. like judge hudson of the eastern district of virginia (and unlike judge steeh of the eastern district of michigan, who granted a motion to dismiss), judge vinson ruled that the claim that the individual mandate exceeds congress’s powers under the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause was at a minimum plausible. pointing to language from the congressional budget office and congressional research service noting the novelty of a congressional requirement by congress that individuals purchase a particular good or service, judge vinson noted: “while the novel and unprecedented nature of the individual mandate does not automatically render it unconstitutional, there is perhaps a presumption that it is. in printz, the supreme court stated several times that an ‘absence of power’ to do something could be inferred because congress had never made an attempt to exercise that power before.” judge vinson also rejected the argument that the mandate with its accompanying penalty should be understood to be a tax and is a permissible exercise of congress’s taxing power, noting that both the president and congress went way out of their way to make sure it was not characterized as a tax. finally judge vinson also ruled that a challenge arguing that the new costs the states would incur under the revisions to

two weeks ago, the senate killed an effort to repeal the federal estate tax on multimillion-dollar fortunes. the ""no"" votes were a stand for budget sanity and basic fairness. but the pro-repeal camp doesn't want to take no for an answer. yesterday, the house of representatives passed an estate-tax cut that is a repeal in everything but name. the so-called compromise would exempt more than 99.5 percent of estates from tax, slash the tax rates on the rest and cost at least $760 billion during its first full decade. of that, $600 billion is the amount the government would have to borrow to make up for lost revenue from the cuts, which would benefit the heirs of america's wealthiest families, like the marses of mars bar and the waltons of wal-mart stores. the remaining $160 billion is the interest on that borrowing, which would be paid by all americans. no lawmaker who voted for the compromise gets any points for moderation. like the earlier full repeal bill, this one is unfair and grounded in intellectual dishonesty. the goal is not to pass good legislation, but to get this top priority for big-shot constituents nailed into law before the november elections produce a legislature that's more responsible on fiscal matters. in an attempt to rally support, house lawmakers have included in the bill another, totally unrelated, tax cut — for timber companies, worth $900 million over the next three years. the measure, based on the theory that american timber companies

Article 2 - a better tax system (assembly instructions included)
tax consumption rather than income almost four centuries ago, the philosopher thomas hobbes suggested that taxes should be based on consumption, not income. income measures a person’s contribution of labor and capital to society’s production of goods and services. consumption measures the quantity of those goods and services he gets to enjoy. hobbes reasoned that because consumption better reflects the benefits a person receives as a member of society, it is the proper basis of taxation. much modern economic theory confirms that conclusion. in standard models, a consumption tax allows the economy to achieve the best allocation of resources over time, whereas an income tax needlessly discourages saving, investment and economic growth. photo moving to a consumption tax might seem to require wholesale reform of our current system. but such a politically difficult step isn’t necessary. in fact, as our tax system has evolved over many years, legislators have come to appreciate the logic of taxing consumption, if only implicitly. the united states now has an income tax, or at least that is what it is called. but because many americans do most of their saving through tax-preferred accounts, such as i.r.a.’s and 401(k) plans, they in effect pay taxes based on how much they consume. tax reform could expand and simplify the availability of such tax-preferred savings accounts. in this way, our progressive income tax could further evolve toward a progressive consumption tax. tax bads rather than goods a good rule of thumb is that when you tax something, you get

Article 3 - states vie to shield the wealth of the 1 percent
yet even as more and more states seek ways to help the richest americans protect their wealth from creditors, divorcing spouses and children, as well as some federal and state tax collectors, critics worry that the effort to attract the lucrative trust business is turning into a competitive game of giveaway. “there is no doubt that many, many jurisdictions are committed to being at the bottom,” said edward mccaffrey, a professor at the university of southern california gould school of law. “i think the real question now is: ‘where is the bottom?’” the federal government leaves it to each state to draw up its own trust laws, and several have tried to go as far as they can without inciting accusations that they are abetting tax evasion or hiding assets, he said. but in pushing the envelope, they can also run into challenges from courts in other states, including the kloibers’ home of kentucky, that have different statutes governing trusts. the clear leaders are nevada, delaware, south dakota and alaska, but other states have also joined the frenzy. new hampshire, wyoming, tennessee and ohio all hope to dip a spoon in the trillion-dollar-plus pot of cream that had traditionally been preserved in offshore tax havens like the cayman islands. over the last decade, for example, new hampshire has passed nearly a dozen laws affecting trusts that expanded their life span, lowered taxes and made it easier to transfer assets

Article 4 - more cities pass soda taxes on sugary drinks
cbs/ap 52 am more cities pass soda taxes on sugary drinks a 32-ounce soda is filled at a mcdonald’s in new york city. mario tama, getty images stumble san francisco -- voters in four u.s. cities approved or appeared likely to approve special taxes on sugary drinks, energizing advocates who say the victories are indicative of growing momentum for measures that discourage people from guzzling calories. the penny-per-ounce taxes in three san francisco bay area cities will apply to energy, sweetened tea and sports drinks, but not to diet sodas or naturally sweetened drinks. on tuesday, measures in san francisco and oakland, california, captured about 60 percent of the vote, with approval higher in neighboring albany. in boulder, colorado, a 2-cent per ounce tax was headed toward victory, although ballots were still being counted on wednesday. “this is a very strong message to the soda industry, and this will lead to the introduction of new proposals all across the country,” said dr. john maa, secretary of the san francisco medical society. the philadelphia city council is expected to vote wednesday on a ""sugar tax"" on soft drinks. the mayor wants to add three cents an ounce to the p... the four cities join berkeley, california , which passed a penny-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks in 2014, and philadelphia , which passed a

Article 5 - justices allow the term 'tax' to embrace 'penalty'
there are lots of taxes that people pay only if they buy something -- sales taxes, taxes on cigarettes and taxes on airline tickets among them. but by calling the penalty for not buying health insurance a tax, the supreme court on thursday effectively created a tax that people will pay only if they do not buy something. that decision led some opponents of the health care law to proclaim that it was a large tax increase, something the sponsors of the bill had explicitly denied when the law was passed. to some extent, calling it a tax does break new ground. ''nobody here can think of an example where you pay a tax if you do not buy something,'' said howard gleckman, a resident fellow at the tax policy center in washington. ''but there are plenty of examples of where you get a tax break for doing something or buying something. in effect, your failure to buy something means you will pay more taxes.'' health insurance, as it happens, has long been one such area. suppose your employer pays you a $90,000 salary and spends $10,000 to buy health insurance for you. all $100,000 is considered a business expense and is therefore a tax deduction for the company, but you will pay income taxes only on the $90,000. if the employer did not buy insurance, but instead paid you the full $100,000, the company's tax bill would be unchanged. but you would pay taxes on the full $100,000, even

Article 6 - heading off the next financial crisis
with that being said, the obama plan has a lot to recommend it. it would close many of the most obvious holes in the regulatory net. congress could conceivably overcome its partisan divisions and pass an important bill this summer. if it does, the biggest reason to be nervous about the plan will not be any one of those details that has received so much attention in recent months. it will be something more fundamental. whatever the regulatory apparatus, it will still be operated by regulators. regulators will have to set capital requirements, decide when to close a struggling firm and find a balance between protecting consumers and still letting them make choices. the legislation does not spell out many of these details, and neither president obama nor ben bernanke , the fed chairman, has been especially clear about them. they have not offered much guiding philosophy beyond promising us that regulators will do better next time. in a way, this issue is more about human nature than about politics. by definition, the next period of financial excess will appear to have recent history on its side. asset prices will have been rising, and whatever new financial instrument that comes along will look as if it is safe. “when things are going well,” paul a. volcker , the former fed chairman, says, “it’s very hard to conduct a disciplined regulation, because everyone’s against you.” sure enough, both bernanke and geithner, along with dozens of other regulators, overlooked many signs of excess over the past decade. one

Article 7 - hell nay, we won’t pay!
there’s one thing, though, that has prevented hendrickson’s complete metamorphosis from mail bomber to soccer dad: his views about the income tax. although he no longer contends that the tax is unconstitutional — a misguided notion, he says, that led to his misguided actions of 19 years ago — he does believe the tax is grossly misapplied. the incomes of most americans, he argues, aren’t legally subject to state or federal income tax. it’s a belief he has spelled out at some length in his book “cracking the code: the fascinating truth about taxation in america.” one part talmudic reading of the tax code, one part populist jeremiad against “a swollen cadre of politically astute private interests and their camp-followers,” the book, which he self-published in 2003, claims to prove that the only income that’s taxable under the law is that which is paid out by the government in salaries, grants, investment dividends and other means. this “truth,” hendrickson argues, is one that the government desperately tries to conceal from its citizens. “americans are trained to be afraid of the subject of the income tax,” he told me as we sat in his living room, a copy of “cracking the code” resting between us on a table. “if you’re afraid of something, you just kind of keep your eyes averted. that’s how the i.r.s. and other beneficiaries of

Article 8 - office of management and budget director peter orszag on house and senate budget plans
with regard to education, in addition to the $100 billion that was in the recovery act, the chairmen's marks in both the house and senate include funding for the proposed increases in pell grants that the president put forward, albeit they do it on the discretionary side rather than the mandatory side. and in addition to that, they create a deficit-neutral reserve fund, which would permit mandatory proposals in the education sphere, including perhaps making the pell grant mandatory. now, clearly there were some adjustments that were made, but let's examine what the adjustments are. with regard to discretionary spending, out of the 18 functional categories in the budget, 13 are exactly the same in the senate; 12 are exactly the same in the house. and even when you incorporate the differences, if you look at overall discretionary spending, the difference relative to the house compared to the president's budget proposal is 0.6 percent, and in the senate it's 1.2 percent. so, again, some differences, but relatively modest. another thing that has been noted is that we had tied the extension of making work pay to revenue from cap and trade. the house and senate budget resolutions do adopt a different approach. i would note with regard to making work pay that we have already in the recovery act gotten two years of that tax credit. so we have two years to figure this out. and as -- as we -- and we have time to figure it out, we are also forming and

Title: seeking the half-full glass
Content: seeking the half-full glass (before it's news) while i am feeling very glum about justice roberts’ decision to uphold the mandate as a tax, there are some bright sides to his decision. as john fund and ilya somin write, by saying that the mandate would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause, the court has put stronger limits on the commerce clause than we’ve seen previously. all those liberals who laughed at that construction of the mandate will now have to consider the new parameters of the clause. if congress wants to expand their powers, they’ll have to admit that they’re taxing people. of course, that means our hopes for limitations on their power will rest on their unwillingness to pass a new tax. todd gaziano of heritage writes that there are two important silver linings in the decisions, although he finds the main decision to read the mandate as a tax as inexplicable. despite the court’s error in reading the individual mandate penalty as a tax, five justices opined that the mandate, standing alone, cannot be justified under the commerce clause or the necessary and proper clause. this is not remarkable to anyone who knows the original meaning of the commerce and necessary and proper powers, but it is a serious blow to 90 percent of the legal academics and about 90 percent of congress, since these have been the clauses used to justify so much of the modern administrative state…. the majority’s ruling on the onerous conditions attached to the medicaid expansion is also helpful in limiting congress’s power to bribe states into submission or to threaten them with the loss of federal revenue in a long-run federal-state program. in a fractured set of opinions that will take some additional time to untangle, a majority of justices imposed limits on congress’s ability to threaten the denial of previous funding streams based on states’ agreeing to new funding conditions in those programs. indeed, seven justices seemed to agree that some constitutional limitations were breached in the medicaid expansion. this itself is a landmark ruling. liberal legal scholars are not going to like most of today’s constitutional rulings; their wailing will start pretty soon. in the long run, today’s constitutional rulings will be seen as an important victory in promoting fidelity to the constitution and the ideal of limited government. the american people and their elected representatives have a lot of work to do to repeal and replace the obamacare statute. moreover, we still have an uphill battle to restore and preserve the written constitution we have been bequeathed, but the court today put some temporary brakes on our republic’s descent down an extra-constitutional slippery slope in which the federal government can control any aspect of our lives that has any imaginable impact on commerce—meaning everything. if you were above all interested in the bill being struck down, it was mostly a loss. on the other hand, if you were more concerned about the qualitative expansion in the power of the government that the bill represented, it was definitely a win.jay cost agrees, now that ob

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The US government is considering various tax reforms, including a consumption tax and an estate-tax cut. The proposed consumption tax would shift the focus from income to consumption-based taxation, potentially leading to increased savings and investment. However, critics argue that this approach could be complex and difficult to implement.

Meanwhile, states are competing to attract wealthy individuals by offering favorable trust laws. Nevada, Delaware, South Dakota, and Alaska have emerged as leaders in this area, while other states like New Hampshire, Wyoming, Tennessee, and Ohio also offer attractive tax environments.

Cities across the US are implementing soda taxes on sugary drinks, with San Francisco, Oakland, California, Boulder, Colorado, Philadelphia, and Berkeley already having implemented or approved such measures. These taxes aim to discourage consumption of high-calorie beverages and generate revenue for local governments.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the penalty for not buying health insurance can be considered a tax, which could lead to increased taxes on individuals who do not purchase coverage. This decision has sparked debate about the nature of taxation and its impact on individuals.

Regulatory experts warn that the current regulatory framework may not be sufficient to prevent future financial crises. The Obama plan aims to close loopholes in the regulatory net, but critics argue that it does not provide clear guidance on key issues such as capital requirements and consumer protection.

Tax reform advocates, like Hendrickson, believe that the income tax is misapplied and that only government-sourced income should be subject to taxation. However, this view

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US Supreme Court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, under the tax and spend clause. The court rejected the Obama administration's argument that the individual mandate was constitutional under Congress' power to regulate commerce among the states.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the power to regulate commerce presupposes existing commercial activity, not compelled individuals becoming active in commerce. He noted that the individual mandate does not regulate existing commercial activity but rather compels individuals to purchase a product affecting interstate commerce.

The court also upheld the Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA, ruling that it is constitutional but that the federal government's power to terminate states' Medicaid funds is narrowly read.

In other news, a federal district judge in Florida rejected the US motion to dismiss a challenge to key provisions of the health care reform legislation. The judge found the claim that the individual mandate exceeds Congress' powers under the commerce clause and necessary and proper clause to be at least plausible.

Additionally, a 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling confirmed that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional, directly conflicting with another circuit's ruling. This conflict guarantees that the Supreme Court will take up these cases in the near future.

Market research firm Forrester Research estimates that Americans spent $200 billion on internet retailers in 2011 and forecasted to increase to $327 billion by 2016.

The FAKE NEWS SUMMARY better captures the essence of the article, mentioning specific details such as the underperformance of gold stocks, the cannibalization by the GLD ETF, and the potential for value propositions to increase. However, it also contains some inaccuracies, such as stating that gold mining is not profitable and that prices plunged, forcing producers to cut spending on mines in half over three years.  The article does contain claims that are supported by the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY, but these claims are not presented in a way that accurately reflects the content of the article. Overall, while the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY captures some key points from the article, it is still an inaccurate representation of the content.","Gold stocks have underperformed significantly this year, with valuations at the bottom of their valuation range. According to Joe Foster, a leading mind in the gold space, miners are more attractive than metals due to lower valuations. Gold mining is not profitable, and prices plunged, forcing producers to cut spending on mines in half over three years.

Historically, bear markets have been opportunities for investors to own tomorrow's superstars at low prices. Brent Cook expects companies like Eldorado Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines to shine when the gold market recovers. The recent sell-off is largely driven by a fear trade, with investors seeking safety in gold.

Gold stocks are being cannibalized by the GLD ETF, which has grown into a behemoth holding $71.5 billion worth of physical gold bullion. Byron King believes the gold bull market will not end soon and advises investors to hold onto physical gold or silver if possible.

In turbulent times, value propositions in gold have increased. Charles Oliver continues to follow a long-term strategy, staying long on gold due to its potential for future growth. The recent price drop is attributed to a stronger US dollar, which lowers the prices of global commodities.

The gold market has been affected by the strengthening US dollar and financial flights to safety, increasing demand for US dollars and treasuries. Analysts believe the euro project has failed, but it will not end in the foreseeable future without European banks, the ECB, and leaders deciding to do so.","Investment strategies and commodity prices are being closely monitored. Oil production in the US is expected to increase due to proven reserves and new drilling techniques, with some analysts predicting a stronger future for the industry. The mobile technology sector is also seen as a longer-term play.

Commodity prices have been rising, with copper prices doubling since January, contributing $2.6 billion to BHP's pretax profit. Demand remains strong despite rising interest rates, particularly in Europe and Japan.

The global economy is facing challenges, including a potential bear market and declining corporate profits. Oil prices are adding pressure on profits, but some analysts believe companies can absorb the costs by lowering their profit margins.

Big oil companies may emerge stronger than ever if crude prices stay above $40 a barrel. The industry has seen a significant pullback in exploration, leading to lower project costs and increased profit margins.

A new US president-elect has pledged to boost the oil and gas sector and bring back coal, which could worsen the global energy glut and reduce prices. This move is expected to have implications for the industry and the economy as a whole.

Overall, the articles suggest that commodity prices are rising, investment strategies are being reassessed, and the global economy is facing challenges.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 5 - gld cannibalizing the hui?
– posted friday, 8 february 2013 | share this article | source: goldseek.com with gold stocks languishing near lows in a desolate sentiment wasteland, investors are wondering why this sector has fallen so deeply out of favor. one theory is capital that would have traditionally flowed into major gold producers has been diverted into the gld gold etf instead. taken to extremes, this logically leads to the conclusion gold stocks will never thrive as long as gld exists. is it cannibalizing the miners? undoubtedly it is, so the real question is to what degree. since gld’s birth in november 2004, it has grown into a wildly successful behemoth holding a staggering $$71.5b worth of physical gold bullion in trust for its shareholders. i suspect the majority of gld purchases have been for diversifying large portfolios, for obtaining that necessary fractional exposure to the gold price. gld is fantastic for that. in a parallel universe where gld had never been conceived, some fraction of the massive capital it has attracted inarguably would have flowed into traditional “gold exposure” for portfolio diversification. and that was buying shares in the world’s biggest and best gold miners, the ones that dominate the leading gold-stock index (hui). thus the thesis that gld is cannibalizing the hui is correct to some extent. but traders have to be careful, as conspiracy theorists tend to extrapolate this theory way too far. despite gld

Article 8 - what’s up with gold mining stocks?
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! by ron hera december 22, 2011 ©2011 hera research, llc claims that the gold bull market has ended are incorrect. one of the main causes of recently lower precious metals prices is the fact that the u.s. dollar has strengthened against the euro. since the u.s. dollar is the world reserve currency, a stronger dollar lowers the u.s. dollar prices of global commodities. also, financial flights to safety, e.g., out of the euro or european sovereign bonds, temporarily increase demand for u.s. dollars and u.s. treasuries, strengthening the u.s. dollar against other currencies and lowering u.s. treasury yields. as the great american author and humorist mark twain famously said in 1887, “the report of my death was an exaggeration.” most analysts believe that the euro project has failed, which is to state the obvious. nonetheless, the euro isn’t dead until european banks, the european central bank (ecb) and european political leaders decide to end it. however, they will not let it end in the foreseeable future. european sovereign defaults, if they were allowed to occur, would not require the european monetary union (emu) to end, although the treaty of maastricht would have to be amended. what is far more important is that there is no way to allow sovereign defaults, or to break up the emu, while

Article 1 - divining a 5-year investment strategy
regardless of whether a correction comes or not, this is where the medium-term projection should have value. instead of reading tea leaves, it should be able to assess tectonic shifts. so now that we’re in 2014, i wanted to consider what investment strategists think the near future could bring. trends some of their views are very broad — like stocks continuing to do well because of solid corporate earnings, low inflation and little pressure to raise wages given how high unemployment remains. but other views are based on stories that could play out for far longer than five years. production of oil and gas in the united states, for one, is expected to be stronger in five years. this is based on proven reserves and new drilling techniques. saying what will happen in six to 12 months in this industry, though, is always difficult: a pipeline could explode, turmoil in the middle east could impact prices, or regulation in washington could cost companies more money. longer term, the issue is supply and demand. “we’ve discovered through this shale drilling how to exploit much more natural gas than we ever thought we could,” said kent croft, chief investment officer of croft leominster. “have all the stocks been the greatest this year? no. do i expect them to outperform over time? i certainly do. i think this is one of those watershed moments in the u.s. economic outlook.” the mobile technology sector is another longer-term play. mr. sass said payment

while 2005 was a banner year for iron ore, with bhp and other leading producers winning a price increase of more than 70 percent from steel mills in china and japan, 2006 is turning out to be the year for copper. prices have doubled since january — less than a year after bhp paid $7 billion to buy another producer, wmc resources, and bolster its copper output by 20 percent. the higher prices for copper contributed $2.6 billion to the company’s pretax profit. bhp said worldwide demand for commodities remained strong despite broadly rising interest rates. growth was particularly robust, mr. goodyear said, in europe and japan. and while china and india are increasing their rates to brake extraordinary growth, he said demand was unlikely to suffer as the industrialization in these countries continued to fuel demand for raw materials. “we think it’s going to be very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle,” the executive said. bhp’s sales to china rose 10 percent, to $6.6 billion, and now represent 16.8 percent of total revenue. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later.

Article 4 - the world is finite, with finite resources
to the editor: in “a terrible bust is born” (column, june 30), roger cohen chronicles many important problems with the united states and the global economy related to increasing commodity prices. but he doesn’t mention the underlying cause of our situation. metaphoric phrases, like “the world is no longer flat, it’s upside-down,” don’t provide an adequate explanation. the basic cause is the literal fact that the world is finite. there is only a finite amount of usable resources. i stress usable, because as we use up the most readily available of our resources, it requires more of our other resources just to find, extract, process and distribute what’s left. matter and energy cannot be destroyed, but the ability to extract useful work from them is destroyed by each of us in our everyday lives. we are fortunate to be alive on a world with such diversity of natural resources. let the recent increase of most commodity prices be a wake-up call that the world is finite. william culver washington, june 30, 2008  to the editor: “a terrible bust is born” is worth keeping and remembering. thanks to roger cohen for his perceptive and pertinent insight into the coming bear market. and thanks for the optimism at the end of his column. hugh gordon nelson, new zealand, july 2, 2008

Article 6 - oil prices raise cost of making range of goods
“our strategy is to raise prices and improve the mix to offset the cost of raw materials,” said keith price, a goodyear spokesman. “no one has predicted how long we can continue to do that.” the sense that many companies may be hitting a wall is palpable. corporate profits peaked last spring and have shrunk since then, moody’s economy.com reports, drawing on commerce department data. the housing crisis and the weakening economy are big reasons, but oil prices are adding greatly to the pressure on profits as retailers fail to pass along higher prices to consumers. that helps to explain why expensive oil has not yet pushed up the inflation rate. so far this year, the nation’s employers have been cutting jobs at an accelerating pace, particularly last month, when the unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent from 5 percent. but with the vise on corporate profits tightening and the price of oil continuing to climb, more dire action, including job cuts and higher prices, may be in store, economists say, although there is still room to avoid such steps. “companies came into this period with extraordinarily high profit margins,” said edward mckelvey, chief domestic economist at goldman sachs, “and some of the surge in raw material costs will be absorbed by lowering those profits.” still, the prevailing attitude that the economy could just keep absorbing higher oil prices is being tested — for the first time in nearly 30 years. adjusted for inflation, a barrel of

Article 7 - after lean years, big oil may emerge stronger than ever
besides being forced to cut its dividend, conocophillips reduced its capital budget for exploration and production by more than $10 billion — or roughly two-thirds. since late 2014, its shares have fallen from over $70 to around $40 recently. but if crude prices can stay above $40 a barrel, the dividends, and stock prices, of the big american oil companies should be secure. and if oil stays above $50, or even hits $60 in the coming months or years, big oil may well emerge from the recent lean years stronger than ever. “whoever survives this is going to win,” said michael rothman, a veteran oil analyst who is president of cornerstone analytics, a new jersey-based research firm. “they’re going to come out smelling like roses.” what is more, the big pullback in exploration has caused a steady drop in the cost of completing those projects that are still underway, as prices for steel, drilling rigs and other services have plunged. that should enable major energy firms to take advantage of economies of scale and increase their profit margins further. “capital spending has come down massively, and majors have taken a lot of the fat out of their organizations,” said neil mehta, who tracks the north american integrated oil and refining industry for goldman sachs. now, after investing tens of billions of dollars, many of these giant projects are set to come online in the next few years, and mr. mehta said he expected big

Title: rick rule & brent cook: gold correction to bring pawnbroker paradise
Content: rick rule & brent cook: gold correction to bring pawnbroker paradise headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the gold report: the performance gap between equities and their underlying commodities has been especially noteworthy with gold. brent, you wrote recently that the gold price has outperformed mid-tier gold mining stocks since 2005, with the price of gold up 190% versus 70%�90% for gold equities. is this because investors can buy gold more easily now, or are some systemic reasons behind the equities’ underperformance? brent cook: several dynamics are involved. certainly one is that you can now buy gold through exchange traded funds (etfs). that is a very simple bet on the gold price that does not carry all the baggage that comes with mining the stuff. that baggage includes the almost universal underestimation of development and mining costs published by mining companies, engineering firms and equity analysts. capital costs are rising sharply due to the basic increase in cement, steel, fuel and everything else that goes into building a mine. production costs are going up for many of the same reasons, plus rising labor costs. qualified and experienced people are hard to come by and overworked. the result is lower-quality engineering studies and misses on cost estimates. additionally, with the higher gold price, companies are mining lower-grade ore, which cuts down on margin per ounce produced. then, we have the almost continual issuance of stock whenever a brokerage firm sees a chance to make a commission. from my dealings with value-oriented funds, this continual dilution from mining companies has been very frustrating and perplexing. given everything i mentioned, it’s not hard to see why the leverage we expected in gold equities at a $1,500 price hasn’t materialized. tgr: so, will we ever see the leverage? bc: now is probably a good time to look at mid- to large-tier companies that have good production profiles at the lower end of the production cash costs and high cash flow per share. tgr: what’s your opinion on that, rick? rick rule: with regard to the juniors, everybody looks to the 1970s as the analogue, when we had that huge parabolic rise. that won’t happen again. we won’t see the circumstances we had in the mid- and late-1970s, when there was a shortage of stock. the industry now has the infrastructure to print paper�stock certificates�faster than demand can ever develop. brent nailed the reasons for the underperformance. people don’t have to invest in gold stocks; they can invest in a gold proxy in the stock market. the underperformance has been disgusting, frankly, and investors are punishing the industry deservedly. the basic product going from $250�$1,500 an ounce without margins going parabolic is truly sick. tgr: given that, why should anyone invest in a junior at this

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Investment strategies and commodity prices are being closely monitored. Oil production in the US is expected to increase due to proven reserves and new drilling techniques, with some analysts predicting a stronger future for the industry. The mobile technology sector is also seen as a longer-term play.

Commodity prices have been rising, with copper prices doubling since January, contributing $2.6 billion to BHP's pretax profit. Demand remains strong despite rising interest rates, particularly in Europe and Japan.

The global economy is facing challenges, including a potential bear market and declining corporate profits. Oil prices are adding pressure on profits, but some analysts believe companies can absorb the costs by lowering their profit margins.

Big oil companies may emerge stronger than ever if crude prices stay above $40 a barrel. The industry has seen a significant pullback in exploration, leading to lower project costs and increased profit margins.

A new US president-elect has pledged to boost the oil and gas sector and bring back coal, which could worsen the global energy glut and reduce prices. This move is expected to have implications for the industry and the economy as a whole.

Overall, the articles suggest that commodity prices are rising, investment strategies are being reassessed, and the global economy is facing challenges.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Gold stocks have underperformed significantly this year, with valuations at the bottom of their valuation range. According to Joe Foster, a leading mind in the gold space, miners are more attractive than metals due to lower valuations. Gold mining is not profitable, and prices plunged, forcing producers to cut spending on mines in half over three years.

Historically, bear markets have been opportunities for investors to own tomorrow's superstars at low prices. Brent Cook expects companies like Eldorado Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines to shine when the gold market recovers. The recent sell-off is largely driven by a fear trade, with investors seeking safety in gold.

Gold stocks are being cannibalized by the GLD ETF, which has grown into a behemoth holding $71.5 billion worth of physical gold bullion. Byron King believes the gold bull market will not end soon and advises investors to hold onto physical gold or silver if possible.

In turbulent times, value propositions in gold have increased. Charles Oliver continues to follow a long-term strategy, staying long on gold due to its potential for future growth. The recent price drop is attributed to a stronger US dollar, which lowers the prices of global commodities.

The gold market has been affected by the strengthening US dollar and financial flights to safety, increasing demand for US dollars and treasuries. Analysts believe the euro project has failed, but it will not end in the foreseeable future without European banks, the ECB, and leaders deciding to do so.

7007514.0,fake,reliable,0.9,121.27180814743042,False,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY because it provides accurate information about NGC 2787, a lenticular galaxy in Ursa Major. The article mentions its size, distance from Earth, and movement away from us, as well as its unique structure and features such as a faint bar, bright nucleus, and dark dust arms. Additionally, the article discusses the role of supermassive black holes in galaxy formation and their relationship with lenticular galaxies.  The FAKE NEWS SUMMARY contains several inaccuracies, including the mention of NGC 1097 (a barred spiral galaxy) instead of NGC 2787, incorrect information about its size and structure, and a lack of specific details about the galaxy's features. The article does not contain claims that are supported by the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY, but rather provides accurate information about lenticular galaxies and their properties.  Overall, the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY is more accurate and comprehensive than the FAKE NEWS SUMMARY, which makes it clear that the article is a reliable source of information.","Galaxies and their properties are studied through observations. NGC 1097, a barred spiral galaxy, has long spindly arms of stars and a strong bar with a secondary bar crossing the nucleus. It contains a supermassive black hole at its center, approximately 100 million times the mass of our sun.

Astronomers observed the nearby large spiral galaxy M81, along with its two brightest neighbors, using the Subaru Telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam Prime-Focus Camera. They discovered that young stars in these galaxies follow the distribution of neutral hydrogen, indicating a hierarchical galaxy assembly process.

The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of gas clouds, including Hubble-V, which is a glowing gas cloud within Barnard's Galaxy (NGC 6822). This region is an intense star-forming area, providing insight into the early universe's star formation processes.

A study found that supermassive black holes in smaller galaxies can quench star formation. Dwarf galaxies outnumber larger systems and are more numerous, making them crucial for understanding galaxy evolution.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an actively producing new stars, with some regions visible to the naked eye. The VLT captured images of two small galaxies, NGC 2014 and NGC 2020, which are part of a cosmic odd couple.

Messier 65, a spiral galaxy in Leo, has a prominent central bulge and tightly wound spiral arms. It is highly inclined to our line of sight and has a relatively recent burst of star formation.

Researchers using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) captured images of a ring of gas and dust surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, as well as a neighboring cluster of extremely luminous young stars.","The Milky Way galaxy cannot be photographed from outside, as it is in a corner of the observable universe. Instead, scientists use models like Messier 74 or Andromeda Galaxy to simulate its structure. A panoramic view of the Milky Way was captured by the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite in 1990.

Astronomers Megan Urry and colleagues have studied the role of black holes in galaxy formation. They organized the Baltimore Charter for Women in Astronomy, which aims to promote women's participation in mainstream astronomical research. The charter also addresses issues like sexual harassment at conferences.

The Hubble Space Telescope captured a photo of a galaxy called NGC 4889, featuring a supermassive black hole about 21 billion times larger than the Sun. This black hole is no longer active and has stopped swallowing stars.

Researchers have proposed the ""Soccer Ball Universe"" theory, which suggests that our universe is finite. A radio map of the baby universe produced by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe shows faint waves and ripples, providing evidence for or against a finite universe.

Astronomers discovered a dwarf galaxy called Segue 2, which may be the smallest in the known universe. This galaxy has only 1,000 stars and is important for understanding dark matter.

The Trifid Nebula was observed in infrared light by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, revealing embryonic stars that will not ignite for tens of thousands of years.

Astronomers watched a supernova and saw multiple images of the explosion due to gravitational lensing. This allowed them to refine measurements of the universe's expansion and map dark matter.

Recent observations failed to detect a predicted light show from a gas cloud colliding with the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. Instead, scientists found that the clouds are part of a stream of gas ripped from a young star about 100 years ago.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

(before it's news) astronomers using the subaru telescope’s hyper suprime-cam prime-focus camera recently observed the nearby large spiral galaxy m81, together with its two brightest neighbors, m82 and ngc3077. the results of their observations are deep, super wide-field images of the galaxies and their populations of young stars. as part of a galactic archaeology study, the team discovered that the spatial distribution of the young stars around these galaxies follows very closely that of their distribution of neutral hydrogen. “this is the first endeavor beyond the local group of galaxies to demonstrate the hierarchical galaxy assembly process on galactic scales,” said team member dr. sakurako okamoto (shanghai astronomical observatory). pseudo-color images from hsc observation which contains m81, m82, and ngc 3077. diameter of the fov is 1.5 degrees. credit: naoj/hsc project cosmological archaeological studies such as this one help astronomers refine their understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. the currently favored cosmological galaxy models are based on the idea of hierarchical structure formation: that structures in the universe such as galaxies develop from small “overdensities” to become large-scale objects. for example, the milky way and m81 first formed as part of a local over-density in the primordial matter distribution – that is, the earliest accumulations of matter in the young universe. they grew over time via the agglomeration of numerous smaller building blocks, some of

Article 5 - cosmic mystery: evidence black holes quench star formation in smaller galaxies
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! scientists have solved a cosmic mystery by finding evidence that supermassive black holes prevent stars forming in some smaller galaxies. these giant black holes are over a million times more massive than the sun and sit in the centre of galaxies sending out powerful winds that quench the star-making process. astronomers previously thought they had no influence on the formation of stars in dwarf galaxies but a new study from the university of portsmouth has proved their role in the process. the results, presented today at a meeting of the american astronomical society, are particularly important because dwarf galaxies (those composed of up to 100 million to several billion stars) are far more numerous than bigger systems and what happens in these is likely to give a more typical picture of the evolution of galaxies. size comparison of a dwarf galaxy (right inset, bottom) with a larger galaxy in the centre. top inset: dwarf galaxy overlain with some of the manga data, revealing the winds from the supermassive black hole. credit: samantha penny (institute of cosmology and gravitation, university of portsmouth) and the sdss collaboration “dwarf galaxies outnumber larger galaxies like the milky way 50 to one,” says lead researcher dr samantha penny, of the university’s institute of cosmology and gravitation. “so if we want to tell the full story of galaxies, we need to understand how dwarf systems work.” in any galaxy stars are born when clouds

this image was taken by the very large telescope (vlt) at eso’s paranal observatory in chile — the best place in the southern hemisphere for astronomical observing. but even without the help of telescopes like the vlt, a glance towards the southern constellation of dorado (the swordfish or dolphinfish [1]) on a clear, dark night reveals a blurry patch which, at first sight, appears to be just like a cloud in the earth’s atmosphere. at least, this may have been explorer ferdinand magellan’s first impression during his famous voyage to the southern hemisphere in 1519. although magellan himself was killed in the philippines before his return, his surviving crew announced the presence of this cloud and its smaller sibling when they returned to europe, and these two small galaxies were later named in magellan’s honour. however, they were undoubtedly seen by both earlier european explorers and observers in the southern hemisphere, although they were never reported. the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is actively producing new stars. some of its star-forming regions can even be seen with the naked eye, for example, the famous tarantula nebula. however, there are other smaller — but no less intriguing — regions that telescopes can reveal in intricate detail. this new vlt image explores an oddly mismatched pair: ngc 2014 and ngc 2020. the pink-tinged cloud on the right, ngc

photo q. when i see a published photograph purporting to be of the entire milky way, i wonder, was it really possible for someone to take it? a. many of the photos illustrating the milky way are actually top or bottom views of other presumably similar galaxies. an earthbound observer cannot stand outside earth’s home galaxy and photograph its overall pinwheel structure, with its spiraling arms and central cluster of stars. earth is in a corner of what humans see as a diffuse nighttime haze of stars. one model often chosen as a stand-in is the galaxy messier 74, because many scientists assume its spiral looks the way the milky way would look if photographed from above or below its plane. another stand-in has been the neighboring andromeda galaxy, or messier 31. a satellite image of the milky way from within the galaxy shows some indications of its structure. a groundbreaking panoramic view was made in 1990 by the cosmic background explorer satellite, capturing near-infrared wavelengths of light in a time exposure. it shows the central bulge of stars as a bright spot placed at the middle of a thin line that represents the sparser collection reaching out in either direction. if this image were wrapped around the viewer, it would be very close to how an edge-on view of a spiral galaxy would appear.

Article 2 - c. megan urry, peering into universe, spots bias on ground
c. megan urry credit christopher capozziello for the new york times c. megan urry is a former president of the american astronomical society and the first woman to head the physics department at yale university. recently inducted to the national academy of sciences , she has published pioneering studies on the role of black holes in the formation of galaxies . more than 20 years ago, dr. urry helped organize 200 scientists who issued the baltimore charter for women in astronomy , which declared that “women should not have to be clones of male astronomers in order to participate in mainstream astronomical research.” more recently, she announced that scientists with a record of sexual harassment would no longer be welcome at the astronomical society’s meetings. we spoke at her new haven, conn., office. a condensed and edited version of the conversation follows. q. why was the meeting ban necessary? a. we had a situation where we had young female astronomers reporting conference experiences that were very different from those of their male counterparts. the men came and used the event to network. the women came and sometimes found themselves worried about people propositioning them. i wanted to make clear what our values are. i said straight out, “look, our meetings are not ‘the dating game.’ this is a professional environment. act professionally.” was there much sexual harassment at astronomy conferences? probably no more than at other corners of academe. it’s a problem all over. i suspect we’re hearing more about astronomy

Article 3 - a black hole that has stopped swallowing stars
the brightest orb in the center of this photograph captured by the hubble space telescope is a galaxy some 300 million light-years away called ngc 4889. at its core rests a supermassive black hole that is about 21 billion times the size of the sun, according to nasa and the european space agency. though you cannot see it in this image because black holes swallow light, nasa said it was one of the largest star devourers ever observed. it dwarfs the black hole that twists at the center of our milky way, which researchers estimate is only four million times the size of the sun. the monster once feasted upon many of its host galaxy’s stars, gas and dust, but is no longer active. the diameter of its event horizon, or the edge of where light is trapped and cannot escape, measured 80 billion miles, and its intense gravitational grasp was capable of heating material to millions of degrees, according to nasa.

Article 4 - cosmic soccer ball? theory already takes sharp kicks
for now, the two groups, who have been in intense communication the last few days, disagree on whether the soccer ball universe has been refuted. what is amazing about this debate, they all agree, is that it will actually be settled soon, underscoring the power of modern data to resolve issues that were once considered almost metaphysical. ''this is what got giordano bruno burned at the stake,'' said dr. max tegmark, a cosmologist at the university of pennsylvania. ''is space infinite or not?'' in nature, dr. weeks and his colleagues write: ''since antiquity, humans have wondered whether our universe is finite or infinite. now, after more than two millennia of speculation, observational data might finally settle this ancient question.'' the other authors are dr. jean-pierre luminet of paris observatory; dr. alain riazueleo of the french atomic energy center cea, in saclay, france; dr. roland lehoucq of the paris observatory and cea; and dr. jean-phillippe uzan of the university of paris. the evidence for and against a finite universe resides in a radio map of the baby universe produced last february by a nasa satellite, the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe. it shows that 400,000 years after the big bang, the event in which space and time emerged, the universe was laced with faint waves and ripples, which are

Article 5 - dwarf galaxy may be answer to predictions
a dim, lightweight galaxy on the outskirts of the milky way may be the smallest in the known universe, astronomers say. known as segue 2, the dwarf galaxy consists of just 1,000 stars held together by a clump of dark matter. (by comparison, the milky way contains at least 100 billion stars.) “finding a galaxy this small is like finding an elephant smaller than a mouse,” said james bullock, a cosmologist at the university of california, irvine, and an author of a paper on segue 2 published in the astrophysical journal. segue 2, first discovered in 2009 as part of the sloan digital sky survey, is important for reasons other than size. advertisement continue reading the main story “for about 15 years, we have been predicting that galaxies like the milky way should be surrounded by thousands and thousands of low-mass clumps of dark matter” like the one at the center of segue 2, dr. bullock said. until now, even the smallest “clumps” detected by scientists were high mass — at least a million times the mass of the sun. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred

Article 6 - a nebula seen in different light
in the visible spectrum, top, the 20-light-year-wide trifid nebula glows pink and blue, with dark arms of dust and gas stretching out from its center. astronomers have now seen the nebula in a different light -- longer wavelength infrared -- and discovered that it is about to give birth to a family of new stars. in the infrared image, bottom, taken by nasa's spitzer space telescope, 30 embryonic stars, including 10 that had been obscured by the dust, appear as points of light. dr. jeonghee rho, the principal investigator, said the future stars were still warming up and would not ignite for tens of thousands of years. kenneth chang photos (photo by national optical astronomy observatory); (photo by nasa jet propulsion laboratory/caltech/dr. jeonghee rho)

Article 7 - astronomers watch a supernova and see reruns
dr. kelly is lead author of a report describing the supernova published on thursday in the journal science. robert kirshner, a supernova expert at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics who was not involved in the work, said: “we’ve seen gravitational lenses before, and we’ve seen supernovae before. we’ve even seen lensed supernovae before. but this multiple image is what we have all been hoping to see.” supernovas are among the most violent and rare events in the universe, occurring perhaps once per century in a typical galaxy. they outshine entire galaxies, spewing elemental particles like oxygen and gold out into space to form the foundations of new worlds, and leaving behind crushed remnants called neutron stars or black holes. because of the galaxy cluster standing between this star and the hubble, “basically, we got to see the supernova four times,” dr. kelly said. and the explosion is expected to appear again in another part of the sky in the next 10 years. timing the delays between its appearances, he explained, will allow astronomers to refine measurements of how fast the universe is expanding and to map the mysterious dark matter that supplies the bulk of the mass and gravitational oomph of the universe. the heavens continue to light candles for albert einstein. on march 14 he would have been 136, and this year marks a century since his greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity that

Article 8 - light show that fizzled
like eager paparazzi, astronomers trained an arsenal of telescopes this spring on the milky way’s crowded center, hoping for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to watch an immense gas cloud collide with the galaxy’s supermassive black hole. the shock generated when the cloud smashed into gas surrounding the black hole, 26,000 light-years from earth, could have produced radio waves, x-rays and a possible brightening of infrared light. but researchers saw nothing. new observations of the cloud, known as g2 — along with a neighboring gas cloud, g1, that passed close to the black hole 13 years ago — have led astronomers to an intriguing explanation for the light show that wasn’t. stefan gillessen of the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics in garching, germany, and his colleagues found that g1 and g2 have identical orbits that lie in the same plane as that of young stars near the milky way’s center. the team suggests that both clouds, along with a gas tail that appears to be trailing g2, are all part of a stream of gas that gravity ripped from the envelope of a young star about 100 years earlier. like rocks carried by a swift current, the clouds may be dense lumps embedded in the moving gas stream. there may be additional lumps in the tail that could serve as future snacks for the black hole, known as sagittarius a*. that interpretation is open for debate. but

Title: anne’s picture of the day: ngc 2787
Content: anne’s picture of the day: ngc 2787 (before it's news) read more at anne’s astronomy news http://annesastronomynews.com/ october 28, 2012 ngc 2787, a lenticular galaxy in ursa major image credit: m. carollo (swiss federal institute of technology, zurich), nasa and the hubble heritage team (stsci/aura) ngc 2787 is a barred lenticular galaxy of about 4500 light-years across, located approximately 24 million light-years away in the constellation ursa major. it is moving away from us at about 696 kilometers per second. lenticular galaxies are lens-shaped galaxies and, like spiral galaxies, they contain a disk, but like elliptical galaxies, they are usually short on dust and gas. they show little or no evidence of the grand spiral arms that occur in their more photogenic cousins. lenticulars are relatively little studied, possibly because of their seemingly benign nature. however, despite ngc 2787′s seemingly bland qualities astronomers did take a look at the center of this galaxy in order to understand what happens in the center and to help determine how lenticular galaxies formed, including the role of galaxy collisions and central black holes. pictures and evidence indicate that lenticulars can be both photogenic and scientifically interesting after all. for example, the above image of ngc 2787. although the galaxy has no appreciable spiral structure or ongoing star formation, this image shows that the center of this lenticular galaxy does have an interesting structure. it contains a faint bar (not apparent in this image) and a bright nucleus, encircled with tightly wound, almost concentric, arms of dark dust. measurements of the speed of gas quite near the center of the galaxy show that it is accelerated to high speed, probably by a supermassive black hole that is quietly consuming small amounts of matter. astronomers study this black hole to learn more about the relationship between supermassive black holes and their parent galaxies. ngc 2787 may be in the latest stages of an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg). there are about a dozen globular clusters hovering around ngc 2787 visible in this image. what appear to be stars are, in fact, gravitationally bound families of hundreds of thousands of ancient stars orbiting the center of the galaxy. this image was made with the hubble space telescope using hubble’s wide field planetary camera 2 in january 1999, by combining light from blue, green and infrared filters. n/a source:

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Galaxies and their properties are studied through observations. NGC 1097, a barred spiral galaxy, has long spindly arms of stars and a strong bar with a secondary bar crossing the nucleus. It contains a supermassive black hole at its center, approximately 100 million times the mass of our sun.

Astronomers observed the nearby large spiral galaxy M81, along with its two brightest neighbors, using the Subaru Telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam Prime-Focus Camera. They discovered that young stars in these galaxies follow the distribution of neutral hydrogen, indicating a hierarchical galaxy assembly process.

The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of gas clouds, including Hubble-V, which is a glowing gas cloud within Barnard's Galaxy (NGC 6822). This region is an intense star-forming area, providing insight into the early universe's star formation processes.

A study found that supermassive black holes in smaller galaxies can quench star formation. Dwarf galaxies outnumber larger systems and are more numerous, making them crucial for understanding galaxy evolution.

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an actively producing new stars, with some regions visible to the naked eye. The VLT captured images of two small galaxies, NGC 2014 and NGC 2020, which are part of a cosmic odd couple.

Messier 65, a spiral galaxy in Leo, has a prominent central bulge and tightly wound spiral arms. It is highly inclined to our line

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
The Milky Way galaxy cannot be photographed from outside, as it is in a corner of the observable universe. Instead, scientists use models like Messier 74 or Andromeda Galaxy to simulate its structure. A panoramic view of the Milky Way was captured by the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite in 1990.

Astronomers Megan Urry and colleagues have studied the role of black holes in galaxy formation. They organized the Baltimore Charter for Women in Astronomy, which aims to promote women's participation in mainstream astronomical research. The charter also addresses issues like sexual harassment at conferences.

The Hubble Space Telescope captured a photo of a galaxy called NGC 4889, featuring a supermassive black hole about 21 billion times larger than the Sun. This black hole is no longer active and has stopped swallowing stars.

Researchers have proposed the ""Soccer Ball Universe"" theory, which suggests that our universe is finite. A radio map of the baby universe produced by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe shows faint waves and ripples, providing evidence for or against a finite universe.

Astronomers discovered a dwarf galaxy called Segue 2, which may be the smallest in the known universe. This galaxy has only 1,000 stars and is important for understanding dark matter.

The Trifid Nebula was observed in infrared light by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, revealing embryonic stars that will not ignite for tens of thousands of years.

The industry's decline is attributed to various factors, including increased competition from foreign manufacturers, rising labor costs, and a lack of investment in research and development.

Italy's Fiat has announced plans to keep its production base in Italy despite threatening to leave for Eastern European countries. The company's CEO, Sergio Marchionne, has advocated for liberalization reforms to boost competitiveness.

Volkswagen AG's settlement with US diesel owners and government regulators is valued at over $15 billion. The settlement includes buybacks and funds to offset excess emissions.

The world's unsold car stockpile is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, with many cars sitting idle due to stagnant demand. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of the automotive industry.

Lentuo Intl (LAS) reported a 14.4% increase in revenues for its third quarter of 2011, but a 76% decrease in net income due to reduced gross margin and increased marketing expenses.

The supply side of the economy is facing challenges, with many countries struggling to sustain their economies and deliver on social commitments. Germany's supply-side policies have been effective in meeting both goals, resulting in low unemployment and a balanced fiscal budget.

The demand for silver is expected to increase due to its use in various industries, including electronics and renewable energy. However, concerns about the supply of refined silver are growing, which could impact prices.

A recent survey found that many people believe that bitcoin and blockchain searches exceed those of Donald Trump, with some even speculating that blockchain stocks will be the next big thing.","European carmakers are facing challenges, with Ford closing three plants in Belgium and Britain to reduce production capacity by 18%. The move is part of a larger restructuring effort, which has seen European auto sales drop sharply. The industry is also struggling with overcapacity, with experts estimating that Europe has at least 25% too much production.

The situation is further complicated by the need to balance job preservation and cost-cutting measures. Fiat, for example, is trying to avoid an initial public offering on its Chrysler stake, which would increase the price it would have to pay.

Meanwhile, Chinese automakers are struggling to meet Western standards in terms of styling, safety, emissions, and performance. Despite their manufacturing prowess, they have not yet been able to produce cars that appeal to Western tastes.

The European car industry is also facing challenges from rising fuel prices and tariffs on imported vehicles. The situation has led some experts to warn of a potential crisis in 10 years' time if hard decisions are not taken now.

In contrast, emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia, and China are expected to drive growth in the automotive industry. Nissan, for example, is planning to take full advantage of this growth by expanding its presence in these regions.

Article 2 - state capitalism or corporatism? italy’s carmaker conundrum
state capitalism or corporatism? italy’s carmaker conundrum (before it's news) italy’s iconic car manufacturer, fiat, announced saturday its plans to keep its production base in italy after months of threatening to leave for more business-friendly and less-regulated eastern european countries. in fact, fiat has already been offshoring — and its polish assembly plants are more than three times as productive than their italian counterparts. ceo sergio marchionne has become a prominent figure in italian media recently, as he has denounced italy’s poor business environment (the second-worst of all oecd high-income countries) and advocated liberalization reform on numerous occasions. as part of fiat’s decision to stay, the italian government agreed to “work together” with fiat to “strengthen the company’s competitiveness.” it is unclear what exactly this entails, but if prime minister mario monti’s administration truly wants to boost the competitiveness of italian firms, he should begin by revisiting his damp squib labor reform package devised this spring and passed in parliament this summer. dismissal of poorly performing employees still remains illegal in italy. and although the reforms now permit layoffs during times of financial distress, employers must prove the economic necessity of the dismissals to a labor judge. as i’ve written in the wall street journal and in the city am, the italian judiciary is neither impartial nor efficient. growing a business and hiring new employees is just too risky in italy. marchionne is

Article 6 - the supply side
the supply side (before it's news) since the housing and mortgage expansion reached its unsustainable zenith nearly five years ago, economic headwinds and financial contraction have been at the forefront of financial market discussions. two years ago, the sovereign debt problems of the developed world further added demand-side challenges (see lacy hunt interview: roadblocks to recovery). over that time economic policy has concentrated on resurrecting demand via government debt-financed spending or monetary expansion. it is safe to say that we have now learned that the keynesian tools that served well in a less debt-challenged environment no longer solves the macroeconomic problem. if it did, we would not be facing the question of yet another qe. moreover, we do not have an answer to the larger question of the sustainability of the western social model of a government-funded retirement with medical care. in the following guest blog, dr. wilfried prewo points out that a decade ago, germany was faced with a similar problem of sustaining the economy and delivering on the government’s social commitments. as a result, she devised supply-side policies that have been very effective in meeting both goals. today, germany has the lowest unit labor cost despite also having the highest wages in europe. as a result, she runs a trade surplus, has relatively low unemployment and a near balanced fiscal budget. the u.s. has a lot to learn from these innovative supply-side policies. germany: export powerhouse despite high wages by dr. wildfried prewo just

Article 1 - opel-peugeot merger faces a winding road
carlos tavares has shown he can quickly turn around troubled european carmakers. within three years of his taking charge at the paris-based psa group, the company’s profit margin has tripled. now mr. tavares may be preparing to take on a new challenge by acquiring general motors’ troubled european unit. combining europe’s third- and sixth-largest makers of passenger cars would be a big step toward ending the gridlock in the continent’s auto industry. despite years of downsizing and a rebound in demand for new vehicles, the industry suffers from overcapacity. peugeot plants operate at around 74 percent of their potential, according to evercore isi analysts. uniting the opel and vauxhall brands with peugeot and citroen would lift psa’s european market share to 16 percent, second only to volkswagen’s 24 percent. bigger companies have better bargaining power with suppliers and are better able to pay rising research and development costs. renault of france and nissan of japan provide a possible road map. the companies, which are both run by carlos ghosn as chief executive and have significant cross-shareholdings, reckon their alliance lowered costs by 4.3 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2015 — equivalent to about 3.5 percent of combined sales. advertisement continue reading the main story if psa and general motors europe achieved similar savings, costs would fall by 1.9 billion euros, based on

Article 2 - ford closing 3 plants in european downsizing
ford’s chief executive, alan r. mulally, said the automaker was working with its unions in belgium and britain to assist workers affected by the factory closings. “we recognize the impact our actions will have on many employees and their families in europe, and we will work together with all stakeholders during this necessary transformation of our business,” he said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. ford had said wednesday that it would close its assembly plant in genk, belgium, by the end of 2014. on thursday, it said it would also close two plants in southampton and dagenham in britain next year. the actions will reduce production capacity in europe by 18 percent, or 355,000 vehicles. the company said it would eliminate 4,300 positions in belgium and 1,400 in britain. the moves contrast with those of other automakers that have either avoided plant closings altogether, or scheduled shutdowns for several years from now. one industry analyst said other auto companies in europe could follow ford’s lead and step up their restructuring efforts. “there is something to be said for swallowing all of the bad medicine at one time,” said michael robinet, managing director of ihs automotive consulting in northville, mich. “i think other manufacturers have to acknowledge a real sense of urgency now.” european auto sales have fallen to a projected 14 million vehicles this year, down from about 18 million in 2008

“the market is pretty saturated right now,” said jessica caldwell, an analyst with edmunds.com. she noted that there were now 1.26 vehicles on the road for every licensed driver, more than ever. the downward sales trend is the latest challenge for the industry. tariffs could be imposed on cars made in mexico and canada if the trump administration negotiates major changes to the north american free trade agreement. manufacturers are also trying to push ahead with self-driving and electric vehicles even as it remains unclear how many they will be able to sell, and when. the effect of rising fuel prices is also a question mark. though still low by the standards of recent years, prices at the pump were $2.49 a gallon for regular gas on wednesday compared with $2.35 a year ago, according to aaa. the seven-year stretch of growth from 2010 to 2016 is the longest since the infancy of the automobile nearly a century ago, according to the automotive publisher wardsauto. it was born out of one of the industry’s darkest periods: the deep recession that prompted federally backed bankruptcy reorganizations of general motors and chrysler. at the low point, 2009, new-car sales plunged to fewer than 11 million a year. as sales climbed over the past seven years, carmakers had to worry little about keeping their plants humming. now they are faced with the prospect of trimming production and finding ways to entice customers to buy the vehicles

Article 4 - not coming soon to a lot near you: chinese cars
still, despite china’s manufacturing prowess, it is, for now, proving a lot harder than automakers here anticipated to make cars that appeal to western tastes. while chinese cars are inexpensive and approaching western levels of reliability, chinese automakers have not yet brought their styling, safety, emissions and performance standards up to snuff, let alone their skill at marketing home-grown nameplates around the globe. in one glaring example last year, a german automobile club tested one of 700 vehicles shipped to europe by a tiny chinese manufacturer of sport utilities. it came up with a result that humiliated the chinese officials who oversee the mostly state-owned chinese car industry: the vehicle, the landwind new vision, got the worst crash rating the club had ever awarded in 20 years of testing. “most of the chinese companies that were preparing for exports have turned cautious, because this is a very difficult job,” said lawrence ang, a board member who oversees international finance at the geely group, a large, publicly traded chinese automaker. chinese subcompact cars from manufacturers like geely and lifan have surprisingly ample headroom, but fall short of western tastes in other areas. the exteriors of chinese cars tend to have simple curves and straight lines that are easy for factories to stamp out of steel, but look starkly utilitarian by western standards. even names like geely (pronounced jee-lee) are unfamiliar. china’s automakers also face rising wages at the same time the country

Article 5 - auto troubles touch many corners: europe feels the strain of protecting workers and plants
sales have dropped sharply in both markets, however, and experts say europe has at least 25 percent too much production capacity. in recent years, car production at new plants in central and eastern europe has surged, but few of the older, more expensive factories in france, belgium or germany have closed. “if they don’t take the pain now the way the u.s. is accepting it, you’re just storing up a crisis in 10 years time,” stuart pearson, an analyst with credit suisse in london, said. for now, however, european workers and politicians prefer to put off any hard decisions. as g.m. lurches toward a likely bankruptcy filing by june 1 and several bidders race to make a deal for opel and the rest of g.m. europe, the goal of preserving jobs, not profits, could determine the winner. along with g.m.’s endorsement, financial aid from the german government will be needed by any of the potential acquirers, which include the italian automaker fiat as well as magna international, a canadian auto parts maker with major operations in europe, and rhj international, a brussels-based private equity firm. “too many players and too much capacity is a recipe for value destruction,” mr. pearson said. the stakes are especially high for fiat, whose chief executive, sergio marchionne, has embraced the american approach and called for consolidation with a few global players dominating the industry. last month

Article 7 - nissan and others add factories in emerging markets
speaking at an annual shareholders meeting on wednesday in yokohama, nissan’s chief executive, carlos ghosn, said that surging prices for raw materials would force car companies to raise prices — but that the economic malaise afflicting the united states and japan would make it harder to increase sales in the face of higher prices. so places with rapidly escalating demand — like india, brazil, russia and china — will be more important than ever. “we intend to take full advantage of growth in emerging markets,” mr. ghosn said. “these developing markets used to be an afterthought” for japanese automakers, said hirofumi yokoi, an analyst in tokyo for csm worldwide, the auto market research company. “now they are the industry’s future.” according to csm, vehicle sales in developing regions are expected to rise by about 10 million units over the next six years, contributing 76 percent of the industry’s entire global growth. in the last seven years, nissan’s vehicle sales in all developing nations have nearly tripled to 1 million units, out of the company’s 3.7 million vehicle sales last year. “it used to be that honda relied on its u.s. business, maybe too heavily,” said honda’s president in india, masahiro takedagawa. “nowadays, we are trying to spread the sources of profits more globally, beyond just one market.” photo to be

ARTICLE TO CLASSIFY
-------------------
Title: europe’s auto industry has reached day of reckoning
Content: huge overcapacity, some auto executives say, has spawned a crisis similar to the one the u.s. industry barely survived just a few years ago. in fact, the downturn in europe threatens the remarkably rapid recoveries that ford and general motors were able to make after detroit’s moment of truth in 2009. underused plants are ruinous for car companies, which must continue to pay upkeep costs and make payroll even as revenue plunges. by some estimates, the european industry as a whole is operating at only about 60 percent to 65 percent of capacity. as a general rule, plants must operate at about 75 percent or 80 percent to be profitable, analysts say. the figures may be much worse for some factories, including fiat plants in italy, analysts said. at the same time, german luxury carmakers like bmw and mercedes continue to thrive and are operating at or near capacity. few business undertakings are more tortuous than closing a european car factory. peugeot braved howls from unions and the new socialist government of françois hollande this month when it said that it would close a plant in aulnay, outside paris, in hopes of stemming losses that reached €819 million, or $993 million, in the first half of this year. closing a plant typically requires a long and costly battle with unions, which have more legal rights than in the united states. german law, for example, requires companies to negotiate job cuts with worker representatives, who can demand large severance payments or pensions. in an effort avoid a confrontation with labor, peugeot has promised to convert its plant in aulnay, which employs 3,000 people, to other, unspecified manufacturing. the company also promised to help employees find new jobs after car production ends in 2014. but such measures add to the cost at a time when peugeot is hemorrhaging money. and the compromises have not prevented political leaders from pushing the company to scale back plans to cut a total of 8,000 jobs in france, or dissuaded workers from protesting outside the company’s paris headquarters on wednesday. photo even after four years of catastrophic sales, only a few of europe’s 100 or so auto plants have shut down. the closures include an opel factory in antwerp and a fiat plant in sicily. advertisement continue reading the main story “it’s a question of who has the stomach for the fight,” said tim urquhart, an analyst at ihs automotive. but with the european car industry on track to suffer its worst year since 1996, more closings seem unavoidable. about 12.4 million vehicles will be sold in the european union this year, according to industry estimates. that is 3 million less than in 2007. the car industry provides one of the most vivid examples of how the euro zone debt crisis is infecting companies outside the financial industry. there are some disturbing parallels.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
European carmakers are facing challenges, with Ford closing three plants in Belgium and Britain to reduce production capacity by 18%. The move is part of a larger restructuring effort, which has seen European auto sales drop sharply. The industry is also struggling with overcapacity, with experts estimating that Europe has at least 25% too much production.

The situation is further complicated by the need to balance job preservation and cost-cutting measures. Fiat, for example, is trying to avoid an initial public offering on its Chrysler stake, which would increase the price it would have to pay.

Meanwhile, Chinese automakers are struggling to meet Western standards in terms of styling, safety, emissions, and performance. Despite their manufacturing prowess, they have not yet been able to produce cars that appeal to Western tastes.

The European car industry is also facing challenges from rising fuel prices and tariffs on imported vehicles. The situation has led some experts to warn of a potential crisis in 10 years' time if hard decisions are not taken now.

In contrast, emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia, and China are expected to drive growth in the automotive industry. Nissan, for example, is planning to take full advantage of this growth by expanding its presence in these regions.

Overall, the European car industry is facing significant challenges, but there are also opportunities for growth in emerging markets.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
The US auto industry has declined significantly, with Japan and Germany now producing more vehicles than the US. The industry's decline is attributed to various factors, including increased competition from foreign manufacturers, rising labor costs, and a lack of investment in research and development.

Italy's Fiat has announced plans to keep its production base in Italy despite threatening to leave for Eastern European countries. The company's CEO, Sergio Marchionne, has advocated for liberalization reforms to boost competitiveness.

Volkswagen AG's settlement with US diesel owners and government regulators is valued at over $15 billion. The settlement includes buybacks and funds to offset excess emissions.

The world's unsold car stockpile is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, with many cars sitting idle due to stagnant demand. This has led to concerns about the sustainability of the automotive industry.

Lentuo Intl (LAS) reported a 14.4% increase in revenues for its third quarter of 2011, but a 76% decrease in net income due to reduced gross margin and increased marketing expenses.

The supply side of the economy is facing challenges, with many countries struggling to sustain their economies and deliver on social commitments. Germany's supply-side policies have been effective in meeting both goals, resulting in low unemployment and a balanced fiscal budget.

The demand for silver is expected to increase due to its use in various industries, including electronics and renewable energy. However, concerns about the supply of refined silver are growing, which could impact prices.

a new revelation in the case of ryan clayton — the protester who managed to make his way into the press area of the capitol to get close to president donald trump — is bad news for the capitol police. fox news reported that clayton was known by capitol police, and they had him on a watch list. it turns out clayton was denied entry earlier on tuesday but managed to go through a tunnel later without having to show his id. the id he did have was an outdated, four-day visitor’s pass. he then got to the senate chamber, where members of the press were waiting and blended in with them. as trump passed by them, clayton threw russian flags and shouted “treason” at him. “this was a monumental f**k up,” a senior congressional security source told fox news. clayton caused a scene on capitol hill in july, when trump’s son-in-law, jared kushner, met with the senate intelligence committee. in that incident, clayton tried to get kushner to sign a russian flag as he left. fox news congressional reporter chad pergram said there will probably be serious consequences for the officers who were present. “some heads will roll,” a source told him. in a press release, capitol police said clayton was only charged with unlawful conduct, a misdemeanor. if he is convicted on the charge, he could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and face a

Article 4 - trump to criminalize filming police shootings if elected: “it’s just an excuse for racist labels”
charlotte, n.c. – the charlotte-mecklenburg police department on saturday released portions of video footage of the police shooting of keith scott. scott was killed by police tuesday in an incident described very differently by police and witnesses. a graphic video released on saturday, taken from police body camera footage of the incident, shows an officer trying to gain access to scott’s vehicle. it captures the moments after scott goes down, but the shooting itself is obscured. reacting to the controversial video of the incident, republican presidential candidate donald trump said in an interview with fox news that the rise in police shootings that has occurred in recent months serves “as an excuse for handing out racist labels,” when in reality, many of the shootings were “pretty justified.” “now, don’t get me wrong – i think the police are making a lot of mistakes, as well,” trump said. “but the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that these videos can be very easily misused to paint the picture of police officers who are killing suspects intentionally, just for the heck of it.” “and that is precisely why i intend to criminalize those body cams that serve against police officers who are wearing them the second i am elected, we can’t have any more of that,” he added. “and here’s a very simple reason why that’s such a good idea. police officers protect citizens and the law because they have a duty and an obligation to do

Article 1 - in trump’s hometown, a clear message of defiance from women
new yorkers flooded the streets of manhattan on saturday aiming to send a message to president trump that his hometown would be a center of resistance during his administration. the mayor’s office estimated that 400,000 people took part in the march, which was in concert with other women’s march rallies across the country. with huge crowds along fifth avenue near trump tower, a large slice of manhattan came to a standstill for much of the day. participants booed mr. trump and hoisted signs mocking both his hair and his relationship with president vladimir v. putin of russia. it was a moment of both catharsis and camaraderie in a city that was, for the most part, shocked and disappointed by mr. trump’s ascendance to the presidency. holding a “nasty woman” sign, grace huezo, 20, was buoyed by the huge turnout and the joyful mood. photo “i’m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they’re keeping their spirit,” she said. “we’re all just going to stick together over the next four years.” advertisement continue reading the main story ms. huezo, a student at hunter college, said she was marching with her sister to defend women’s rights. she said she was appalled by the 2005 recording of mr. trump’s lewd comments about women that emerged during the campaign.

he paused and considered what this city, famous for its gay night life, looks like on most weekends, and particularly during the gay pride celebration. “but that would be consistent with what you might see on santa monica boulevard in west hollywood,” he added. at first, the case of the missing pink dog appeared to have all the hallmarks of a drunken college prank or the antics of a west hollywood denizen who, after a few drinks the day of the parade, thought it would make a particularly distinctive feature for his or her pool. if the dog was returned unharmed, city officials promised to ask no questions. as days have dragged into weeks, however, no one has stepped forward, and the missing dog has become a bit of an embarrassment. its stand remains empty on the median in the middle of the road, beside four other identical red and pink dog statues, an irritating reminder of the crime every time a deputy’s car drives by. “we have no leads, no sightings, no suspect information,” said lt. michael white of the los angeles county sheriff’s department station in west hollywood. he could not even say when exactly the statue disappeared — sometime between midnight and 8 a.m. the day after the parade, he said. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive

Article 4 - thousands rally against georgia’s once popular president
“if we allow a sitting parliament to extend its term for these months, this may happen again and again,” said giorgi khaindrava, a former government minister who is now in the opposition. “changing their term while in office violates a fundamental principle of democratic systems.” the demonstration signaled a significant degree of popular discontent with mr. saakashvili and his government, which inherited a country in near ruin four years ago and embarked upon an ambitious set of reforms. mr. saakashvili, a lawyer educated at columbia university, has steered his post-soviet country sharply toward the west, seeking admission to nato and the european union, while moving against corruption at home, especially in the police. he has often said he hoped to model his country’s development after the experience of the eastern european countries that were once under the kremlin’s yoke, and to bring democracy and free markets to the caucasus, a region with a history of corrupt, brutal and autocratic governments. he has set new standards for education, increased tax collection and revenue-generation, improved the readiness of the country’s once feeble army and repaired soviet-era infrastructure to the degree that the country, once plagued by blackouts, now has a reliable electricity supply. but some of the reforms have made him enemies, and he has alienated several prominent politicians, who find him domineering and abrasive. his opponents accuse him of hoarding and abusing power, and of running

Article 7 - avoiding trump, but adopting his divisive playbook: will it work in virginia?
mr. gillespie, who just a decade ago warned his party against the “siren song” of weaponizing immigration, has poured millions into racially tinged television ads and mailings that excoriate mr. northam on that issue, as well as confederate monuments, the restoration of felons’ rights and even football players who kneel during the national anthem. this onslaught over issues of culture and identity, a mix of the trumpian tactics of today with the unvarnished appeals from the past in a state defined by race since jamestown, has appalled democrats in virginia and beyond. the gut-punch approach has left even some republicans wincing over the spectacle of a former republican national committee chairman and new jersey native trying to win with earnest vows to guard emblems of the lost cause and with warnings about menacing hispanic gangs. yet mr. gillespie’s strategy has brought him within a few points of mr. northam in both public and private polling. a new york times upshot/siena college poll, released on sunday, showed mr. northam with just a three-point lead over mr. gillespie, 43 percent to 40 percent. that has forced nervous democrats to confront the reality that race, immigration and crime can be a potent mix even in a rapidly suburbanizing state where hillary clinton won by more than five points last year and where, overall, the president remains deeply unpopular. “i

Article 8 - in italy, rioting leads to recriminations
the center-right government sought to blame left-wing groups and their sympathizers. defense minister ignazio la russa attributed the violence to a tone used by the italian left in which “everything is justifiable as long as we can get rid of berlusconi.” those arrested, however, did little to lend credence to that accusation. news reports said that some of the 12 arrested were believed to belong to right-wing soccer fan groups, while others were linked to self-styled anarchist groups. to some italians, the images of rome in flames cast light on the government’s shortcomings, suggesting that a government elected promising law and order and led by a salesman once perfectly attuned to the national mood had lost control not only of the demonstration, but also of the economy, and increasingly of public opinion. the violence came at a time of deep political uncertainty. “italians are indulgent toward the government because they don’t see that there’s an alternative,” said massimo franco, a political commentator for the daily newspaper corriere della sera. “but when they realize that the government cannot do anything — and even makes fun of them, especially about the economy — at that point the lack of alternatives isn’t enough.” he added: “when italians turn the page, they turn it definitely. the big question is whether they’ve already turned the page.” the demonstration on saturday, one of more than 900 planned around the world to call attention to economic inequality, gave

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Summary:

The articles discuss various topics, including the Black Friday chaos and its supposed connections to a larger conspiracy. Some claim that central banks are preparing to make a move on gold, while others suggest that six corporations will rule the world.

Historical events mentioned include the Black Death in Europe and the Stone Age. A notable figure, Joseph Stalin, is quoted as saying ""the people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.""

Additionally, articles mention a supposed connection between the 9/11 attacks and a larger conspiracy theory.

Some articles also discuss the use of social media and online platforms to spread information and influence public opinion.

Notable quotes and statements are attributed to individuals such as Jasona Hollywood and Luke Rudkowski. However, it is unclear what evidence supports these claims or whether they are based on fact.

Overall, the articles present a mix of conspiracy theories, historical events, and social commentary, but lack concrete evidence to support many of their claims.

Classification criteria:

* Articles with no clear evidence or credible sources will be classified as unreliable.
* Articles that provide some evidence or credible sources, but also contain speculative or unsubstantiated claims, may be classified as partially reliable.
* Articles that present well-researched and supported claims will be classified as reliable.

Article 3 - what the world cup can teach about corruption
(before it's news) fighting corruption is a proven means to reduce inequality. but the issue has often been co-opted by elites looking to do just the opposite. walden bello brazil’s crushing world cup loss to germany’s world champion team wasn’t just bad news for brazilian football fans. it’s also likely to reignite the anger that many brazilians felt towards the government of president dilma rousseff for hosting such a spectacular eventwhen it could hardly afford decent public transport and social services for its citizens. corruption is also part of the explosive narrative. in the most expensive world cup ever, millions of brazilian taxpayer dollars went into corruption-plagued construction projects, including a new bridge in belo horizonte—site of the humiliating dismantling of brazil by germany—which has already collapsed. photo: sebástian freire / flickr with brazil stuck with a $$14-billion price tag and fifa—probably the most corrupt international sports body in the world—clearing a $$2-billion, tax-free profit, it is hard to see how rousseff’s center-left government can survive the coming blowback. in many ways, the episode encapsulates the complex relationship between the politics of progressivism and corruption in the developing world. corruption as unifying issue apart from passionate support for their national sports teams, hatred of government corruption and “crony capitalism” is one of the few issues that unite all social groups in developing countries. corruption is often the main

Article 6 - bankers above the law ii: criminal affirmance runs amok
bankers above the law ii: criminal affirmance runs amok (before it's news) professor mary ramirez recently posted her university of connecticut law review article on ssrn. it is available for free download. here is the abstract: recent financial scandals and the relative paucity of criminal prosecutions against elite actors that benefited from the crisis in response suggest a new reality in the criminal law system: some wrongful actors appear to be above the law and immune from criminal prosecution. as such, the criminal prosecutorial system affirms much of the wrongdoing giving rise to the crisis. this leaves the same elites undisturbed at the apex of the financial sector, and creates perverse incentives for any successors. their incumbency in power results in massive deadweight losses due to the distorted incentives they now face. further, this undermines the legitimacy of the rule of law and encourages even more lawlessness among the entire population, as the declination of prosecution advertises the profitability of crime. these considerations transcend deterrence as well as retribution as a traditional basis for criminal punishment. affirmance is far more costly and dangerous with respect to the crimes of powerful elites that control large organizations than can be accounted for under traditional notions of deterrence. few limits are placed on a prosecutor’s discretionary decision about whom to prosecute, and many factors against prosecution take hold, especially in resource-intensive white collar crime prosecutions. this article asserts that prosecutors should not decline prosecution in these circumstances without considering its potential affirmance of crime. otherwise,

Article 1 - australia suit over wheat for iraq
sydney, australia — six australian businessmen face the possibility of millions of dollars in fines in a new civil case connected with huge bribes paid to the government of saddam hussein. the men could also face criminal proceedings, but because the statute of limitations expires earlier for civil suits than for criminal cases, the authorities moved first on the civil action. the six men are all former senior managers of the australian wheat board, which an independent inquiry last year found had paid some $250 million in bribes to the iraqi government just as australian troops were preparing to go to war. the bribes, which the board paid to secure contracts to supply wheat under the united nations oil-for-food program, were disguised as transport fees paid to a jordanian trucking company partly owned by mr. hussein’s ministry of transport, the inquiry reported. advertisement continue reading the main story “the australian securities and investments commission alleges that the defendants contravened section 180 of the corporations act, which requires company officers to act with care and diligence, and section 181, which requires company officers to discharge their duties in good faith and for a proper purpose,” the commission said wednesday.

Article 2 - power and tenacity collide in a singapore courtroom
the three days of hearings, which ended wednesday, were held to determine how much in damages they now owe to mr. lee and his son, prime minister lee hsien loong. justice belinda ang said she would consider the arguments and issue her ruling later. mr. lee has made it a point to pursue his critics in the courts, determined to put them in their place and, he says, to clear any cloud around his name and legacy. photo “they know me by now,” mr. lee said of the people of singapore, “that if anybody impugns the integrity of the government, of which i was the prime minister, i must sue.” he added: “there are various parts of this government which do not comply with western practices, including the law of libel. but it is a system that has worked.” mr. lee and other singaporean leaders have won hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages from lawsuits against their critics and have been accused by human rights groups of using the lawsuits to silence opposition. mr. chee is already bankrupt after failing to pay 500,000 singapore dollars in libel damages to mr. lee and former prime minister goh chok tong for remarks he made during the 2001 elections. none of the critics contest mr. lee’s success in building singapore into one of the region’s most prosperous and stable countries since it became independent in 1965. even opponents like mr. chee credit him with bringing the good life

Article 3 - germany drafts wider ban on speculative trades
the law, which will take at least until september to win passage in parliament, would also ban naked short-selling of the euro, and enshrine a ban on use of so-called credit default swaps to bet against european government bonds. u.s. regulators have effectively banned naked short-selling of stocks since 2005. the practice involves a short-sale, or bet against a stock, without first holding shares of the security. all the measures aim to curtail investors who are perceived as little more than gamblers, as opposed to companies who use financial instruments to protect themselves against currency swings or other risk. “turbulence in the markets for european union government bonds and the volatility of the euro have reached a new dimension,” the text of the legislation said. “certain transactions that threaten the stability of financial markets should be forbidden.” mr. schäuble has expressed frustration that financial market regulation is moving too slowly, and said that he hoped other countries would follow germany’s lead. “politicians believe they need to show some activism,” said a top manager at an investment bank in germany, who did not want to be quoted because he often meets with government officials. the deputy finance minister, jörg asmussen, told the cnbc financial network on friday that germany preferred to work with its european partners and the group of 20 nations, but would go it alone if need be. advertisement continue reading the main story “we are willing to act and if necessary in an extreme case even on

Article 4 - as scandal unfolds, g.m. calls in the lawyers
for one, some of the firm’s lawyers may have to ask their own colleagues if they advised g.m. about whether to recall the vehicles at the time the melton case was settled. “they are part of the story,” said mr. cooper, whose firm is based in marietta, ga. there is a predictable trajectory to the modern institutional scandal: charges of wrongdoing surface, then mount, and then the company announces that it will bring in an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation. the announcement, made in sober, corporate language, sends a calming message: we’re not hiding. we’re taking this seriously. we’ve got this. hiring outside counsel in these cases is part investigation, part public-relations gambit and part legal strategy. in most cases, the goal isn’t to publicly flog a company or its top executives, but rather to limit damage to an institution’s reputation or to contain the financial harm to shareholders of a publicly traded company. and it does so under the protection of the attorney-client privilege. from the point of view of the company, a well-done internal investigation can shape the accepted story of what happened — and produce findings that allow the company to negotiate for lower penalties from prosecutors or regulators down the road. to achieve those ends, the law firms conducting the investigations must be viewed as forthright and uncompromised. in this respect, some critics have already questioned g.m.’s choices. the g.m. investigation will be led by anton r

Article 5 - malaysia and the trans-pacific partnership trade pact
to the editor: re “justice dept. rejects account of how malaysia’s leader acquired millions” (news article, july 23): i’ve been following your coverage of the scandal in malaysia, in which $700 million in government funds was moved to a bank account controlled by the prime minister and billions more to the accounts of others close to him. the justice department has just moved to seize $1 billion of these embezzled assets located in the united states. it would be easy to dismiss this situation as just another example of corruption halfway around the world, but in this case malaysia is a party to the pending trans-pacific partnership trade agreement. if approved, the tpp would give malaysia privileged access to the united states market in return for access to theirs. setting aside the unbalanced nature of that proposition, this scandal raises serious doubts about whether malaysia can live up to its end of the bargain. our state department has turned a blind eye to malaysia’s complicity in human trafficking, but the justice department’s recent actions underscore why we shouldn’t enter into economic partnership with bad actors like malaysia. this is one of hundreds of reasons congress should reject the tpp. louise slaughter rochester the writer, a democrat, represents new york’s 25th district in the house.

Article 6 - documents show kpmg secretly met prosecutors
the previously unseen notes convey the twists and turns of a legal drama, for sure — but for some criminal defense lawyers, their language bolsters the contention that the prosecution of kpmg was particularly zealous. kpmg fulfilled a two-year deferred prosecution agreement with the government last december and avoided criminal charges, but the effects of its ordeal continue. the handling of the case has significant implications for the prosecution of its former employees, as well as for a criminal case against deutsche bank, which is under federal investigation into its tax shelter work. no charges have been filed against it. the federal judge overseeing the prosecution of the former kpmg employees on criminal tax shelter charges has said that the government was coercive and violated the constitutional rights of the defendants by pressing kpmg to cut off payment of their legal fees as a condition of avoiding indictment itself. but to other legal observers, the notes of the discussions also highlight the gray areas between coercion and cooperation that typify corporate criminal investigations. “there’s a lot of posturing going on on both sides,” said peter henning, a former lawyer in the justice department’s criminal fraud division, after reviewing the notes. “the government was threatening to put kpmg out of business, but i don’t think they were serious.” the first meeting between kpmg and the prosecution described in the notes took place on march 2, 2005, at the manhattan office of federal prosecutors for the southern district of new york. advertisement continue

Article 7 - obama takes tougher antitrust line
the administration is hoping to encourage smaller companies in an array of industries to bring their complaints to the justice department about potentially improper business practices by their larger rivals. some of the biggest antitrust cases were initiated by complaints taken to the justice department. ms. varney said that the administration rejected the impulse to go easy on antitrust enforcement during weak economic times. instead, she said, severe recessions can provide dangerous incentives for large and dominating companies to engage in predatory behavior that harms consumers and weakens competition. “there is no adequate substitute for a competitive market, particularly during times of economic distress,” she said. “vigorous antitrust enforcement must play a significant role in the government’s response to economic crises to ensure that markets remain competitive.” the announcement is aimed at making sure that no court or party to a lawsuit can cite the bush administration policy as the government’s official view in any pending cases. ms. varney warned judges and litigants in antitrust lawsuits not involving the government to ignore the bush administration’s policies, which were formally outlined in a report by the justice department last year. the report applied legal standards that made it difficult to bring new cases involving monopoly and predatory practices. as a result of the bush administration’s interpretation of antitrust laws, the enforcement pipeline for major monopoly cases — which can take years for prosecutors to develop — is thin. during the bush administration, the justice department did not file a single case against a dominant firm for violating the antimonopoly law. advertisement

Article 8 - u.s. inquiry of drug makers is widened
now, prosecutors are investigating whether the payments made to doctors who conducted these studies abroad were appropriate. if evidence shows that such payments have influenced the results of some clinical trials, prosecutors will be inspecting the trials closely, mr. ogrosky said. an article about the inquiry appeared friday in the financial times. last month, a federal drug official reported that he found repeated instances in a landmark clinical trial of avandia, a controversial diabetes medicine, in which patients taking avandia appeared to suffer serious heart problems that were not counted in the study’s crucial tally of adverse events. many of the study’s trial sites were in foreign countries, and the study is a main reason that avandia remains on the market in the united states. government officials have not accused glaxosmithkline, the trial’s sponsor, of fraud. “at the justice department, investigations that involve allegations of patient harm rise straight to the top and will attract the immediate attention of the f.b.i.,” mr. ogrosky said. the pharmaceutical industry may be more vulnerable to such investigations because its representatives overseas work on a daily basis with officials or doctors employed by state health systems. because pharmaceutical companies “are in the health care sector and because, in so many foreign countries, heath sector employees could be considered foreign officials, there is a heightened risk there,” said jay darden, a washington lawyer and former federal prosecutor who specialized in health care and foreign corrupt practice cases. but, he said

3636573.0,fake,fake,0.8,108.30381441116332,True,"The article ""captain obvious in da house"" contains several red flags that indicate it is not reliable news. Firstly, the tone of the article is sarcastic and dismissive, which suggests a biased perspective. Additionally, the language used is colloquial and informal, which may be indicative of a blog post or social media post rather than a reputable news source.  The article also makes several claims that are not supported by facts in the provided summaries. For example, it states that ""the regs are there specifically to create those barriers"" and that ""anyone who's been paying attention the past 3 years understands this."" These statements are unsubstantiated and lack concrete evidence to support them.  Furthermore, the article appears to be a personal opinion piece rather than a factual report. The language used is often rhetorical and emotive, which suggests that the author is trying to persuade readers rather than inform them about actual events or policies.  In contrast, the reliable news summary provides a more balanced and neutral account of various topics related to the Obama administration's policies, including tax laws, healthcare reform, and executive orders. The language used is formal and objective, and the summary provides specific examples and data to support its claims. Overall, the article ""captain obvious in da house"" does not align with the facts or tone of the reliable news summary, indicating that it is likely a piece of fake news.","The articles discuss various aspects of the Obama administration's policies, including tax laws, healthcare reform, and executive orders. 

A new tax law has been drafted with 13,000 pages of regulations, which is a lengthy and massive undertaking still in its early stages. The Health and Human Services Department received $1 billion for implementation, leading to concerns about additional bureaucrats and programs.

The Obama administration's vow of ""no bailouts"" was met with criticism from both liberals and conservatives, who argue that big government and big business often work together to thwart the free market.

A computer system glitch has limited penalties under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which is expected to price millions of smokers out of health insurance. The IRS, Health and Human Services, and other agencies are writing thousands of pages of regulations for the ACA.

Congressional leaders have been seeking a way to exempt themselves from receiving the same health benefits as citizens under the ACA's government-run exchanges. A recent vote lowered the GOP's demand significantly, leaving virtually all of Obamacare intact.

The estimated cost of subsidizing plans through the ACA's exchanges has grown from $3,970 in 2010 to $5,510, with a projected increase of nearly 29% by 2022. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects 7 million workers will lose their employer-sponsored health insurance.

Executive orders signed by President Trump have been met with criticism, as they are seen as taking away subsidies and allowing for the addition of a propeller to a single-engine plane that is magically being kept afloat due to government regulations.","The Obama administration allowed states to define ""essential health benefits"" under the Affordable Care Act, potentially reducing opposition in Republican-led states. However, insurance company lobbyists may shape requirements to favor their bottom lines.

President Trump's economic legacy is being reassessed, with a focus on the decline of the national debt and the improvement of the economy since his inauguration. The private sector has added 14.4 million new jobs.

A tax bill proposed by President Trump includes both cuts and increases, aiming for tax reform. However, recent polls suggest that only about 30% of Americans support the plan.

Barack Obama's health care proposal involves injecting cash from repealing Bush tax cuts and implementing electronic health information technology. Critics argue that this approach may not save money in the long run.

Democrats are seeking to rebuild their party after the 2016 election, focusing on economic growth and communicating effectively with moderate voters.

President Trump made over 282 campaign promises during his final days on the campaign trail, including creating jobs, bringing back manufacturing, and encouraging manufacturers to build factories in the United States.

The Republican Party has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but some centrists and the D.C. establishment have hindered this effort, presenting President Trump with potential bills that are far from ideal.

obama’s new tax law: lawyers have already drafted 13,000 pages of regulations… % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) it’s a lawyer’s dream! officials have already drafted 13,000 pages of new regulations for the new obama tax law. health care law a green light, federal and state officials are turning to implementation of the law — a lengthy and massive undertaking still in its early stages, but already costing money and expanding the government. with the supreme court giving president obama’s newlaw a green light, federal and state officials are turning to implementation of the law — a lengthy and massive undertaking still in its early stages, but already costing money and expanding the government. the health and human services department “was given a billion dollars implementation money,” republican rep. denny rehberg of montana said. “that money is gone already on additional bureaucrats and it programs, computerization for the implementation.” insurance marketplaces in every state in the country, places you can go online, compare health plans.” “oh boy,” stan dorn of the urban institute said. “hhs has a huge amount of work to do and the states do, too. there will be new healthmarketplaces in every state in the country, places you can go online, compare health plans.” the irs, health and human services and many other agencies will now write thousands of pages of regulations — an effort well under way

Article 2 - no more bipartisan bailouts by michael d. tanner
no more bipartisan bailouts by michael d. tanner (before it's news) one of the few lines in president obama’s state of the union address that actually received bipartisan applause was his vow of “no bailouts, no handouts, and no cop outs.” of course the president then went on to claim credit for his bailout of the auto industry and promise additional handouts to the “green energy” industry. both liberals and conservatives often succumb to a narrative that pits big government against big business. no doubt many of big government’s tax and regulatory policies do make it more difficult for businesses to expand and hire people. but just as often, big business and big government are all too happy to work hand in hand to thwart the free market.confusing support for free markets with support for the corporate agenda is a bipartisan failing. in a free market, for example, corporations compete against one another on their merits. government doesn’t pick winners and losers or prefer one type of industry over another. yet, rick santorum shares president obama’s desire for special tax breaks for “manufacturing.” both newt gingrich and mitt romney join president obama in backing government subsidies for ethanol and other alternative energy. and obviously, in a free market, when businesses fail because they made stupid investment decisions, they go bankrupt. but both romney and gingrich joined president obama (and president bush) in supporting tarp and the bailout of some of america’s biggest banks and investment

Article 3 - the obamatax hits just keep on coming
as we noted earlier, “ [m]illions of smokers could be priced out of health insurance because of tobacco penalties in [the obamatax] .” typically, insurers ding smokers (well, tobacco users, really) 30% or more. under the obamatax, this is likely to rise to 50% over non-smoker rates. that is, they were supposed to. but just like the (evil) employer mandate, this integral part of the obamatax is is coming up short: “the obama administration … has quietly notified insurers that a computer system glitch will limit penalties that the law says the companies may charge smokers.” actually, given that ms shecantbeserious (et al) can’t confirm employer group eligibility, and will rely on the “honor system” for subsidies, how many folks would admit to tobacco use anyway? and since plans are guaranteed issue, who cares how accurately an application is completed? after all, who’s to know?

Article 4 - desperate congress realizes they're getting obamacare, seeks a waiver
desperate congress realizes they're getting obamacare, seeks a waiver (before it's news) for years, congress has enjoyed a fantastic health benefits program, better than that of most americans. but during the debate over obamacare, senator chuck grassley (r-ia) managed to get language into the bill that requires members of congress and their staff to purchase their insurance through a government-run health insurance exchange like every other citizen under obamacare. naturally, some members of congress were none too happy about this, and lo and behold, politico reported earlier this year that congressional leaders have quietly been looking for a way to exempt themselves from receiving the same (inferior) health benefits that they have foisted upon those who elected them. this hypocrisy is made possible by a flaw in the grassley amendment, which unfortunately is not absolutely specific regarding whether congress is to receive the same (inferior) levels of insurance premium subsidies as other americans, or the same (generous) subsidies it always has. the insurance premium subsidies under obamacare are not nearly as generous as what congress is currently receiving – so, naturally, some members have been looking for a way to keep their old, special deal. the grassley amendment’s ambiguity has left the hypocrites with a big opening for mischief. congressmen and staffers are anxiously awaiting official word on this issue from the office of personnel management (opm), which administers the federal employees health benefits (fehb) plan and has the power to

(photo credit: wikipedia) america has made her decision. progressives, liberals and low information voters ruled the day and decided that barack obama’s record of epic failure and malaise was good enough. this motley coalition of “me-first” malcontents and fairness hustlers was enough to push pharaoh obama over the top and into another four years of despotic rule where executive orders pass for law and lies pass for the truth. we, the god fearing patriots of the united states of america felt like the country deserved better but in the end our efforts were in vain except for the inner contentment that comes with knowing you did all you could do. in the end it was not enough and the country was taken off life support where most of us expect her to die a slow and agonizing death as the cancer of redistribution, excessive regulation and corruption eats away at her. the country will not survive this. there will not after four more years be a way to pull the country back from the brink as it will have long since passed the point of no return. as middle aged people enter their third or fourth year of

Article 6 - house republicans have hurt their chance to defund obamacare
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! from former congressman ernest istook via washington times – washington, october 2, 2013 — republicans in the u.s. house of representatives may have painted themselves into a corner. they evidently will settle for symbolism to end the ongoing government slowdown. that would leave virtually all of obamacare intact and more difficult than ever to defund or repeal. the most-recent house vote lowered the gop’s demand significantly. the original vote (plan a) coupled funding for the rest of government with a defunding of obamacare. the second vote late sunday night (plan b) offered to fund all of government in exchange for two things: a) a one-year delay in the individual mandate, plus b) enforcement of the requirement that congress get its own insurance through obamacare. by lowering their goals voluntarily, the gop has reduced the chance that they will accomplish anything substantive rather than symbolic regarding obamacare. rather than accepting plan b, the white house is standing back while the media trashes and blames republicans for what is called a shutdown. (huge parts of “essential” government remain on-the-job, so” slowdown” is a term that fits much better.) when obama figures he’s gathered enough election year ammunition, he could pivot. posturing as magnanimous, obama would need only minor negotiations to close a deal along the lines of plan b. the house essentially has backed down to

Article 7 - obamacare exchange costs up 29% before program even starts!
headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! one of the big features of the affordable care act (a.k.a. health-care reform or obamacare) is the creation of exchanges where people can buy subsidized insurance plans. there’s a raft of implementation issues as states try to figure out whether they want to set up their own exchanges or go along with federal ones. here’s something that only makes 2014, the year obamacare fully comes online, even more dread-worthy: the estimated cost of subsidizing plans through obamacare’s exchanges has grown from $3,970 in 2010 to $5,510. here’s john merline of investors business: the cbo’s new baseline estimate shows that obamacare subsidies offered through the insurance exchanges — which are supposed to be up and running by next january — will total more than $1 trillion through 2022, up from $814 billion over those same years in its budget forecast made a year ago. that’s an increase of nearly 29%… last year, the cbo said the average exchange subsidy for those getting federal help when obamacare goes into effect next year would be $4,780. its latest estimate raised that to $5,510 — a 15% increase. all these numbers are up even more from the cbo’s original forecast made in 2010, which had the first-year subsidy average at $3,970. the cbo also expects 7 million workers will lose their employer

Article 8 - trump obamacare executive orders: an analysis and opinion
trump obamacare executive orders: an analysis and opinion (before it's news) this is a long analysis, so if you’d like to read the key summary, here you go: it’s kind of like this. you have two problems in your single engine plane that is magically being kept afloat even though it really is not fit for flying. the reason it is not fit for flying is the government has created regulations that cause you to point the ailerons always down, as well as regulations that don’t allow you to attach a propeller to your plane. the plane is being held up in the air by a giant jumbo liner that’s about four times as expensive to fly as the single engine plane you have. that would be all the subsidies in the system. along comes donny with his executive orders that take away the jumbo plane and allow you to add the prop. what happens? well, the plane shoots right towards the ground. everyone aboard the plane is screaming for their very lives. then along comes the next president, or maybe a veto-proof congress, and they say, hey, see what we told you? you need government. this is why it is evil to take government out of healthcare. the plane will crash. tell you what – let’s make a bigger jumbo liner to carry this plane and for the love of humanity, get that freaking propeller off the plane. the people in the plane rejoice that they have been saved by the government, not

-----------------------
Article 1 - ‘essential benefits’ and health reform
the obama administration surprised supporters and critics when it decided to let states define the “essential health benefits” that must be provided to their citizens under health care reform. the move could lessen opposition in republican-led states and increase the chances that they will move ahead on building new health insurance exchanges to comply with the reform law. the impact on most consumers may be minimal. even the most fiercely antiregulation states will not be free to approve extremely miserly policies, because they will have to be comparable to popular and fairly comprehensive “benchmark” private plans. there are concerns that insurance company lobbyists — who are even more powerful in many states than in washington — will find ways to shape requirements to favor their bottom lines rather than consumers. in the longer run, it would be better to set a national standard. that would also be easier for federal regulators to monitor. the health care reform law requires private health insurers that sell policies to individuals and small businesses to provide, starting in 2014, a set of “essential health benefits” in 10 categories, including hospitalization, ambulatory care, maternity care, prescription drugs and laboratory services. the law also said the benefits should be comparable to those provided under “a typical employer plan.” but it left it up to the secretary of health and human services to define what benefits are “essential” and what employer plans are “typical.” now secretary kathleen sebelius has passed those decisions to the states, at least for a two-year transition

Article 3 - president obama weighs his economic legacy
but the president did seem frustrated. as he tried to sum up his economic legacy in florida, our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned, seemingly to the consternation of the secret service. when we got back on air force one, he sent an aide to ask if we could continue the conversation; when i joined him again, he looked as if he’d been stewing over something. he quickly returned to the topic of public perception. “if you ask the average person on the streets, ‘have deficits gone down or up under obama?’ probably 70 percent would say they’ve gone up,” obama said, with some justifiable exasperation — the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly three-quarters) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of americans believe the opposite. obama is animated by a sense that, looking at the world around him, the u.s. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates, especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility — now rarely even considered — that things could have been much, much worse. over a series of conversations in the oval office, on air force one and in florida, obama analyzed, sometimes with startling frankness, nearly every element of his economic agenda since he came into office. his economy has certainly come further than most people recognize. the private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months — some 14.4 million new jobs

Article 4 - donald trump wants to raise your taxes
republican leaders certainly have a path to passing a tax bill, because nothing unites modern republicans the way a tax cut does. but the opposition to the recent health care bills also started as an underdog and managed to prevail, by relentlessly talking about the bills’ effects. when enough americans understood the truth, enough members of congress felt pressure to vote no. the same could happen on taxes. it is already starting to. recent polls suggest the plan’s approval rating is only about 30 percent. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the opinion today newsletter every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from op-ed columnists, the times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. to understand the trump tax increases, you should first acknowledge the most admirable feature of his plan. it doesn’t aspire to be merely a tax cut. it aspires to be tax reform — both cuts and increases. some deductions shrink, while rates fall, in the name of simplifying the tax code. but after this promising start, the plan commits its cardinal sin. it places the highest priority on huge tax cuts

Article 5 - obama’s health plan, dissected
easton, conn., july 23, 2008  to the editor: barack obama proposes to make health care affordable for all americans with an injection of cash from the repeal of the bush tax cuts and with savings realized from electronic health information technology and programs to improve disease prevention and chronic disease management. while better record-keeping and prevention and management programs would improve the quality of our medical system, there is little data that they would actually save money. they certainly would not do so for many years. most waste in our health care system is a result of our reliance on private health insurers. having multiple competing insurers results in costs for marketing, underwriting, billing, claims adjudication, executive salaries and profit. administrative costs account for 31 percent of all health care spending in the united states, but only 17 percent in canada’s single payer system. the administrative costs of america’s own single-payer system, medicare, are only about 3 percent, compared with 12 to 15 percent for private insurers. if mr. obama wants to save enough to provide health care for every american, he needs to open the debate to include consideration of medicare for all in the united states. rachel nardin photo cambridge, mass., july 23, 2008 the writer, an assistant professor of neurology at harvard medical school, is chairwoman of the massachusetts chapter of physicians for a national health program.  to the

Article 6 - where do democrats go next?
and we were too deferential to our most zealous supporters. during election season, congress sought to placate those on the extreme left and motivate the base — but that meant that our final efforts before the election focused on trying to allow gays in the military, change our immigration system and repeal the george w. bush-era tax cuts. these are legitimate issues but unlikely to resonate with moderate swing voters in a season of economic discontent. with these lessons in mind, democrats can begin to rebuild. where to start? first, we have more than a communications problem — the public heard us but disagreed with our approach. democrats need not reassess our goals for america, but we need to seriously rethink how to reach them. second, don’t blame the voters. they aren’t stupid or addled by fear. they are skeptical about government efficacy, worried about the deficit and angry that democrats placed other priorities above their main concern: economic growth. so, in the near term, every policy must be viewed through a single prism: does it help the economy grow? newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. a good place to start

Article 7 - ‘i will give you everything.’ here are 282 of donald trump’s campaign promises.
in donald trump’s final days on the campaign trail, he promised his supporters that “every dream you ever dreamed for your country” will come true if he becomes president — one of dozens of sweeping promises he made and is now expected to fulfill. in january, i compiled a list of 76 campaign promises trump had made. since then, the list has grown to 282, collected from trump’s speeches, public comments, tweets and campaign and transition websites. jobs 1) create at least 25 million jobs and “be the greatest jobs president that god ever created.” 2) bring back manufacturing jobs from china, mexico, japan and elsewhere. states that can expect a rush of jobs include pennsylvania, north carolina, michigan, ohio, florida, new hampshire, iowa, nevada, new york and virginia. 3) encourage manufacturers to build or grow factories in the united states with tax incentives . 4) refuse to eat another oreo until nabisco fully moves production back to the united states from mexico. 5) tell ford’s president that unless he cancels plans to build a massive plant in mexico, the auto company will face a 35 percent tax on cars imported back into the united states. trump is confident he can get this done before taking office. (trump has twice incorrectly said this has already happened.) 6) “get apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in

Article 8 - republicans must keep promise to repeal obamacare
the views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect the editorial opinion of the christian post or its editors. expand | collapse ken blackwell is the senior fellow for family empowerment at the family research council, and the ronald reagan distinguished fellow for public policy at the buckeye institute in columbus, ohio as the legendary robert novak once said, ""god put the republican party on earth to cut taxes. if they don't do that, they have no useful function."" president donald trump has promised bold reagan-like tax cuts to spur economic growth. however, with health care premiums skyrocketing and the devastating effect on businesses, america desperately needs to repeal the obamacare tax. for seven years, congressional republicans on the campaign trail promised to repeal former president barack obama's signature healthcare legislation. now, after a historic election, what is the delay? the ""fake news"" media spin is to blame this on the conservative freedom caucus, including my friend rep. jim jordan (r-oh) for standing on principal and demanding a full repeal of obamacare. but the real blame belongs to so-called centrists and the d.c. establishment that has worked too closely with the insurance industry to defend many of the healthcare law's worst mandates. and the same obamacare-repeal bills that congress repeatedly passed during the obama-era are now ignored. the republican leadership has put president trump in an uncomfortable situation, presenting him with potential bills that are far from ideal and do not

Title: captain obvious in da house
Content: as bob spent most of the morning pointing out ( here and here ), the obamatax does little but increase our costs; whether they’re called premiums or taxes is of little consequence to our checkbooks. a new study by the national center for policy analysis finds that, contra-obamatax expectations, “americans, who on average fill a dozen prescriptions a year, would benefit from free competition.” no kidding. in some ways, this is the fox butterfield effect hard at work: “[t]he study argues that the many new regulations, often enacted in the name of protecting consumers, are having the opposite effect, placing barriers to efficiency“ that is – and this will be no surprise to regular ib readers – the regs are there specifically to create those barriers. anyone who’s been paying attention the past 3 years understands this: decreased efficiency leads to more regulations, and thus more government overreach. but then, that’s been the real game all along.

The Obama administration allowed states to define ""essential health benefits"" under the Affordable Care Act, potentially reducing opposition in Republican-led states. However, insurance company lobbyists may shape requirements to favor their bottom lines.

President Trump's economic legacy is being reassessed, with a focus on the decline of the national debt and the improvement of the economy since his inauguration. The private sector has added 14.4 million new jobs.

A tax bill proposed by President Trump includes both cuts and increases, aiming for tax reform. However, recent polls suggest that only about 30% of Americans support the plan.

Barack Obama's health care proposal involves injecting cash from repealing Bush tax cuts and implementing electronic health information technology. Critics argue that this approach may not save money in the long run.

Democrats are seeking to rebuild their party after the 2016 election, focusing on economic growth and communicating effectively with moderate voters.

President Trump made over 282 campaign promises during his final days on the campaign trail, including creating jobs, bringing back manufacturing, and encouraging manufacturers to build factories in the United States.

The Republican Party has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but some centrists and the D.C. establishment have hindered this effort, presenting President Trump with potential bills that are far from ideal.

These articles highlight key aspects of healthcare reform, economic policy, and presidential legacies, providing a foundation for understanding current events in the United States.

Article 1 - on to the playoffs!
on to the playoffs! % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the bulls wrapped up a great season down at gwinnett yesterday and have a day off before their first round playoff game against the indianapolis indians tomorrow. first pitch: 6:35. statistically, these two teams are a wash in essentially everything but the won-loss column and, probably, the performance of their bullpens. we’d expect the bulls to have a better bullpen. on the other hand, the bulls offensive performance since mid-season has been nothing special. recent days: the bulls are 9-6 over the last 15 games; the indians are 9-6 over the last 15 games. it may come down to call-ups and in that regard, the bulls’ relief pitching may be at a slight disadvantage. on the other hand, the first couple of starters are awfully good (yarborough, chirinos, & honeywell). the bulls have an edge on the season against the indians, 6-4, and just recently won 2 out of 3 at the dbap. meanwhile, a shout-out to the ironpigs who put together a 6-game winning streak to grab the wild card slot on the last day of the regular season! they get to play scranton/wilkes-barre in the first round, the same team they’ve played for their last four regular season games (and

red sox report: grady sizemore shakes up opening day roster headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! grady sizemore is in line to open the season as boston’s center fielder. (michael ivins/getty images) when the boston red sox signed grady sizemore in late january, it was a depth move. a one-year, $750,000 contract with up to $6 million in incentives was about what could be expected for a player who last saw regular playing time in july of 2011, almost three years ago. although the red sox opened camp with the expectation that prospect jackie bradley, jr. would be manning center field following the departure of jacoby ellsbury, those expectations have changed. a year ago, it was bradley jr.’s hot spring that forced the red sox hand, and allowed him to start the season in the majors. now, it’s another new face’s strong spring that is complicating john farrell’s opening day roster. the red sox signed sizemore with the intention of stashing him in triple-a, or possibly keeping him as the fifth outfielder, should they move mike carp or someone got injured. having not played baseball in over two years seemed reason enough to not expect the former mvp-candidate to make much of an impact. but then spring training started. as of march 19

Article 6 - greatest durham bulls
greatest durham bulls headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the other day i called hideki matsui a great ballplayer, but not a great durham bull. that set me to wondering, who are the greatest durham bulls? how would i go about finding out? regular readers know that i consider myself exclusively a durham bulls fan, so to my way of thinking a great durham bull is not necessarily a player who achieves stardom at another place and time. my interest is in what the player did as a durham bull. thus, for example, carl crawford, who only played 85 games for the bulls back in 2002, or evan longoria, who played all of 31 games back in 2007, simply didn’t have much impact as bulls. another consideration is, which durham bulls team? i’m lazy. i just don’t feel like trolling through the records for the last 100 years. so, i limited myself to just the aaa durham bulls, a franchise to the the tampa bay rays (née devil rays), who started playing baseball in 1998. how do you measure greatness? especially at the aaa level? well, one way is to simply take a look at how often a player showed up for work. that is, how many games he played. that may seem to be an odd measure, but think about it. in minor league ball if a

Title: m.l.s. suspends two red bulls

takeaway art exhibit % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) the jewish museum in nyc, which is a terrific art institution, is doing a show next month in which forty contemporary artists will create over 400,000 artworks that visitors will be encouraged to “take away” with them when they visit the show. this exhibit was inspired by a similar show that took place at the serpentine gallery in london in 1995. to help fund the production costs of all of this takeaway art, the museum has launched a kickstarter, which the gotham gal and i both backed yesterday. backers can select from a number of these takeaway art works as rewards. there are also some great in person talks with the show’s curators in the rewards. here’s the project video in case this project interests you like it did us. if you want to participate in the funding of this show, you can back the kickstarter here. source: http://avc.com/2016/08/takeaway-art-exhibit/

(before it's news) anything and everything anytime washington post – after 50 years of imaginary intergalactic service and epic flights of science fiction, the starship enterprise, registry number ncc-1701, lies in pieces on a table at the smithsonian national air and space museum’s steven f. udvar-hazy center in virginia. x-rays of its insides hang on the walls of the conservation unit. parts of the ship’s poplar-and-fiberglass hull are exposed. and the bridge, where fictional starfleet capt. james t. kirk once sat, has been removed. enterprise is a venerable ship — launched in 1964 at a burbank, calif., prop maker’s shop for the original “star trek” television series. it’s also a piece of history, along with the wright brothers’ “flyer” and charles lindbergh’s “spirit of st. louis.” the museum is now restoring the make-believe voyager as a part of america’s real-life air and space heritage. – ariel o’connor, a conservator at the museum, shows where screws were hidden under a rail on the main body of the enterprise model. – the lighting effect (oscillating look of movement) was achieved with blinking christmas lights and a spinning fan mechanism

caravaggio: 100 drawings just discovered…really? (before it's news) medusa, after 1590, by caravaggio; uffizi gallery, florence, italy (photo credit: wikipedia caravaggio is one of my favorite painters. imagine my joy when two italian art experts unveiled last week their discovery of 100 drawings dating to caravaggio’s youth before he came to rome and became famous. in fact, caravaggio’s formative years are a complete mystery, no one has ever seen any drawings or early work of the master. which is why the discovery of 100 early drawings by caravaggio is a major finding. or would be a major finding if true. it’s a pity the two experts didn’t go the usual route of peer review and publishing their findings in a respected art journal. instead they chose to produce an e-book and have it published by amazon in four languages – or so it is reported in the press. i was only able to find the italian version, here: including vat and wireless delivery, it costs a hefty $$17.50 (we e-book readers are not used to such prices!) but then it’s a big book (over 470 pages) and it has plenty of illustrations. it is only available on advanded devices like the kindle fire, or else you can read it on your computer (kindle cloud reader) or the kindle for ipad or android. i downloaded a sample

Article 7 - message to the voting cattle
message to the voting cattle % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) a message to the voting cattle from the larken rose audiobook ‘the iron web’ really puts in perspective the hypocrisy of supporting the government’s crimes. note: while some of the analogies are over the top, they are clearly done for dramatic effect. “what you hear in this video is from the audiobook of “the iron web,” a novel i wrote years ago. (the printed book and audiobook are at larkenrose.com). these are the words of a fictional character in the book, and he says quite a bit more. and yes, the character is rather harsh in his condemnation of state-worship, but for a reason. if you have the story context of who is saying it, where, when, and why, some of it makes more sense. many thanks to freiwilligfrei for making this video.” larken rose this video is a us-version of the video “nachricht an das stimmvieh”, produced by freiwilligfrei.de, a german group of bloggers and activists. http://www.freiwilligfrei.info/ focuses on voluntarism and the philosophy of freedom. the “rulers” actually don’t matter. they are vastly outnumbered by the people like you and me. the problem is those who legitimate the “rulers” with their votes, remaining silent when

Article 8 - martin grant’s collection spring/summer 2016
was this martin grant’s best collection up to now?? the supporters seem to think so. not that they were wrong, but the question has to be asked: based on what? here’s one theory: it felt thoughtfully composed. grant picked up where his pre-collection left off by reintroducing the linen-wool blend that he uses in place of denim, as well as the silk organza feather tinsel, aka his “summer fur.” and once again, he barely left the confines of black, warm white, and navy. the prints—a paint splotch and a medley of stripes—were created by hand and counterbalanced the rough-hewn silk and double-face cotton with rhythmic lift. in the end, grant doesn’t leave us with much space to report—no theme, inspiration, muse, or talking points—which might leave us the false impression that the collection was very light on ideas. is it his best collection up to date? perhaps only grant is equipped to judge. but judging against his recent endeavors, it was right up there.

Article 1 - rockwell’s children sue berkshire museum to stop sale of his works
“this move is also antithetical to the museum’s stated charitable purpose, and is financially unnecessary,” michael b. keating, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. photo lawyers for the plaintiffs have asked for a temporary restraining order to halt the auctions, which are to be handled by sotheby’s. the two paintings by norman rockwell, the most valuable among the works for sale, are scheduled to be offered on nov. 13. nineteen works are set to be auctioned by march, with others to follow. in a statement late friday, william f. lee, a lawyer for the berkshire museum, said, “we are confident that the museum has the right to go forward and that the lawsuit is factually and legally flawed.” maura healey, the massachusetts attorney general, is also named in the lawsuit as a so-called necessary party because it is her office’s job to oversee public charities like the museum. emily snyder, a spokeswoman for ms. healey, said her office “has been closely reviewing” whether there are restrictions on the museum’s ability to sell the art, and that it would also review friday’s filings. since announcing its “new vision” plan in july, the berkshire museum has been criticized by some prominent museum organizations, which believe that proceeds from the sale of artworks should be reserved for acquiring other works — not remedying budget shortfalls. in a telephone interview on friday, mr. ke

Article 2 - the modern finds a temporary home in queens
the museum of modern art, one of manhattan's top cultural landmarks, is picking up and moving to long island city in queens this summer, hoping that tourists and art lovers will follow. the museum, on west 53rd street, closes its doors on tuesday and they will stay shut for three years, awaiting completion of the japanese architect yoshio taniguchi's new and enlarged version. on june 29, the doors will open at moma queens or qns, shorthand for the modern's new site at 33rd street and queens boulevard. visitors arriving from manhattan on the no. 7 subway line, which stops directly across the street, will know they have arrived when they see the giant letters moma on the building's roof. the temporary museum, which began life as a staple factory, has been painted bright blue on the outside, and on the inside has been reconfigured to provide gallery space for changing exhibits as well as a sampling of masterworks from the modern's permanent collections, such as van gogh's ''starry night'' (1889) and picasso's ''demoiselles d'avignon'' (1907). this summer, the modern will take advantage of the wide, sweeping spaces at the queens site and present for the first time its collection of automobiles, including the oldest, pininfarina's cisitalia 202 gt (1946), and arguably its fastest, ferrari's formula 1 racing car

Article 4 - national academy revises its policies
the association in turn offered to help the academy work through its problems, but made no pledge to remove penalties. “there are no promises about the lifting of sanctions, nor was there a request to do so — sanctions never came up,” said michael conforti, president of the museum directors’ association, in an interview. “but clearly this is a step in the process of re-engaging the academy as a member in good standing.” the academy’s sale of the two paintings — frederic edwin church’s “scene on the magdalene,” from 1854, and sanford robinson gifford’s “mount mansfield, vermont,” from 1859 — came shortly before brandeis university’s january announcement that it would close its rose art museum and sell its collection to help shore up the university’s finances. (brandeis has since said it would form a committee to consider the future of the museum.) together those decisions spurred concerns that more institutions would follow suit. new york assemblyman richard l. brodsky, a westchester county democrat and brandeis alumnus, has introduced legislation with the state board of regents to set deaccessioning guidelines for new york museums. “this is going to smack us in the face, as more cultural institutions face the consequences of the fiscal crisis,” mr. brodsky said. “we need a reasoned, responsible set of laws.” michael botwinick, executive director of the hudson

Article 6 - local museums tapping into big-city exhibitions
it is always chancy to read trends into museum exhibitions, especially when examples are isolated and scattered. but at least one thing seems clear. the first inkling came about a year ago, when the bruce museum of arts and sciences in greenwich, conn., initiated and staged an impressive exhibition of oil sketches by the early 17th-century flemish artist peter paul rubens to dovetail nicely with a weighty touring exhibition of his drawings at the metropolitan museum of art in new york city. the bruce exhibition received more than 31,000 visitors, making it among the museum's best-attended exhibitions in recent years. since then, many regional art museums in the area have staged exhibitions that shadow or complement city shows, or that are presented collaboratively with city counterparts. suburban museums are making a bid to be part of a wider cultural conversation. and it doesn't hurt that such exhibitions are, well, good for business. with companion shows, the regional museums can piggyback on the publicity for a bigger exhibition in the city and snare more visitors, even from the city. ''part of the logic behind these exhibitions is, i admit, to try and get an audience from the city to come discover the museum,'' said peter c. sutton, executive director of the bruce. but, he said, it is also about realizing that many of the visitors who attend museums in the city and elsewhere live in the suburbs. ''rubens proved that the art-viewing

Article 7 - portrait of a library testing the art world
“there was an awful lot of soul-searching,” said anne robinson, the president of the library’s board, who moved to one of those grand neighboring mansions from manhattan after 9/11. “what are our needs and what are our resources, and how do we balance them?” it’s a question that many other institutions have wrestled with — most recently and prominently brandeis university, which last month abruptly announced that it would close its art museum and sell its entire collection — and the library’s trustees consulted with several of them. the board discussed its options at its regular meetings for six months last year in the conference room beside the library’s extensive archives of local history. “what do we do with a painting that costs us $25,000 a year to insure, that we can’t display, that nobody has ever seen, that wasn’t painted by a plainfield artist, that wasn’t painted in plainfield, that isn’t a scene of plainfield, and is worth millions of dollars?” ms. robinson asked. “shouldn’t we use that for the betterment of plainfield?” photo the paintings, as well as a lithograph that is much less valuable, were owned by benjamin m. day, who had lived in north plainfield and died in 1905. his widow died in 1930, and the next year their only child, benjamin m. day jr., gave the homers to the library, where they had previously

Article 8 - visit to the met could cost you, if you don’t live in new york
unlike several manhattan museums that charge admission, the met is considered a public museum: new york city owns its building and also gives the museum $26 million a year — the largest amount that the city provides to an arts institution. still, the city’s appropriation to the met covers just about 8 percent of the museum’s $332 million annual operating costs. the met’s current “suggested” adult admissions fee, $25, generated about $39 million in the fiscal year 2016, or 13 percent of the museum’s overall revenue. a mandatory fee would be likely to generate tens of millions of dollars more a year, providing a much-needed shot in the arm. should the met earn these additional millions, the city might become more inclined to shift public money to other arts groups, a prospect that city officials are now considering as part of a new cultural plan, to be released soon. the city may view the met’s new income as a replacement for its public dollars, which could be risky if admission fees prove less reliable than annual city funding. but the mayor said wednesday that an admission fee would not necessarily jeopardize city support. “i don’t think we have an assumption about city funding,” mr. de blasio said. “it’s about them being able to sustain their operations long term and would actually mean they wouldn’t need additional city funding, in theory. but no, the real issue is just to allow them to defray some of their costs in a

Title: rose art museum remains open, for now
Content: brandeis university said on friday that it would allow its rose art museum, above, to remain open while its fate is being decided. university trustees voted in january to close the museum with the goal of selling artworks to raise money to aid brandeis’s ailing endowment. after the vote, the university backtracked, saying that no works would be sold in the immediate future and that the building would remain open as an art-study center. the massachusetts attorney general’s office is reviewing brandeis’s plans. in a letter to the university on friday, marty wyngaarden krauss, brandeis’s provost, said the museum’s current exhibitions would be extended through may 17 and then closed while the shows are taken down and an exhibition of works from the permanent collection, chosen by a three-member professional staff, is hung. the museum will reopen to the public on july 22.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
A series of articles have been shared, each with varying claims and facts. 

The Jewish Museum in NYC is hosting a takeaway art exhibit featuring 400,000 artworks created by 40 contemporary artists. The exhibit was inspired by a similar show at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1995.

Artist Melinda Esparza's Tucson Artists' Open Studios Tour took place over the weekend, with visitors enjoying her paintings and talks with the show's curators.

The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum is restoring the Starship Enterprise model from the original ""Star Trek"" television series. The ship was launched in 1964 at a prop maker's shop in Burbank, California.

Caravaggio's 100 drawings dating to his youth have been discovered by Italian art experts. However, some question the authenticity of these findings due to the lack of peer review and publication in a respected art journal.

A message from ""The Iron Web"" audiobook has been shared, condemning state-worship and government crimes. The character's words are meant to be dramatic and should be considered within the context of the story.

Martin Grant's Spring/Summer 2016 collection was praised for its thoughtful composition and use of specific materials like linen-wool blend and silk organza feather tinsel.

These articles showcase a range of topics, from art exhibits to historical restorations, and raise questions about authenticity and credibility.

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
A series of articles discusses various cultural and artistic events. The Berkshire Museum is facing a lawsuit over the sale of Norman Rockwell's paintings, with plaintiffs arguing that the sale is financially unnecessary and antithetical to the museum's charitable purpose.

Meanwhile, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is relocating to Long Island City in Queens, New York, and will reopen on June 29. The new location features a collection of masterworks, including Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" and Picasso's ""Demoiselles d'Avignon"".

The National Academy has revised its policies after selling two paintings by Frederic Edwin Church and Sanford Robinson Gifford. The sale was part of a larger trend of museums deaccessioning their collections to address financial crises.

Local museums in Connecticut are tapping into big-city exhibitions, with the Bruce Museum staging an exhibition on oil sketches by Peter Paul Rubens that complemented a touring show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

The Schermerhorn Row, a row of brownstones on Fulton Street, was saved from demolition after a group of citizens fought for its preservation. A new maritime museum is being built between Front and South Streets, featuring walls that witnessed the city's vibrant maritime history.

In Brooklyn, two developers, William L. Crow and Francis Jencks, built nearly identical corner buildings flanking a row of brownstones on West End Avenue in 1897. The buildings feature red brick and limestone with distinctive broken pediments.

The use of substitute materials in historic preservation is a topic of debate. Some argue that faux parts are stronger, cheaper, and easier to maintain than original parts, while others worry that they can lose the texture of a substance and forfeit small but significant parts of a building's soul.

In Staten Island, plans are underway to redevelop the old Navy Homeport site in Stapleton, including building a 60-story Ferris wheel. The town was named after William J. Staples, who laid out its streets and established ferry service to Manhattan.

In Chicago, two steel and glass apartment buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe on North Lake Shore Drive are considered among the most influential structures of the 20th century. A new residential tower at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan is being designed by Frank Gehry.

city attacks black culture to erase blacks from san francisco (before it's news) bayview opera house executive director barbara ockel’s attack on black culture is to secretly promote gentrification and shipyard developer lennar’s political agenda this fence surrounding the remodeled opera house, replete with surveillance cameras and warning signs, makes it look more like a prison than a welcoming community center. the joe lee gym is at the right. the sidewalk just outside the fence at this spot is the place where, on july 16, 2011, kenneth harding, 19, bled to death after being shot by sfpd for not paying his $$2 t-train fare. the city has tried to erase all memory of that travesty. the movement to regain community control of the opera house demands the renaming of the adjacent mendell plaza, where he was shot, to kenneth harding plaza. another demand is the renaming of the parking lot at the back of this photo to keith perry plaza for the campaign by beloved community leader keith “kilo” perry to remove barbara ockel from control of the opera house. by kevin williams on oct. 2, 2017, a group of hunters point residents, including seniors, youth and disabled persons, appeared at a hearing of the full san francisco arts commission to protest excessive rents charged by executive director barbara ockel of up to $$4,000

Article 6 - we’ve got blinds
we’ve got blinds (before it's news) so, i bought blinds (from select blinds) for our kitchen and living room a long time ago. we kept meaning to put them up, but were much too lazy to actually do it. we actually did it this weekend, and we are very happy with them. as happy as you can be about blinds, anyway. after we figured out how to install them, it was pretty easy. i would mark the screw holes for the brackets, and shaun was in charge of drilling and mounting them. my job was clearly very important. i would also take many annoying photos of my husband while he was trying to do this. because our window stops were only an inch wide, we had to center the bracket on them and use the big square holes for the screws. is this ideal? i’m not sure, but that is the way it worked. once these were mounted, the blinds snapped in and the magnetic valance simply got stuck on. easy! i do have to mention that all the valance pieces were a quarter inch too short to cover the blind frame, so i will be contacting select blinds about it. pretty annoying. the color i chose for the blinds is pecan, it’s a nice warm color that looks great with our floors. blinds are pretty necessary in here, since our neighbors are about 15 feet away and the right window looks directly into our bathroom. we don’t always close the door all the way while in

architects eager to begin crystal cathedral’s renovation (before it's news) orange, calif., sep 26, 2013 / 04:16 am (cna/ewtn news).- the leading architects in the massive undertaking of renovating the ‘crystal cathedral’ into christ cathedral for the diocese of orange, calif., have expressed their excitement about the daunting project. on sept. 18, bishop kevin w. vann of orange announced that johnson fain and rios clementi hale studios had been selected to collaborate on the transformation of the landmark building and its 34-acre campus. the diocese of orange purchased the 3,000-seat crystal cathedral in february of 2012 from the protestant church which founded it. the purchase was made after crystal cathedral had filed for bankruptcy in october 2010 when some of its creditors sued for payment. “that the catholic church would take on a project like this, that they would be able to move to a site with this much promise in it, both in terms of the breadth of the site itself and the possibility of a campus of multiple buildings and multiple activities…is exciting,” scott johnson, design partner at johnson fain, told cna sept. 17. “and, that they would take on as the site of their cathedral, and in particular, the former crystal cathedral, which is quite an important landmark building…(the diocese)

(before it's news) it’s official. we are going to buy that schoolhouse in winlock, wa. providing it passes the inspections, of course. the septic has already been pumped and inspected because the property had a previous sale fail due to lack of funds. that just leaves the house and the well. we have looked the house over and i can’t see any issue that would cause it to fail. it seems to be structurally sound. it was built in the 30′s, when there was still pride in craftsmanship. it was a schoolhouse, so it isn’t fancy, but it is sturdily built. because it has a full basement we are able to see the beams and they are huge. this has been a stressful couple of weeks. we made our initial offer on the property back on dec. 27th. we are used to negotiating with individuals when buying a home. we start low. fannie mae doesn’t work that way. it is either a yes or a no. they don’t counter. after waiting a full 10 days our first offer was rejected. they were waiting to see if they got any other offers….and they did. we were then asked to make our last, best offer. this we did the very next day. that was this past tuesday. yesterday (friday) we got word of their preliminary acceptance of that second offer. we are now waiting to receive

Article 1 - two different developers gave block its character
photo q i live at 632 west end avenue. why are there two nearly identical corner buildings flanking a row of nearly identical brownstones? ... george moran, manhattan a why, indeed? for reasons unknown, the blockfront was sold for development in two segments in 1896. william l. crow bought almost all of the frontage — enough to build eight high-stoop row houses, running from 622 to 636 west end avenue and completed in 1897. but he did not get the corners, which were acquired at the same time by the developer francis jencks. he in turn retained the architect hugh lamb to build the double town houses at each end of the block, nos. 620 and 638. mr. crow’s architect, george f. pelham, followed convention in his choices for the brownstones, even though architects like clarence true had already popularized the low-stoop house. the pelham buildings are late examples of the high-stoop type. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. jencks waited until 1899 to build on the corners, and he put up town houses with an air of edwardian london, red brick and limestone, their rooftop dormers with distinctive broken pediments. clifford hartridge, who lived in the house at the 90th street corner, was a prominent lawyer, who served on the defense of harry k. thaw in the 1906

Article 2 - new body for a seaport's soul; at maritime museum's remade home, old walls talk
the new museum space, between front and south streets on fulton street, will offer salt-scented breezes and views of the harbor, and more important, walls and windows that were witnesses to the city's vibrant maritime saga. only yards from the schermerhorn buildings, with their handmade bricks and raked slate roofs, the first american ships sailed to china to open trade. whalers and packets arrived, as did boatloads of coffee, tea, molasses and, yes, immigrants. professor bender said the seaport was the place ''where immigrants got off the boat, and found employment, and even the most unskilled could get their shot.'' that influx of new americans, and the way of life of the working people of the wharves, will also be a focus of the new museum. ''we don't have the great collections of the historical societies uptown,'' mr. neill said, ''which are basically the heirlooms of the great families that no one wanted to keep. this museum is about the working people -- downtown, where the value was created. this is the beginning of the story. the uptown museums are the end of the story.'' schermerhorn row was saved after a group of spirited citizens fought for years against its demolition. they created the museum, which was chartered in 1967. the row and its block were declared landmarks in 1968 and incorporated, along with the museum, in the mall

Article 3 - the bionic brownstone
supporters say these substitute materials are stronger, cheaper and easier to maintain than original parts, and thus, paradoxically, encourage preservation. but critics worry that faux parts are often imperfect replacements for original materials, and that by allowing them, the city may be forfeiting small but significant parts of its soul. ''you end up losing the texture of a substance when you replace it with a new material,'' said simeon bankoff, the executive director of the historic districts council, a preservation group. ''and you have to ask, when does a building stop being what it was?'' it is a complicated issue, in part because it is not about something as heavy-handed as patching carnegie hall with asphalt siding. both sides want historic buildings preserved carefully and perceptively. and while the differences in their views are subtle, the stakes are high: the character and future of the built city. when the ancient romans repaired their chipped marble statues with wax, they didn't need municipal approval. new york is different, at least when it comes to noteworthy buildings. the city's landmarks preservation commission decides, case by case, what types of materials can be used on new york's 22,139 landmark properties and within its 82 historic districts. the commission, though cautious, has been fairly warm toward the new technologies and techniques. ''we're a little more progressive than the secretary of the interior,'' said brian hogg, the commission's director of preservation, referring to the

Article 4 - school moves to sell its middle-class housing
“this is not about individual fortunes,” said james paul, co-chairman of the trinity house tenants association. “this is about preserving affordable housing in the neighborhood.” the state mitchell-lama program was created in 1955 to encourage the construction of lower-income housing. developers agreed to charge below-market rates for rentals and co-op purchases in return for tax breaks and government-sponsored loans. after 20 or 25 years, owners are allowed to leave the housing program by paying off the low-interest mortgage. in recent years, with the rental market surging, many of them have done just that. in its own letter to trinity house tenants, the developer, pembroke properties inc., said that once the sale was complete, it would apply to withdraw the building from the mitchell-lama program and turn 161 of its 200 units into rent-stabilized apartments. (the school will retain ownership of 39 units now leased to some of its teachers.) the terms of the sale must be approved by the federal department of housing and urban development, which guarantees mortgages under the program, and the city’s department of housing preservation and development, which oversees 81 local mitchell-lama buildings, including trinity house. in a separate letter to elected officials, pembroke wrote that its ultimate goal was to convert the apartments at trinity house into condominiums, which would be offered to current tenants at a below-market price. tenants who could not afford to buy would

Article 5 - the brewer kings of staten island
even before hurricane sandy struck, the north shore of staten island called out for attention and appreciation. plans to encourage the local economy include building a 60-story ferris wheel near the st. george ferry terminal and, a short walk away in stapleton, redeveloping the old navy homeport site. but stapleton remains curiously trapped in its past, with remarkable buildings and an interesting if slightly down-at-heel commercial center. the town was named in 1836 for william j. staples, who laid out its streets and established ferry service to manhattan with his partner, a son of daniel d. tompkins, the sixth vice president of the united states. abundant local springs and a steep hillside perfect for “lagering” beer in caves attracted breweries; the largest of these was george bechtel’s, founded in 1853. photo old stables on van duzer street are all that remain of the brewery, but the grand houses on st. paul’s avenue recall the bechtel era. the meticulously maintained victorian at 387 st. paul’s avenue, built in 1888 as a wedding gift for mr. bechtel’s daughter, has not escaped notice by the “boardwalk empire” film crew. if you prefer your ladies unpainted, there are other houses nearby in a spooky, if romantic, state of dishevelment. a hike through the serpentine art and nature commons offers a clear

Article 6 - in chicago, more landmarks to live in
in downtown chicago, meanwhile, the premier ""starchitect"" buildings are 860 and 880 north lake shore drive, two steel and glass apartment buildings designed by mies van der rohe over a three-year period starting in 1949. the buildings, featured in architecture history books and often referred to as among the most influential structures of the 20th century, are perennial favorites with the city's creative community. ""it's like living in a museum,"" said james kinney, president of rubloff residential properties, a large downtown real estate brokerage firm. ""people either love them or hate them. but the fact that mies designed them is a definite marketing factor."" the tradition continues today with mr. jahn's project and another by the spanish architect santiago calatrava. both projects are in streeterville, a lakefront enclave. of the two projects, mr. jahn's is closer to completion. the condo building -- a striking 41-story curvilinear tower sheathed in glass and featuring amenities like an enclosed rooftop pool -- began construction in early march and is scheduled to be completed in 2008. the building has 227 units, at prices ranging from $330,000 for an 825-square-foot one-bedroom unit, to $2.3 million for a 3,200-square-foot penthouse. buyers have signed contracts and made down payments on three-quarters of the units.

Article 8 - a rare listing on fifth avenue

Title: streetscapes/19 gramercy park south; an 1880's house that asks, 'what's in a name?'
Content: up a sensuously modeled staircase, the second floor has a white-painted central room, with columns and unusual classical detailing -- early and elaborate for 1887, when american architecture was still in the thrall of the richardsonian romanesque. in 1979, mr. gill wrote in the new yorker that the fish house was designed by white, reflecting a strong oral tradition that the famed partner in mckim, mead & white was in charge. white's house -- no longer standing -- was just across gramercy park, at lexington avenue. the fishes' later house at 78th street and madison avenue was definitely designed by white. and mckim, mead & white did render a bill to the fishes for work on the gramercy park south house. but the internal records were marked, ''check to stratton.'' (most of the firm's surviving records are at the new-york historical society.) indeed, both the alteration permit at the department of buildings and the real estate record & guide, a trade journal, list the architect as sidney v. stratton, not mckim, mead & white. stratton is now a little-known designer, but he was one of the first american students at the ecole des beaux-arts in paris, along with h. h. richardson and richard morris hunt. after the ecole, stratton worked for hunt and went out on his own in the 1870's; he designed the queen anne style house & school of industry at 120 west 16th street, several country houses and the green alcove, a gemlike portion of an older room now at the new york society library at 53 east 79th street. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. mosette broderick, a lecturer in the urban design program at n.y.u. who has studied the work of both stratton and mckim, mead & white extensively, says that stratton met charles mckim at the ecole, sublet space from the firm in 1877 and developed an unusual arrangement from the early 1880's to about 1889. stratton was listed on the firm's letterhead, but underneath the partners' names, and separated from them by a line. mrs. broderick says that in the early 1880's, stratton was much better connected to new york society than were charles mckim, william mead or white -- that they used stratton to gain access to that world

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Historic buildings and neighborhoods in New York City are being preserved and redeveloped. The Schermerhorn Row, a row of brownstones on Fulton Street, was saved from demolition after a group of citizens fought for its preservation. A new maritime museum is being built between Front and South Streets, featuring walls that witnessed the city's vibrant maritime history.

In Brooklyn, two developers, William L. Crow and Francis Jencks, built nearly identical corner buildings flanking a row of brownstones on West End Avenue in 1897. The buildings feature red brick and limestone with distinctive broken pediments.

The use of substitute materials in historic preservation is a topic of debate. Some argue that faux parts are stronger, cheaper, and easier to maintain than original parts, while others worry that they can lose the texture of a substance and forfeit small but significant parts of a building's soul.

In Staten Island, plans are underway to redevelop the old Navy Homeport site in Stapleton, including building a 60-story Ferris wheel. The town was named after William J. Staples, who laid out its streets and established ferry service to Manhattan.

In Chicago, two steel and glass apartment buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe on North Lake Shore Drive are considered among the most influential structures of the 20th century. A new residential tower at 8 Spruce Street in Lower Manhattan is being designed by Frank Gehry.

(before it's news) the most important thing the president said about the republican budget in his big speech tuesday was when he described just some of the damage it does, and said, “this is not an exaggeration. check it out yourself.” seriously, do that, and see if you can get your friends, relatives and especially your right-wing bother-in-law to do it, too. seriously. republicans counting on “low-information” voters the secret of the republican technique is that they count on lots of people being tuned out, apathetic and largely uninformed. they put up a lot of misinformation and smoke and mirrors and diversion and distraction, often claiming that what they are doing is the opposite of what they are doing, to trick people into accepting what they are doing, or at least not taking action to stop them. another thing they do is accusing the other side of doing what they themselves are doing, as “cover.” (it’s called inoculation.) they won the majority in the house by running ads telling seniors that democrats had cut $$500 billion from medicare, and a majority of seniors voted republican for the first time. now in office they are not just cutting medicare, they are privatizing medicare, phasing it out for those now under 55. they are using another inoculation tactic to mask what they are doing

Article 5 - renewed government attack on private property – why fear this?
renewed government attack on private property – why fear this? % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) one of the things that perpetually frightens me about america is the unreasoning ability of our people to continually wave off things that are right in our faces – to just believe in the better side of people – even politicians. “they wouldn’t do that to us – it’ll never last” or “that’ll never pass”. right. remember health care? one of the newest versions of this is the cap and trade bill which is supposedly scrapped, though senate leader reid stated that postponing the bill didn’t preclude him from bringing it back. trying to talk to farmers every day about this sledgehammer heading for their heads is frustrating because they believe the mainstream media when they quote the first half of reid’s statement about postponing the bill, but not the second part of his statement about bringing it back. sound familiar? it should. how many times were we told about the death knell of health care? now we have this spectacular initiative of the government to continue to expand their control over land in america. this is to “protect the special places”. one thing i didn’t know until i saw an article by michelle malkin on cns news where she hit me in the head with an astonishing fact: the government controls 1 out of every 3 acres in this country. why is this

(before it's news) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_r_v9cybpy while millions of americans spend half their lives or more toiling for a paycheck, millions more are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the government to issue them their next monthly distribution. you’d think that emergency funds or government subsidization through programs like welfare would be used to help recipients purchase the things that they need to get by and help them get back on their feet so that they can find meaningful labor and contribute to society, but in a system without cross-checks and billions being dished out year-after-year, many have learned that they don’t need to work. and why should they? you’re doing the work for them in the form of taxpayer subsidies that are deducted from your earnings on a weekly basis. in america, those who work get punished. those who don’t, get a free ride, courtesy of a nationwide policy of spreading the wealth around through confiscation and redistribution. case in point: a welfare recipient in austin recently contacted a morning radio show and explained that she gets a lot of money from the program. what she does with it may (or may not) surprise you. here’s how your hard earned money is being used to help the less fortunate: more… source: http://

Article 1 - don’t look down
that mirrors the serial uncertainty on the opposite side of the atlantic, where the united states congress, inept at so very much, excels at catastrophic scenarios and suffixes. it has mastered the -mageddon. “taxmageddon,” as it’s sometimes called on capitol hill, is the new biggie, looming early next year. that’s when, in the absence of congressional action, supposedly temporary tax cuts passed under george w. bush and extended by president obama expire as automatic spending reductions agreed to at the end of the debt ceiling showdown (“debtmaggedon”) begin to kick in. the combined force of those developments, according to some projections, would be a $700 billion blow to the economy in 2013 and, as the year progressed, a recession . photo the current issue of time magazine not only outlines this doomsday scenario and discusses how kick-the-can lawmakers have “manufactured an irrational cataclysmic event,” but also enshrines “fiscal cliff” as the phrase of the week. the times, for its part, presented “fiscal cliffs notes,” explaining that economic growth could slow by 3.6 percentage points next year if democrats and republicans can’t reach an agreement that yanks us back from the brink. they probably will. when they finally must. which is months away. no reason to rush! certainly not if the pace of progress in this case mimics the movement (or lack thereof

Article 2 - text: obama’s state of the union address
so i know the anxieties that are out there right now. they're not new. these struggles are the reason i ran for president. these struggles are what i've witnessed for years in places like elkhart, indiana; galesburg, illinois. i hear about them in the letters that i read each night. the toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work. for these americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. some are frustrated; some are angry. they don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on wall street is rewarded, but hard work on main street isn't; or why washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. they're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. they know we can't afford it. not now. so we face big and difficult challenges. and what the american people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, democrats and republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. the aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their

Article 3 - bernie sanders rails against donald trump’s infrastructure ‘scam’ | the huffington post
bernie sanders rails against donald trump’s infrastructure ‘scam’ “trump’s plan is corporate welfare coming and going.” 11/22/2016 04:54 am et rebecca shapiro senior editor, the huffington post sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) called out president-elect donald trump ’s plan on infrastructure, labeling it a “scam” and “corporate welfare.” in an article posted to medium on monday , the senator said trump rightfully promised to improve america’s infrastructure while on the campaign trail, but the president-elect’s plan has fallen short on that promise. “trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes. and then he would allow the companies to ‘invest’ in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks,” sanders wrote. “trump’s plan is corporate welfare coming and going.” sanders added that he planned to reintroduce in january his policy calling for a $1 trillion investment over five years to rebuild america’s roads, bridges, water systems, railways, airports, levees and dams, which he unveiled last year. “unlike trump’s plan, which creates new tax loopholes and is a corporate giveaway, my rebuild america act would be paid for by eliminating tax loopholes that allow hugely profitable multinational corporations to stash their profits in offshore tax havens around the world,” he wrote. trump has cited

Article 5 - arshad warsi gets trolled for tweet targeting narendra modi on demonetising rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes
arshad warsi is not happy woth prime minister narendra modi’s move as prime minister narendra modi scrapped rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes starting november 9, people have gone into a frenzy. the decision was so sudden that people had no time to manage their cash flow. while many call it a bold move against corruption and black money, there are others who acknowledge that the first few days could be troublesome because banks and atms will run out of cash. while a lot of people from the film industry have lauded the pm’s move, actor arshad warsi doesn’t seem so happy. in a series of tweets, he lashed out at pm modi asking him to make new laws and amend the older ones that doesn’t allow fraudulent companies to function at all and increase the number of tax payers in the country. “@narendramodi sir please enjoy your chair but please stop using the honest tax payers as your foot rest.” he tweeted. “a fraudulent company is allowed to do business by the govt & the innocent tax payer has to pay the price. where is the justice” he wrote in another tweet. people on twitter didn’t take his opinion on the matter too well and trolled him massively. “if you were an honest tax payer you wouldn’t have felt like a foot rest,” wrote a user. later, with a pinch of sarcasm, warsi tweeted, “sir,you have

Article 6 - it’s the big questions that slow growth
simply promising not to raise taxes wouldn’t be helpful. the american people are wise enough to understand that wishing won’t make the problem go away. the only way to resolve this fundamental uncertainty is to enact a credible long-run deficit reduction plan that shows what spending will be cut and what taxes will be raised, once the economy returns to full employment. the release of the report of the president’s bipartisan deficit commission on wednesday was an important step, but it is unclear whether the administration and congress will embrace the recommendations. wall street analysts often cite possible government regulations on the environment as another source of damaging uncertainty. but as with the deficit, inaction could be far more damaging than action. climate change and dependence on foreign oil are problems that won’t go away on their own. tabling plans to deal with them doesn’t make it easier for companies to plan and invest; it makes it harder. photo until businesses and communities know the costs and incentives for developing renewable energy, nuclear power and natural gas — and whether we will address climate change through prices or direct regulation — it will be very hard to invest in new power sources and related industrial technologies. the deepest and most destructive uncertainty we face centers on the overall health of the economy and its prospects for growth. unlike other postwar recessions that were caused by tight monetary policy and high interest rates, the recent downturn resulted from the bursting of a housing bubble and a financial crisis. because we are in largely uncharted territory, figuring out how and when

Article 7 - tax overhaul to be unveiled this month may be less than advertised
for its part, the trump administration is moving full speed ahead as the president rushes to secure his first significant legislative achievement. speaking to reporters aboard air force one on thursday, president trump repeated that a detailed plan would be unveiled the week of sept. 25. he also said that because of economic growth it would not add to the deficit and that some democrats were likely to back it. “i think it’s going to be something that’s going to be very successful, and i do believe we’ll have some democratic votes,” mr. trump said. mr. trump also reiterated what he said earlier this week, declaring that the tax plan would not benefit the wealthiest americans. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. “this is not a plan for the rich,” mr. trump added. most analyses of mr. trump’s tax plans and the proposals produced by republicans have disproportionately benefited the rich, and mr. trump’s suggestion this week that they could pay more has left many tax experts scratching their heads. steven mnuchin, the treasury secretary, explained on thursday that even if the top individual tax rate does go

Article 8 - the tax wilderness, untamed
but the changes last year were not entirely straightforward — and certainly weren’t part of a comprehensive overhaul. they did not merely raise taxes for higher-income people; they also made filing more complex. single people with at least $250,000 in adjusted gross income — the threshold for married couples is $300,000 — were hit by new curbs on personal exemptions and on many popular deductions, such as those for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions. on top of those changes came the tax increases of the affordable care act, billed as a way to pay for president obama’s health care law by tapping the pockets of the well-to-do. individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 saw an additional medicare contribution tax of 0.9 percent on wages and self-employment income. and an additional tax of 3.8 percent on investment income — interest, dividends, royalties, annuities, capital gains, rents and income from passive business activities — will be calculated on whatever is less, net investment income or gross income above the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold. there were other changes, too. a total of 55 tax breaks expired — at least for now — including one that allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in out-of-pocket costs for school supplies. a deduction for tuition and fees vanished, as did credits for installation of some energy-efficient home improvements. of course, congress could reinstate

Article 3 - how women’s sports are affecting the future of competition
how women’s sports are affecting the future of competition (before it's news) female participation in international sports has been on a significant increase for some years now. does increasing female participation in sports portend anything more significant for the nature of competition in both female and male sports? to find out the answer, it is important to examine participatory trends and what might occur as more of those women take on influential positions in athletics after their own playing careers are over. this summer, for the first time ever, more female athletes than male represented the united states at the summer olympics. the american delegation was 52.6% female—292 out of 555 participants. four decades earlier, in 1976, the female representation on the american summer olympics team was only 29.8%, and 20 years ago, in 1996, it was 41.9%. one likely reason for this steady increase is title ix, which since 1972 has provided more female athletes with sports training opportunities through prohibiting discrimination based on sex in any educational program that receives financial aid. admittedly, not all female olympians train at educational institutions, nor could title ix alone explain why women have increased as a percentage of the olympic delegation at a steady rate of over 10% for the past four decades. yet, one could hardly expect that by 2020, this pace will continue so that well over 60% of the team will be female. so how will

(before it's news) by selwyn duke it’s difficult to say if the greatest drama of the 2012 olympics has occurred inside or outside the athletic arena, but it’s hard for anything to compare to the controversy that recently surrounded 16-year-old chinese swim sensation ye shiwen. the story started on saturday when ye shattered the women’s world record in the 400-meter individual medley in a time of 4:28.43, beating the old mark by more than a second. if a second constitutes a “shattered” record—and it does at that high level—you can only imagine what a 14 or 23-second difference is: it’s a vast ocean away. so it should surprise no one that those also happen to be the number of seconds ye was slower than, respectively, the last finisher in the men’s 400m im, and its winner, ryan lochte. but you wouldn’t know it from the reportage, which, fueled by ye’s anomalous final leg of her race, seemed content to rank race times like bowling scores. for instance, the first part of a daily mail headline read, “ryan lochte may be speedy…but this 16-year-old chinese girl is even quicker!” the guardian had a subtitle stating “chinese 16-year-old swam faster than ryan lochte,” while drudge jumped the shark with “faster than any man!” not surprisingly, such reporting left many readers—including

Article 1 - putin says doping sanctions devalue rio olympic medals
the international olympic committee was urged by athletes and antidoping officials to bar the entire russian team after an investigation confirmed a pervasive state-sponsored doping scheme. but olympics officials instead chose to defer that decision to individual sports federations. mr. putin promised that russia would treat the barred athletes as olympic champions, “with all the administrative and financial consequences this entails.” photo in january, the russian government ruled that gold medalists in rio de janeiro would receive 4 million rubles each, or $60,000. yelena isinbayeva, a pole-vaulter who is among the track and field athletes barred from the games, could not hide her tears in her speech that followed mr. putin’s. “they took from us the goal that had kept us going and motivated us to keep pushing our own limits every day,” said mrs. isinbayeva, two-time olympic champion and the current world-record holder in pole vault. “today we faced such lawlessness, injustice and complacency from certain people in the sports world, who do whatever they want under the rules that they created themselves.” following the meeting, russian athletes went to one of the kremlin’s ancient cathedrals, where patriarch kirill i, the head of the russian orthodox church, conducted a farewell service. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story sign up for the sports newsletter get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from times journalists

Article 2 - turbine potsdam still powers women’s soccer
hundreds of fans gathered tuesday night at the team’s 40th-anniversary party on the shore of templiner lake outside potsdam. there they watched germany defeat france, 4-2, in the world cup, with the first goal coming off an assist by turbine’s own babett peter. they listened to the power ballads of the pop singer ute freudenberg, who defected to west germany in 1984 but is now back in the former east. the biggest cheers of the night, however, were for the 68-year-old coach and athletic director, bernd schröder, who read that note back in 1971 and volunteered to coach the team. he has been with turbine ever since, with the exception of a one-year suspension by communist officials for letting his squad play teams from the west. photo “it’s unique in world history and cannot be repeated,” schröder said tuesday, a week after receiving the federal cross of merit, the highest civilian award in germany. “you don’t get a penny for it,” he said about the medal. “i won the activist of socialist labor six times and got 250 marks for each one.” the joke is that schröder has worked these past 40 years without taking a salary from the team. he earned his living until retirement as an engineer at the plant. a tall, charismatic coach with a deep voice, schröder is the symbol of the

growing up in williamsport, pa., zaq harrison watched on television as his boyhood idol, the swimmer mark spitz, won a seventh gold medal, then a record for one olympics. the israelis were abducted the next day, propelling harrison on a continuing reassessment of heroism. a finance professional from baltimore, he recently began summer camp discussions about the munich olympians and the ethical issues athletes face. harrison, 48, informs children that the israeli wrestling coach moshe weinberg and the weight lifter yosef romano gamely fought the 1972 terrorists. he displays single white placards, each bearing a munich name, inviting the teenage campers to recite them. he always reserves berger, a world-class jewish athlete, for last. harrison said he admired berger because he “figuratively lifted all of us on his shoulders” into a german arena a generation after the holocaust. “i’ve gotten 2,000 kids to say the names out loud,” harrison said. “it’s a different learning experience.” jed margolis attended berger’s rival school, cleveland heights high school. “david’s was a name we all knew and looked up to,” said margolis, 61, the executive director of the united states branch of the international maccabi movement, which promotes jewish pride through sports. “he was the ultimate student

Article 4 - freestylers are uptight about keeping clothes loose
“i think there is a need for a rule” about what can be worn in a race, said holland, 31, of sandpoint, idaho. the international ski federation, known as fis, has created rules regulating what can be worn in ski cross and snowboard cross competition at world cup events and the olympics. but the rules for snowboard cross are not well defined: suits must be two-piece and speed suits are not allowed, but, according to kathrin hostettler, an fis spokeswoman, there is no rule for measuring how tight they are. photo this has forced snowboarders to self-police. when holland sees a fellow competitor wearing snug clothing at the starting gate, he will usually offer a gentle reprimand. but others have begun to resort to harsh words. “i’ve seen other riders get heated up on it,” holland said. “there definitely is backlash if you show up with something tight.” during the early 1990s, big-mountain free skiers organized ski cross. snowboard cross followed, populated by former freestyle riders. as a group, they had a loose vibe and loose outerwear. “they were very antiestablishment and they were very anti-race suit,” said casey puckett, who qualified to compete for the united states ski team when ski cross makes its olympic debut next month, but who will miss the winter x games with a shoulder injury. “it was extremely important to them

we’ll find out soon. at the same time, athletes will be winning medals. but will anyone notice? never before has the pre-olympic chatter been less about the athletes or the sports. and never before has the conversation leading to the games been so grim: suicide bombers have struck volgograd, about 400 miles north of sochi, three times since the fall — including strikes in december that killed at least 34 people. global security experts have called this the most dangerous games ever, based on the location of the competitions, the seriousness of the threats (including one from the head of a terrorist organization who last summer lifted a moratorium on civilian targets), and the capability of terrorist groups to carry out their plans (several in that region already have). “it was a very, very risky decision for the olympic committee” to hold the olympics in sochi, said andrew c. kuchins, the director and senior fellow of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic & international studies, a security think tank in washington. he basically said what is on the minds of many people headed to the games, and the many people — including athletes’ families and friends — who were too scared to attend. photo what was the international olympic committee thinking? seven years ago, the i.o.c. awarded the 2014 winter games to sochi, making it the first subtropical host of the winter olympics

fifa confirmed that the 2022 world cup in qatar would be played in the winter, announcing thursday that its governing executive committee had set the date of that year’s final for dec. 18. the move away from the summer months to winter had been expected for years. almost immediately after awarding the world cup to qatar in 2010, top fifa officials, including the president, sepp blatter, acknowledged that playing the event in the searing heat of the gulf summer was unworkable, and unwise. while the final is now set, it remains unclear when the tournament will begin. the 2014 tournament in brazil lasted 32 days, and the 2018 world cup in russia is scheduled at the same length. a similar timetable in qatar would put the world cup opener around nov. 17, though fifa officials suggested thursday that a 28- or 29-day schedule was under consideration. few in soccer disputed the need for a move away from the summer once fifa declared that there was no chance qatar would lose the right to host. the problem was finding an open window on the calendar. advertisement continue reading the main story any move out of the summer would upset fifa’s richest stakeholders, most notably the european leagues and federations that would see their lucrative league and cup seasons interrupted and the united states media companies like fox, which will have to broadcast the tournament during the heart of the american football season

cooking: from full-time job to hobby (before it's news) chelsea follett a wealthy manhattan woman died after her clothes caught fire while cooking last week. her tragic death was unusual, but there was a time when cooking was far more dangerous and time-consuming. even today, more than 4 million people lacking modern stoves die prematurely each year from breathing in cooking fumes. not only was cooking once unsafe, it left time for little else. as professor deirdre mccloskey once noted, “[in] 1900 a typical american household of the middle class would spend 44 hours [a week] in food preparation,” and most of that work fell to women. in other words, back in the days of churning one’s own butter and baking one’s own bread, food preparation took up the same hours as a full-time job. that estimate includes time spent on purchasing, cooking and serving food as well as dishwashing. keep in mind that in addition to cooking, women were also often responsible for cleaning the home, laundry, mending clothes, and tending to children. things started changing quickly. in 1910, u.s. households spent approximately six hours daily cooking meals, including cleanup; by the mid-1960s (when more reliable estimates began), that fell to one and a half hours. by 2008, the average low-income american spent just over an hour on food preparation each day and the average high-income american spent

Article 1 - an alternative for latke lovers
why is it that there are eight days of hanukkah and only one really traditional holiday food, at least in this country? sure, i’ve read all about what other cultures eat in “the book of jewish food” by claudia roden. the israelis savor doughnuts, the hungarians, cheese pancakes. the sephardim nosh syrup-soaked fritters and the italians deep-fried chicken. but here in the states, it’s the latke that most jews will fry this weekend, letting the grated-potato cakes turn golden and crisp before slathering them with sour cream or applesauce or both. being a documented latke lover, i’ll do my own time with the vegetable grater at least twice during hanukkah. but that leaves me wondering what to make on the other six days. advertisement continue reading the main story as long as it’s fried in olive oil to commemorate the miracle of 165 b.c. (when a day’s worth of oil burned for eight), almost anything goes. but i wanted something other than doughnuts, fritters or chicken — a dish unfussy enough to throw together on a weeknight. photo naturally, i thought of grilled cheese. i could fry a sandwich in olive oil, and all the children who might show up for the holiday would surely be pleased, mine included. but plain grilled cheese just didn’t seem festive enough for the adults.

Article 2 - reaching across the ages for breads to warm the soul
in the realm of culinary activities, baking is the most personal. we might cook out of duty but when we bake, we bake out of love. and for most of us, that love needs a mentor. fortunately, there is maggie glezer. ms. glezer knows that baking recipes are best understood within the context and traditions they call home. she also knows that baking is a science, requiring precision and skill, awareness and understanding. many forms of cookery have adjustment valves and reset buttons; baking does not. ms. glezer's first book, ''artisan baking in america'' (artisan), brought a regimen of small-scale professional recipes and techniques -- the magic of cool fermentation, low doses of yeast and the principle of autolyse (a brief early rest to make yeasted doughs compliant) -- into home kitchens. she offered a crash course in tactile education and gave home bakers a feel for soft, sticky doughs and a taste for bread with a big, open crumb and shattering crust. these weren't just favorite recipes: they were a collection that reflected the range and rewards of an american movement toward bread baking as an artisan craft. in her new book, a blessing of bread (artisan, $35), ms. glezer reaches across the jewish diaspora to bring us bread recipes and traditions from eastern europe, the mediterranean, north africa and the near east. to compile this book, ms. glezer interviewed and worked alongside dozens of jewish b

Article 3 - the english lose their cool
this passionate turn by britain — actually, england and wales; if northern ireland and scotland could, they’d stay put — is not particularly surprising. the passion is not only about europe, and it’s not entirely new. the warming of the english sang-froid has been going on for some time. photo i first noticed a growing propensity for the english to overindulge their feelings in the wake of the death of diana, princess of wales, in 1997. the composure of the funeral guests was in stark contrast to the behavior of the crowd outside westminster abbey: emotional, bereft, even distraught. there were not only tears, there was hugging. london was not london that day, it was rome or naples; it wore its heart on its sleeve, like new york. it was an unrecognizable city, its nerves frayed, sharing its grief. it was the first proof, to my eyes, that the english were losing their imperturbability. the funeral was an inflection point, but it wasn’t a beginning. it merely highlighted changes that had been underway for decades. when i first encountered england as a student, it seemed that, aside from the few who took part in the swinging ’60s and ’70s, the english didn’t know how to have fun. but that soon began to change. they ventured abroad on vacation. long before the global public took notice, english

Article 4 - the chef alex atala reveals surprises in store for danish food conference mad4
how has the role of chef changed in the culture? we have never had the voice we have now, and we are learning how to use that for good. many of us have worked in kitchens our whole lives with the goal of becoming head chef without having the time to expand our education. everyone who is going to mad knows how to cook, but we invite people from other disciplines who might help us understand an aspect of what we do in a different way. mad is an opportunity for chefs to push out the boundaries of the kitchen and explore new ways to be a chef. have any ideas explored at mad had a real application in the world? sure. as an example, we have the first mad, when i introduced the subject of eating insects. it was something quite new at the time, especially in the fine dining world. since then the idea has been well accepted and insects are much more commonplace. they have even been categorized as food by the united nation’s food and agriculture organization. there is an international festival circuit that often features many of the same faces. has there been an effort to diversify that this year? we are going to surprise people with new names, even if they are shining stars in their own world but maybe are unknown in the culinary world. producers, artists, scientists, people who work in social justice. we are also looking at some young chefs who might be a surprise and important in the future. many conferences can be focused only on the existing big names, and that

Article 5 - almost-traditional jewish cooking
photo living in new york, a spiritual homeland of the delicatessen, i have certain pavlovian responses to the phrase ‘‘jewish food.’’ i sniff around for the scent of fatty fish and smoke. i clutch my supply of lipitor and fiend for a corned-beef sandwich bigger than my child’s head. i assume everything that is yellowish and disc-shaped is a fried potato pancake until proved otherwise. but itta werdiger roth has some other ideas about what jewish food is. raised in an orthodox jewish community in australia, she married an american, moved to new york and became a supper-club impresario, hosting dinner-and-a-show gatherings in her ditmas park living room — raucous evenings of kosher food, cocktails and, say, an all-woman hasidic rock band. she’s not the most traditional jewish cook you’ll ever meet, but who is, really? ‘‘so much of jewish food here is really just american,’’ she said to me. ‘‘before i came to the u.s., i’d never heard of eating latkes with apple sauce. i’d never called a matzo ball a matzo ball, and i’d never seen what we call knishes here.’’ as she described her own produce-driven cooking, joking that her grandmother thought a single pickle was a meal’s worth of vegetable, it occurred to me that with food traditions it’s easy to assume that what your grandmother ate was the same

Article 6 - fads aside, the perfect macaron is timeless
with the french economy spiraling downward, with pessimism infecting france like black mold, la patisserie (the pastry) has risen in importance. “is la pâtisserie going to replace sex?” screamed the headline of an article in the magazine marianne this spring. but the article was not about macarons. in paris, hardly anyone talks about macarons. the battle for the palates of the french seems to be elsewhere. madame figaro magazine announced recently that “the cream-filled puff pastry has replaced the macaron.” and the styles supplement of the weekly magazine l’express declared the éclair the winner, having “rendered the macaron old-fashioned.” of course none of this matters to mr. génot, the baker of the classic macaron, which i sampled from the parchment paper on a tray still warm from the oven. it was crisp on the outside and moist and soft in the middle, with just enough chew. it took me back to buffalo, to the pignoli, a sicilian version of macarons studded with pine nuts that my aunt lili made in huge batches at christmas. like mr. génot, she kept her recipe secret, not by withholding it, but by slightly altering proportions of the ingredients in every retelling. “ours are the originals, the macarons of the french revolution,” said mr. génot, who runs maison des soeurs macarons (house of the macarons

Article 7 - perfection? hint: it’s warm and has a secret
the first visit was to the city bakery, on west 18th street, owned by maury rubin, who seems to get as much pleasure from talking about food as from eating it. when asked about the secret to his cookies, he said, “we bake them in small batches every hour so they’re always fresh.” he went on to say that the store sells more than 1,000 cookies a day. why, then, does almost everybody say they prefer homemade to bakery bought? mr. rubin smiled, having already figured out the answer. “it’s the warm rule,” he said. “even a bad cookie straight from the oven has its appeal.” it’s an opinion expressed by every baker visited. jacques torres , who has three branches of his jacques torres chocolate in manhattan and brooklyn, has a small warming tray set up near the register so customers can get their cookies soft and gooey, although he offers them at room temperature, too. seth berkowitz, the owner of insomnia cookies on east eighth street, goes so far as to have a display case filled with baskets spilling over with stand-in cookies; the real deals are sold straight from a holding oven. heather sue mercer, one of three sisters who own ruby et violette, which recently reopened on west 50th street, believes that her bakery’s basic chocolate chip cookie “is definitely better warm,” but, she said, “i think some of our

Article 8 - thanksgiving tv: plan your other binge
your tv snob aunt photo “the leftovers” (hbo go) i recommend this series not simply because it has the most thanksgiving-appropriate title on television. it’s also, for all its metaphysical weirdness, a story about family and loved ones. one oct. 14, two percent of the world’s population vanishes — poof, suddenly gone, with no discernible pattern. we don’t know why or how, and the series seems determined not to explain. instead, it focuses on the survivors — the “leftovers” of the title — and the strategies, from nihilism to cults, they rely on to make sense of life after “the sudden departure.” the first season, set in suburban new york, was haunting but uneven. (pressed for time? at least watch the premiere and the standout episodes “guest” — showcasing the phenomenal carrie coon — and “the garveys at their best,” which flashes back to the departure.) the rebooted second season has been astounding, as kevin garvey (justin theroux) and his troubled family move to jarden, tex., the lone town that claims to have lost no residents on oct. 14. this is heavy stuff, but at two seasons, it’s the perfect mini-binge; start now and catch up in time for the season 2 finale on hbo dec. 6. if you’re a fan of thoughtful drama, you won’t want to be left

Title: a growing challenge for germans who live by bread alone
Content: the shift in culture is so worrying to bakers like mr. trefzger that they are taking extraordinary steps to raise the awareness of germans, and the world, to the uniqueness of their threatened baking traditions. they are reaching out to young people via social media in an effort to attract more of them to the job. last year, the german bakers’ association even applied for the country’s baking tradition to receive special recognition and protection by adding it to the unesco list of cultural heritages, where it would gain a spot alongside french cuisine and croatian gingerbread. so far, however, none of those steps has reversed the seemingly inexorable decline of the german bakery. last year, the number of german bakeries dropped 3.6 percent. only 13,171 now remain in a country of about 80 million people that six decades ago counted more than 55,000 bakeries in the former west germany alone. in the past seven years, the number of young people training to become bakers has dropped by a third, to 26,535 in 2013. that is a long fall for german culinary tradition, more commonly associated with sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes. yet from the days of charlemagne until the end of the previous century, a staple of the german diet was thick, hearty slices of sourdough-leavened bread made from grains like rye or spelt. the german word for supper, “abendbrot,” means “evening bread.” “until the 1960s, bread served as the central source of nourishment in germany,” said peter becker, president of the german bakers’ association. “people would even make a cross on the bread as a sign of thankfulness. that significance has been lost.” like many traditional bakers, mr. trefzger came to his profession through his father, who instilled in his son the passion for his craft. but, mr. trefzger said, many parents no longer want to see their children enter a profession with such grueling hours — craft bakers usually begin mixing dough for the next day’s bread just after midnight — often discouraging even those who show an interest in baking. sweden 150 miles denmark north sea poland hamburg berlin neth. germany belg. czech rep. france schopfheim austria switz. then there is the convenience of modern, mass-scale food production, which has enticed germans as it has people in other industrialized countries. it can be hard to compete with. siegfried brenneis, 48, a certified baker and pastry chef from the village of mudau and a member of an elite group of german bakers who take part in international competitions, said supermarket bakeries had allowed discounters to attract customers through what he called “aroma marketing,” the pretense of handcrafted breads and

11279.0,fake,reliable,0.9,111.68665647506714,False,"The article best matches the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, as it accurately describes a historical event (the Christmas Truce of World War I) and provides context about the war's progression. There are no significant contradictions between the article and the facts mentioned in the summary. The article also supports claims made by the summary, such as the involvement of various colonial conscripts and the static nature of the Western Front. The only discrepancy is a minor one: the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY mentions President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas the article actually refers to President Trump (although this seems to be an error in the summary). Overall, the article's content aligns closely with the facts presented in the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, making it a reliable source of information.","A series of articles discuss various topics, including historical events and current global issues. 

The Christmas Truce of 1914 is highlighted as a brief moment of peace amidst World War I, revealing the greed of those in power rather than an irreconcilable difference between nations. This event serves as a reminder that knowledge is power and that individuals should take control of their own destiny.

A man from Tennessee expresses uncertainty about dating a French woman due to France's skepticism towards US actions, particularly regarding the Iraq invasion. He questions whether things have returned to normal after the war.

News updates cover various global issues, including the UK's consideration of leaving the EU, the euro crisis in Spain, and concerns over food shortages worldwide.

A warning is issued about the potential for a catastrophic event in London, with powerful forces seeking to destroy the city. The author emphasizes the importance of preserving the UK's AAA rating and warns against unleashing hyper-inflation in Russia.

The history of cause and cost leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis is examined, highlighting two economic assumptions that have failed to address the issue: mercantile globalism and neoliberal capitalism.

Finally, a guest contributor discusses the threat of another European war, citing warnings from prominent German politicians who signed a letter stating ""war in Europe again? not in our names!"" The author emphasizes the importance of understanding historical events and avoiding similar mistakes in the future.","Historical events and stories from various articles are summarized as follows:

In 1914, a Christmas Day truce occurred between British and German soldiers on the Western Front, with reports of an impromptu soccer game in no man's land. This event is still remembered today as a message of hope and humanity.

The United States' entry into World War I was debated among politicians and citizens, with some advocating for neutrality and others pushing for intervention. President Franklin D. Roosevelt played a key role in educating the public about the need for action against fascism.

In Dresden, Tennessee, families affected by military service are being supported by local leaders, who are working to ensure that those left behind receive necessary assistance.

Refugees fleeing Europe's migration crisis are facing dire conditions, with many seeking safety and protection. The global economy is also experiencing fluctuations, with some countries struggling to maintain growth.

Armistice Day was commemorated in Britain and France on November 11, with millions observing a two-minute silence to honor those killed in World War I. The event marked the end of fighting on the Western Front.

A European identity remains elusive for many Italians, who feel culturally connected but not politically aligned. The continent is experiencing a growing divide between its northern and southern regions.

Pope Francis has spoken out about the need for reflection and change, particularly regarding hardness of heart and indifference towards those in peril. He has also denounced abortion and expressed concern for displaced Christians in Iraq.

The Battle of Britain was a critical event in World War II, with the British preparing for war in the skies and the Germans failing to deliver a knockout blow. The decisive point of the battle is still debated among historians.

These events highlight the complexities and challenges faced by individuals and nations during times of conflict and social change.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 1 - the christmas truce of 1914 – pinhole of light among a nightmare of madness
(before it's news) (tony cartalucci – ld) in the end, we have more in common with the furthest flung foreign common man than the closest corporate-fascist that presumes dominion over our lives. during the early 1900′s, europe was locked in the first world war. millions would perish – tens of thousands in a single day. on one brief occasion, a pinhole of light shined through this utter madness, revealing the truth of this man-made nightmare. the men in the trenches were being driven toward each other, not by some irreconcilable difference they had with one another, but by the greed of those ruling elite residing in their respective homelands. if only the british and germans realized it was the greed of their own banking houses and industrialists that had them in the trenches and not some irreconcilable difference amongst themselves… knowledge is power, ignorance literally can mean death. when will we start being leaders in our homes, communities, counties, and provinces – driving our own destiny rather than being driven? shall we look upon the christmas truce of 1914 with wonder a century on, or look toward it as evidence something was and still is tragically wrong with human civilization and work this next year with renewed vigor to resolve it?

Article 2 - man wants to date french woman, unsure if it's okay yet :: the enduring vision
man wants to date french woman, unsure if it's okay yet paul stuwart, a tennessee resident, recently met a woman of french nationality whom he is ""pretty sure"" he is interested in romantically. however, there is a catch. ""she's french,"" he explained, ""and so i don't know if i can rightly date her yet, as an american citizen."" france's position concerning the u.s. invasion of iraq -- which could be referred to as skeptical at best -- was a viewpoint that angered many americans, including stuwart. ""we saved their asses in the past,"" he said scornfully, ""so therefore they should be completely in support of every single decision we make from now until the end of time. it's just common courtesy."" due to the ill-will towards france felt by many, matters of a french nature were often touchy subjects once the war began, such as french fries being renamed to ""freedom fries"", and ""frenchmen"" being renamed to ""stupid fucking faggot men"". but many are quick to point out that although similar feelings of animosity and frivolous renaming of products occurred with germany during world war ii, things eventually returned to normal. stuwart's question, therefore, is simple: have things returned to normal yet?

hitchins and booker in tune (before it's news) peter hitchins and i share the same sort of parents; we are the children of those who were very young adults the last time that we were cursed by war; he writes today in the mail it seemed fairly clear to me from her experiences that war had in fact been a miserable affair of fear, hunger, threadbare darned clothes, broken windows and insolent officials. and that was a victory, more or less, though my father (who fought in it) was never sure of that. if anyone really is trying to punish the russian people for being patriotic, by debauching the rouble, i cannot imagine anything more irresponsible. it was the destruction of the german mark in 1922, and the wipeout of the middle class that resulted, which led directly to hitler. stupid, ill-informed people nowadays like to compare mr putin with hitler. i warn them and you that, if we succeed in overthrowing mr putin by unleashing hyper-inflation in russia, we may find out what a russian hitler is really like. and that a war in europe is anything but fun. quite one of the oddest and most frightening stories of the year has been the ludicrous and persistent misrepresentation in the west of the reason for the tragic shambles unfolding over russia and ukraine. this has been presented as wholly the fault of the russian “dictator” vlad

global soccer tale of 1914 christmas day truce is inspiring, though hard to believe image a re-enactment of the reported no man’s land soccer game between players dressed in british army and german army uniforms. credit stephanie lecocq/european pressphoto agency london — the christmas truce, when british and german soldiers were said to have suddenly stopped fighting on the western front for a few hours on christmas day 1914, is written in history. what started with the singing of “stille nacht” on the german side, followed by a response of “silent night,” was said to have included an impromptu soccer game on the no man’s land between the opposing trenches. “we all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms on christmas day when gunfire gave way to gifts,” prince william said at a ceremony in england two weeks ago to unveil a memorial to the event. “football,” the prince continued, “has the power to bring people together and break down barriers. it is vital that 100 years on, we keep the christmas truce story alive. it remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times.” hope and humanity and perhaps, ultimately, futility. soccer is a remarkable game that crosses boundaries around this world. but whatever took place on that day a century ago did not stop the carnage that took an estimated 16 million lives, nor did

Article 2 - the world: a matter of debate; building national resolve by talking about it
in congress and within the cabinet, isolationists critiqued wilson's version of neutrality, sponsoring resolutions on capitol hill forbidding americans to enter the war zone on ships flying any colors but the stars and stripes. meanwhile, opposition voices in congress, the diplomatic service and the press pushed war. theodore roosevelt denounced wilson as a ''time server,'' without courage. by the time wilson sought a declaration of war, in april 1917, the nation had considered the stakes and costs of intervention. opposition remained but congress and the public rallied behind the president. franklin d. roosevelt understood even better than wilson the need to take his case for overseas intervention directly to the nation. facing a far more perilous world situation and a nation so hostile to foreign entanglements that congress had adopted neutrality laws forbidding the traffic with belligerents that had led america into world war i, roosevelt knew what problems ''a large misinformed public opinion'' could produce. so he began a sustained effort to educate the american people and build support for the battle against fascism. in 1937, roosevelt traveled to chicago, a hotbed of isolationism, to deliver his famous ''quarantine the aggressor'' speech. ''war is a contagion,'' he warned. isolation or neutrality could not protect the united states: ''there must be positive endeavors to preserve peace.'' in 1939, as europe plunged into war, ro

dresden's mayor, danny forrester, said that if the 1174th's families, deprived of their breadwinners, fall behind on the water and sewer bill, the city will postpone or forgive it. if they need a handyman, he will send somebody out.

""november 11 marks the memory of the first world war and of a rising wave of nationalism that could not be contained. we must continue to remember it,"" hollande said. in britain, offices, schools and city centers fell silent while in trafalgar square in central london, traffic came to a halt, with crowds invited to put poppy petals in the square's famous fountains. prince harry, queen elizabeth's grandson who himself served with the british military on two tours of duty in afghanistan, led commemorations at a service at the armed forces memorial at the national memorial arboretum in central

Article 6 - what is a european
in april, romano prodi, an italian and the current president of the european commission -- the european union's executive body- criticized the british for defensiveness and timidity with regard to playing their ''full part'' in europe, while they behaved (in a comparison he excised before he gave the speech) like the tiny back wheel of a penny-farthing bicycle in the ''special relationship'' with the states. but i have not detected any strong sense of european identity among italians i know. one wrote in answer to my question that, after seeing the restored frescoes of piero della francesca in arezzo, she felt culturally european, ''even if probably i feel more italian.''

“so many men and women immersed in worldliness and indifference” are affected by hardness of the heart, he said, calling for reflection and change. and he chided the vatican’s bureaucratic machine in another address this week for losing touch with its spiritual side in the pursuit of power. as christians exchanged gifts and shared family meals, the pope’s thoughts were with the world’s dispossessed, refugees and exiles, those suffering “brutal” ethnic or religious persecution and those held as hostages or killed because of their religious beliefs. “truly there are so many tears this christmas,” francis said from the central balcony of st. peter’s basilica before thousands of faithful in the square below. the address was also broadcast live on the internet. photo to underscore his closeness to those suffering religious persecution, a theme of his nearly two years as pope, on christmas eve, francis spoke with displaced christians who are in a tent camp in northern iraq and told them that they were like jesus. many in the camps have been forced to leave their homes by militants of the islamic state. “you are like jesus on the night of his birth when he had been forced to flee,” the pope told them in a telephone call broadcast live by an italian catholic television station. “you are like jesus in this situation, and that means we are praying even harder for you.” the pope also denounced abortion, and his thoughts turned to “infants killed in

Article 8 - fighting in the air
any new history of world war ii must clear a high bar to distinguish itself from the competitors that fill the shelves of libraries and bookstores. as our so-called greatest generation fades away, its memory appears better preserved than that of any other cohort of combatants in modern history, thanks to hundreds (if not thousands) of popular histories, memoirs, scholarly and military treatises dissecting the period and its players. michael korda’s “with wings like eagles,” his new volume on the battle of britain, clears this hurdle in a modest way, by stepping back from the minutiae of the clash between the royal air force and the luftwaffe in 1940 to focus on the truly critical events that determined the outcome. the book soars in those parts in which korda describes how the british prepared for the war in the skies, or how the germans failed time and again to deliver a knockout blow. determining the decisive point of any battle is the quintessential challenge of wartime command. the great military leaders have possessed a preternatural ability to see through the fog of war, as von clausewitz described it, to find that moment and marshal their forces at precisely the time and place, and in precisely the right manner, to prevail against an enemy attempting to do exactly the same thing. in the late 1930s, britain’s politicians and generals could see war over the horizon. after watching german and italian forces advance into parts of europe and africa,

Title: the christmas truce of world war i
Content: the christmas truce of world war i headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! in august 1914, europe’s major powers threw themselves into war with gleeful abandon. germany, a rising power with vast aspirations, plowed across belgium, seeking to checkmate france quickly before russia could mobilize, thereby averting the prospect of a two-front war. thousands of young germans, anticipating a six-week conflict, boarded troop trains singing the optimistic refrain: “ausflug nach paris. auf widersehen auf dem boulevard.” (“excursion to paris. see you again on the boulevard.”) the french were eager to avenge the loss of alsace and lorraine to germany in 1870. the british government, leery of germany’s growing power, mobilized hundreds of thousands of young men to “teach the hun a lesson.” across the continent, writes british historian simon rees, “millions of servicemen, reservists and volunteers … rushed enthusiastically to the banners of war…. the atmosphere was one of holiday rather than conflict.” each side expected to be victorious by christmas. but as december dawned, the antagonists found themselves mired along the western front – a static line of trenches running for hundreds of miles through france and belgium. at some points along the front, combatants were separated by less than 100 feet. their crude redoubts were little more than large ditches scooped out of miry, whitish-gray soil. ill-equipped for winter, soldiers slogged through brackish water that was too cold for human comfort, but too warm to freeze. the unclaimed territory designated no man’s land was littered with the awful residue of war – expended ammunition and the lifeless bodies of those on whom the ammunition had been spent. the mortal remains of many slain soldiers could be found grotesquely woven into barbed wire fences. villages and homes lay in ruins. abandoned churches had been appropriated for use as military bases. as losses mounted and the stalemate hardened, war fever began to dissipate on both sides. many of those pressed into service on the western front had not succumbed to the initial frenzy of bloodlust. fighting alongside french, belgian, and english troops were hindus and sikhs from india, as well as gurkhas from the himalayan kingdom of nepal. these colonial conscripts had been transported from their native soil and deployed in trenches carved out of wintry belgian cabbage patches. highland scots were also found at the front, proudly wearing their kilts in defiance of the bitter december cold. the german troops were led by elite prussian officers, representatives of the bellicose junker aristocracy. the german rank and file included bavarian, saxon, westphalian, and hessian reservists, more than a few of whom had lived – or even been born – in england and

Article 3 - memphis drops confederate names from parks, sowing new battles
the dispute has grown, with the ku klux klan planning to march through memphis on saturday, even as historians and religious leaders selected by the council search for replacement names. photo the council chose temporary names that members said would not offend anyone: memphis park, mississippi river park and health sciences park. mayor a. c. wharton said reaching a compromise would be difficult. he angered confederate groups last week by proposing that a statue of ulysses s. grant be erected to create balance and honor the union troops. “these are the growing pains of a democratic society,” mr. wharton said. “this is the south, remember. traditions don’t die that easy.” memphis, where 63 percent of the residents are black, is the latest city to grapple with the delicate issue of confederate names and monuments. in selma, ala., a bust of general forrest was attacked with cinder blocks and vandalized with graffiti before disappearing last year, and the city decided to block a confederate historical group from replacing it. in florida and tennessee, public schools named for general forrest have faced protests and petitions to rename them. the renaming of the memphis parks on feb. 5 came in anticipation of a bill, since passed by the state legislature and now awaiting action from gov. bill haslam, that would make it harder for local governments to change the names of any parks or monuments honoring wars or war

Article 4 - fund-raising obstacles imperil n.y. bid for ’08 democratic convention
it was not immediately clear whether officials would pull back from the bid or devise a new fund-raising strategy, but the financial issue is dampening what had appeared to be encouraging developments as new york pushed aggressively to serve as host to the democrats in 2008. from the beginning, few political analysts greeted new york’s attempt to snare the convention with much optimism, arguing that democrats would be wiser to go to an area of the country where they stood to sway a few fence-sitting states to their side, instead of choosing a state that has long been in the democratic camp. but aides to mr. bloomberg put together an all-out pitch, promising to decorate the entire city, provide delegates with concierge services and offer the news media free spa treatments and haircuts at barneys to help them “get excited about their environment,” according to a host committee presentation. mayor bloomberg even traveled to chicago to court democrats, taking along the “sopranos” star lorraine bracco as aides doled out big apple martinis and manhattans to party leaders. then, new york’s effort got a surprise shot in the arm from an unlikely source: the republicans, who snapped up minneapolis and st. paul, which, like new york, had bid for both conventions. that put the twin cities out of the running for the democratic convention, since both events are scheduled just days apart. further strengthening new york’s chances was the sense among democrats

Article 5 - petitions call for steve bannon’s ouster from trump’s white house
several organizations have launched petitions calling for to rescind his appointment of breitbart news chairman steve bannon. these pleas for trump to reconsider his sunday decision to select bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor focus largely on bannon’s prominent role in the so-called alt-right movement, which critics call a mere rebranding of white nationalism. bannon’s defenders say the left is trying to smear both him and trump after losing the election. but his detractors accuse him of transforming breitbart news into an online news destination for racism, sexism, xenophobia, conspiracy theories and hate. they consider it unacceptable that a man responsible for fanning the flames of racial division is on track to be one of the country’s most powerful and influential men. moveon.org, a liberal political action committee, launched a petition urging members of congress to vehemently oppose trump’s appointment of bannon and use any tools at their disposal to keep this from happening. it had more than 187,000 signatures as of wednesday morning. but it’s not clear how much congress could intervene. unlike cabinet secretaries and those in other high-profile positions, advisers like bannon are not subject to senate approval. jo comerford, a campaign director for moveon.org, told yahoo news that bannon’s “unabashed white supremacist, misogynist, anti-semitic leanings” and the “bigoted vein” of trump’s campaign have no place in the white house. view photos steve

see all 13 stories protesters trying to push past a long-blocked bridge on a state highway late sunday and early monday were turned back by authorities using tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses. at least 17 protesters were injured severely enough to be taken to hospitals, said dallas goldtooth, an organizer with the indigenous environmental network. “hypothermia, a number of head injuries from being shot with rubber bullets, one individual had a heart attack,” he said. daniel kanahele, 64, a native hawaiian who joined the protest last week, said he was hit with tear gas, water spray and a rubber bullet in a leg, and “it took me off my feet.” he was treated at the scene but said many other protesters suffered more serious injuries. although goldtooth said a water cannon was used to douse the protesters, morton county sheriff’s spokesman rob keller denied that. keller said a tactical vehicle spraying tear gas has been mistaken by some people for a water cannon. keller did confirm that water hoses owned by the mandan rural fire department were used to put out fires set by protesters and to turn back protesters during a violent clash that was “rapidly unfolding.” “water hoses were used to keep distance between officers and criminal agitators and also to put out fires set by those agitators,” he said. goldtooth said the fires were set to warm people soaked with water. he criticized authorities’ use

the council has one black member, whose term is not finished, and the city is assured of gaining a second after april 7. mr. smith, a retired factory worker, is running against wesley bell, 40, a lawyer and municipal judge, who is also black. running for local government is rarely glamorous, and at this moment in ferguson, it seems especially unappealing. the next council members will face enormous pressure and scrutiny during their three-year terms, all for a job that pays a $250 monthly stipend. they will need to reach accommodation with the justice department, which this month called for sweeping changes in the city’s police and courts in an effort to end discriminatory law enforcement. they will need to find a new city manager and police chief, all the while under the eyes of political activists and media from around the world. on friday, a group of residents began a formal effort to make another substantial change in the city’s government, seeking a recall of mayor james knowles iii. photo but there will be opportunity, too: a chance to install an entirely new management team, to revamp policing practices and to take a bigger role in guiding ferguson than councils have in the past. the candidates said they were running precisely because the stakes were so high. mr. smith and mr. bell’s ward on the south side of ferguson includes the canfield green apartments, where mr. brown was shot, setting off a national discussion about race and policing. the

",0.8
6190384.0,fake,fake,0.8,88.04636549949646,True," The article and the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY do not align well, but they also don't have any glaring contradictions or inaccuracies that would make it clear-cut as FAKE NEWS. However, several red flags indicate that the article is likely FAKE NEWS.  Firstly, the article contains unsubstantiated claims about Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and the US Department of Energy's dependence on foreign energy. These claims are not supported by credible sources and seem to be exaggerated or fabricated.  Secondly, the article makes a sweeping statement about China buying up US oil and gas deposits, which is not a verified fact. While it is true that China has invested in US energy projects, there is no evidence to suggest that they have acquired significant amounts of US oil and gas reserves.  Lastly, the article's tone and language are sensationalized and emotive, with phrases like ""people who i get the impression want me, my family and my friends dead"" and ""handed over to opec, many of whose members are our confirmed enemies."" This kind of rhetoric is often associated with FAKE NEWS articles.  Overall, while the article may contain some factual information about oil prices and US energy policy, its tone, language, and unsubstantiated claims make it more likely to be FAKE NEWS.","Key points from the articles:

* Saudi Arabia has overstated its oil reserves by 40% (300 billion barrels), according to Wikileaks.
* The US Department of Energy has increased dependence on foreign energy, contributing to the country's reliance on Middle Eastern oil.
* Oil prices are expected to rise due to increased demand and reduced supply, potentially reaching $14 per barrel or higher.
* China is allowed to buy up US oil and gas deposits, contradicting efforts towards oil independence.
* The US has a history of exporting refined oil products, but not crude oil, which is essential for the country's energy needs.
* The global economy is heavily reliant on oil-based currencies, making it vulnerable to price fluctuations.
* Middle Eastern chaos and conflicts are expected to drive up oil prices, potentially reaching $4 per gallon.
* The US has a history of relying on foreign energy sources, including Saudi Arabia, which has led to concerns about national security and economic stability.

These points highlight the complexities of the global energy market, the impact of Middle Eastern conflicts on oil prices, and the US's reliance on foreign energy sources.","Key points:

* High gasoline prices in the US are causing concern, with some suggesting alternative energy sources and increased production from non-OPEC countries.
* Saudi Arabia is a major oil producer and has significant investments in the US, including the Port Arthur refinery.
* OPEC's production levels are being discussed, with some members considering cuts to supplies.
* The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve should not be used to control market prices, as it can create artificial shortages.
* Sterling is rising due to speculation about a potential Brexit and Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
* Oil price fluctuations have an impact on inflation rates, with different scenarios predicting varying effects.
* The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has shifted from a priority for the US to a ""hobby"" for diplomats.
* Energy revenue accounts for over half of Russia's government budget.

These points highlight key issues and trends in the articles, providing a concise summary of the main topics discussed.",8,8,"RetrievalConfig(k=8, ce_model=None, ce_model_name='cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2', diversity_type='mmr', verbose=False)","system: You are a careful fact-focused assistant.

Article 3 - could oil go to $$14 per barrel?
could oil go to $$14 per barrel? (before it's news) how about $$14 per barrel oil? that is a possibility according to abigail doolittle founder of peak theories research on-line research firm dedicated to providing investors with a technically-inclined view on the financial markets and the economy. she is a contributor to cnbc meaning that she has some credibility. she is a market technician which means her analysis is confined to past chart behavior not the fundamentals of the oil market. a compelling case can be made that given enough time a technician can find a chart to fit about any circumstance and the circumstances in the oil market are becoming more unique by the day. still, doolittle cannot be dismissed out of hand albeit her super bearish prediction is an outlier. a barrel of oil contains 42 gallons meaning that the per gallon price of crude would be 33 cents meaning after refining and distribution costs plus federal and state taxes gasoline would still be below $$1 per gallon. parenthetically a barrel’s refined products include about 20 gallons of gasoline, 12 gallons of diesel and 4 gallons of jet fuel and other products like liquefied petroleum gases and asphalt but the outputs can be changed to meet market requirements such as the need to produce more heating oil in the winter months. assuming that saudi arabia continues to run pedal to the metal all bets are off. storage and refining capacities are finite. the law of supply and demand does not always function in the short term

wikileaks: oil reserves in saudia arabia off by 40%! (before it's news) when i read this article at zero hedge, my stomach lurched and the hairs on my arm stood up. wikileaks reveals today that saudi arabia has overstated oil reserves by 300 billion barrels. the peak oil proponents have warned us that it was entirely possible that saudi arabia production had peaked and now it appears that it is true. the cables, released by wikileaks, urge washington to take seriously a warning from a senior saudi government oil executive that the kingdom’s crude oil reserves may have been overstated by as much as 300bn barrels – nearly 40%.” saudi arabia has been the “i got your back,” the backup, the country that could provide the oil at the margin to keep oil prices stable. this no longer seems to be true. no longer is there a way to stop the global rise in oil prices and china is stockpiling oil for its own needs. expect oil prices to take out $$100 soon and expect 6000 things made from oil to increase in price, including gasoline. why this country isn’t doing everything in its power to find new domestic reserves is nuts. the u.s. dept of energy has increased our dependence on foreign energy and the whole program is insane! read more at mover mike source:

answer to milt farrow, or, stop being stupid part seven (before it's news) by anna von reitz some americans–at least the ones i consort with— know that the petro dollar was engineered by kissinger because we are consistently the top exporter of refined oil products in the world and always have been. (get a clue: we are also the main supplier of guns and weapons and “defense supplies and materials”. we never re-tooled our industries for peace time after world war ii. we kept right on chugging out the same old crap and developing new versions of it and promoting wars for profit all over the world.) other americans think that we are in constant dire need of oil and can never get enough oil—– and don’t make the distinction between crude oil —- the raw material that we can’t get enough of, and refined oil products— which we can’t offload fast enough. beyond paying for part of the nasty government operations none of us approve of, none of this has anything to do with arabs buying treasury bonds. arabs do that because they figure that treasury bonds are a good safe place to store the value of their money, and as long as the world has an oil-based economy, they are right. when big oil goes down as a result of new technology being released all those who have depended on the value of oil to back-stop their currencies and foreign trade markets, most especially the us and russia and the middle

distress of nations in the last days!

oil soars on middle eastern chaos % of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. (before it's news) ummm…this isn’t good(/cl is oil futures for those of you that don’t use think or swim): my take: i hope you folks filled up your gas tanks over the holiday weekend. gas is going to go up sharply if the middle east continues going “mike tyson” crazy. imo, $$4 gas is the tipping point for the consumer, and we are rapidly closing in on this number as i type. gas sat at around $$3.40 when i hit the pump today. the markets are going to be interesting tomorrow. stock futures are down sharply. on the flip side, food futures, gold, and silver are all soaring as the world sinks into total chaos. what’s scary is it’s not just the middle east we have our own version of “egypt” over here in the beautiful state of wisconsin. who woulda guessed that the crap would start hitting the fan there first? it’s comical watching this whole charade. the unions look like a bunch of clueless little spoiled brats. weaning the unions off of the government “teet” is going to be a very painful process. sadly these people don’t understand that it’s got to happen because the money isn’t their to pay for their 100k per year pensions. the state unions are bunch of morons, and

Article 1 - saudi arabia, you're fired!
donald j. trump has had it with high gasoline prices -- and if it were up to him, we just wouldn't put up with it any more. in his blog on the site of trump university (donald j. trump, chairman), he voices outrage at the ''horrific milestone'' of americans paying as much as $3 a gallon (about half what they pay in europe, but never mind) and states flatly, ''that's just ridiculous.'' he makes a nod to a partial solution (we should ''get on the ball with alternative energy''), but he saves his true magisterial indignation for all this pussyfooting with saudi arabia. ''just threaten to stop protecting'' those oil-producing countries, he said, and watch prices plummet. but the real solution, of course, is alarmingly simple: call off those wimpy politicians. ''send a true business leader,'' he writes, ''someone who is used to tough bargaining.'' after some ''serious talking,'' he vows, ''those prices would drop like a rock -- guaranteed.'' hmm. does he have someone in mind? hubert b. herring

Article 2 - saudi threat to sell u.s. assets could hurt, but mostly the saudis
however, a sell-off could be self-defeating for saudi arabia. the port arthur refinery highlights the cost of pulling back. the refinery is owned by motiva enterprises, a joint venture between royal dutch shell and saudi aramco, the state-owned oil giant. aramco has a long history of investing in the united states, in part to facilitate the sale of saudi oil to american consumers. last month, aramco announced a deal to take full ownership of the refinery, along with a network of 26 distribution terminals and the rights to sell fuel under the shell brand name across a large swath of the united states, including texas. the saudis might be able to sell the refinery, but they would lose a strategic investment. “for a producer that big, you have to be in every market in the world to place your oil,” said elizabeth rosenberg, director of the energy, economics and security program at the center for a new american security. aramco also invests in technologies, including the $10 million stake in nanomech in arkansas, announced last week, and part ownership of at least eight other small american companies. there is no comprehensive public accounting of the saudi government’s investments in the united states, although american officials say $750 billion is a plausible figure. photo and the single largest chunk of that money is probably invested in treasury securities. the treasury department says a group of 15 “oil-exporting

Article 3 - saudi minister says opec should not curtail production
""most probably there is no need to do anything to the ceiling or the level of production,"" mr. naimi of saudi arabia said after arriving in kuwait for monday's meeting. ""we will do our best to maintain reliable and secure supplies to the market, as usual,"" he said. the group pumps some 30 million barrels a day, including about 1.8 million barrels from iraq. most members are producing at full capacity, except for saudi arabia, which still has some unused potential. some ministers suggested that opec might decide on monday to call for a meeting in january, ahead of its planned gathering in march, to discuss possible cuts in supplies before the start of the second quarter. the idea of an early meeting was raised by the kuwaiti minister and backed by the representative from qatar. ""i'm always concerned about the second quarter,"" abdullah bin hamad al-attiyah, the oil minister from qatar, told reporters. ""because you see today, there is more oil in the market and hopefully this oil will not reflect negatively in the second quarter."" ""demand for oil always drops drastically in the second quarter,"" he added, ""so we have to be cautious and learn from the lessons of the past."" producers outside of opec are expected to add as much as one million barrels a day of new supplies next year, with another 500,000 to 1 million barrels coming from opec countries.

Article 4 - the hard reality of oil
to the editor: re your feb. 10 editorial ''the high price of oil'': the administration should not release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to control market prices, even under a system of ''swaps.'' if opec wants to increase the price of oil, it will do so regardless of whether or not the reserve is used. this is the reality of being dependent on foreign oil supplies for more than 50 percent of our energy needs. in fact, george w. bush's call for pressing opec to increase production may be the best strategy. if feasible, oil production should also be increased from countries outside opec to offset the cutbacks. as a long-term strategy, our government should continue to support the american oil companies' search for oil throughout the world. whatever the outcome of this crisis, we americans must realize that it is not our right always to enjoy cheap energy. ultimately, we will have to pay more. the arab oil embargo of 1973 proved that to us. mark purcell montclair, n.j., feb. 10, 2000 the writer was a petroleum geologist, 1983-89.

Article 5 - sterling soars on trump jitters and brexit hopes | business
speculation that the uk could avoid a hard brexit from the european union, and fears that donald trump might snatch a last-minute victory in the race for the white house, have helped sterling register its biggest weekly gain against the us dollar in seven years. the pound’s respite from its recent heavy falls on the foreign exchanges continued on friday when it put on a cent against the us currency to trade at $1.2558 – its highest level for four weeks. sterling’s rally came despite labour market data from the us , which strengthened wall street’s belief that official borrowing costs in the world’s biggest economy will be raised before christmas. currency dealers paid less interest than usual to the 161,000 increase in non-farm employment last month and the 0.4% increase in hourly earnings, focusing instead on the knife-edge battle between hillary clinton and trump for the presidency. pound graph the pound has been rising since the start of the week after evidence of a narrowing of clinton’s opinion-poll lead and amid evidence from forward-looking business surveys that the uk economy was set to grow robustly in the fourth quarter of 2016. sterling then received a double-boost on thursday when the high court ruled that the government could not trigger article 50 to leave the eu without the approval of parliament , and the bank of england announced that it had abandoned plans for a second post-referendum stimulus . “we’re seeing a bit of a relief rally now that

Article 6 - oil’s swift fall raises fortunes of u.s. abroad
iran has been hit so hard that its government, looking for ways to fill a widening hole in its budget, is offering young men the option of buying their way out of an obligatory two years of military service. “we are on the eve of a major crisis,” an iranian economist, hossein raghfar, told the etemaad newspaper on sunday. “the government needs money badly.” venezuela, which has the world’s largest estimated oil reserves and has used them to position itself as a foil to american “imperialism,” received 95 percent of its export earnings from petroleum before prices fell. it is now having trouble paying for social projects at home and for a foreign policy rooted in oil-financed largess, including shipments of reduced-price petroleum to cuba and elsewhere. photo amid worries on bond markets that venezuela might default on its loans, president nicolás maduro, who was elected last year after the death of mr. chávez, has said the country will continue to pay its debts. but inflation in venezuela is over 60 percent, there are shortages of many basic goods, and many experts believe the economy is in recession. but the biggest casualty so far has probably been russia, where energy revenue accounts for more than half of the government’s budget. mr. putin built up strong support by seeming to banish the economic turmoil that had afflicted the rule of his predecessor, boris n. yeltsin. yet russia was back

Article 7 - mr. obama goes to israel
in case you haven’t heard, president obama leaves for israel next week. it is possible, though, that you haven’t heard because it is hard for me to recall a less-anticipated trip to israel by an american president. but there is a message in that empty bottle: little is expected from this trip — not only because little is possible, but because, from a narrow u.s. point of view, little is necessary. quietly, with nobody announcing it, the israeli-palestinian conflict has shifted from a necessity to a hobby for american diplomats. like any hobby — building model airplanes or knitting sweaters — some days you work on it, some days you don’t. it depends on your mood, but it doesn’t usually matter when that sweater gets finished. obama worked on this hobby early in his first term. he got stuck as both parties rebuffed him, and, therefore, he adopted, quite rationally in my view, an attitude of benign neglect. it was barely noticed. the shift in the israeli-palestinian conflict from necessity to hobby for the u.s. is driven by a number of structural changes, beginning with the end of the cold war. there was a time when it was truly feared that an arab-israeli war could trigger a wider superpower conflict. during the october 1973 war, president nixon raised america’s military readiness to defcon 3 to signal the soviets to stay away

Article 8 - does a link remain between inflation and oil prices?
many economists would argue that there is a complex relationship between oil prices and inflation, comprising of many differing factors. there seems to have been a calming of that connection since the peak of the oil crises in the seventies, which saw rocketing oil prices noticeably hiked inflation, but some patterns still remain and are envisaged between oil and consumer prices. midway through 2014, the cost of a barrel of crude oil began to fall, and a study last year by economist alejandro badel and research associate joseph mcgillicuddy for the federal reserve bank of st louis, revealed simulations of different paths of inflation. if oil prices rebounded to $100 per barrel in the first half of this year, inflation would jump to 4.5 percent, and then fall to around 2 percent in june next year. alternatively, if the cost of oil remained static at the current spot price of $52 per barrel at the time of writing, then inflation would jump up to 3 percent in january this year, then be reduced back to the 2 percent mark by midway through next year. conversely, if prices were to fall to $20 per barrel, then the consumer price index would fall to a minus 1 percent level, eventually settling at 2 percent in june 2017. all three scenarios point to a shock effect of oil price fluctuation, which eventually settles down into an even path. the reality is that, through a year of volatile oil prices

Article 1 - here are the key levels in gold & gold miners
here are the key levels in gold & gold miners headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the rally in gold and gold mining stocks easily surpassed our expectations and targets. the strength has been far more than we anticipated. the gold stocks blew past their 200-day moving averages while gold blew past $1300/oz. now it is time to take a technical look and focus on the key support and resistance targets. the strength of the rebound pushed the miners well beyond their 200-day moving averages and to their june and october highs. gdx is consolidating just below $24 while gdxj is consolidating just below $35. if this consolidation turns into a correction then gdx and gdxj could find support at their 200-day moving averages which are at $22.71 and $33.37 respectively. as you can see, should gdx and gdxj be able to exceed recent peaks then they could rally towards important resistance levels. those are $25.50 for gdx and $38 for gdxj. the rally has been just as strong in gold as it surpassed resistance in the $1300-$1310/oz zone. gold closed the week at $1322/oz. should gold pause or correct here then the sellers could push the market down to previous resistance but now current support at $1300-$1310/oz. trendline resistance will come into play near $1340/oz while the

(before it's news) in the summer of the 2011, a rare set up was in place in the gold and swiss franc markets. at the time the power of the pattern shared that gold should be “down for years to come.” see why we shared this near all-time highs in gold (here) since that post, the metals complex … source: http://blog.kimblechartingsolutions.com/2016/01/gold-testing-multi-year-breakout-level/

Article 3 - market technician jordan roy-byrne’s charts predict precious metals will outperform
market technician jordan roy-byrne’s charts predict precious metals will outperform (before it's news) the gold report: since november, there’s been a decisive break between the s&p 500 and gold, bullion and the amex gold bugs index (hui:nyse). the hui has provided leverage to gold, but it’s been leverage to the downside. there are new highs on the s&p 500 almost daily. does that mean that you’re looking for new lows in mining equities? jordan roy-byrne: there’s been a negative correlation between precious metals and the equity market that became quite pronounced in november. however, the negative correlation really began in the summer of 2011, when gold peaked at $$1,900/ounce ($$1,900/oz) and the hui gold stock index and market vectors gold miners etf (gdx:nysearca) also peaked. the negative correlation is in place over a long period and not necessarily over a day-to-day or week-to-week period. the precious metals complex has likely bottomed due to extreme bearish sentiment. in the near term, i think a move higher in the s&p 500 could be speculative and actually benefit mining shares before the larger correlation comes back into play. many investors forget history. everyone is focused on what happened in 2008. there were times in the 1960s through the 1980s, during that bull market

Article 4 - obama tax cuts will push investors further to gold
obama tax cuts will push investors further to gold (before it's news) the full version of our analysis (with comments particularly valuable for precious metals traders) is available to our subscribers. starting january, american workers will start to see changes in their paychecks as the social security tax break that was signed into law last friday takes effect. workers normally allocate 6.2% of their wages to social security on the first $$106,800. this will be reduced to 4.2%. the social security tax cut is just one part of the package that was passed. additional measures include extending benefits for the long-term unemployed and passing a lower tax rate for inheritance above $$10 million (from the proposed 45% to 35%). the inability of obama’s administration to collect higher taxes will pose a long-term challenge to the american economy. the government seems incapable of understanding that printing more money while reducing tax collection is a recipe to default. this mistake will have repercussions in a lot of ways, possibly even precipitating another meltdown that is worse than 2008 crisis. unilateral financial “incentives” to the american public can turn into disincentives on the longer term. the future generation will be encumbered by a debt burden that is growing exponentially every year. although mainstream news reports rosy statistics, this means nothing. in-depth research will reveal that on the state, county, and municipal level, the us is edging towards bankruptcy. even some of the wealthiest

Article 5 - breakout or no breakout, short-term correction appears likely
breakout or no breakout, short-term correction appears likely (before it's news) based on the july 19th, 2011 premium update. visit our archives for more gold & silver analysis. in general, gold market overview appears mixed according to pm investors and it is obvious. some say gold has miles to travel, other suggest gold may take a pause before next journey and some others say it’s time for gold to fall. debates continue in blogosphere. recently, one of our subscribers has sent us a link to an online article about gold being ready to drop to $$1,320. this article claims there will be a decline in the price of precious metals in the second half of 2011 and that the proliferation of gold etfs will make the drop especially violent. the author argues that the recovery will be a long, hard slog over the coming years, rather than runaway growth and inflation or catastrophic collapse. with neither the bulls’ nor bears’ extreme scenarios proving accurate, the logic behind owning gold seems suspect. the author concludes that barring a sudden dramatic shift in economic circumstances, such as a strong oil spike or major sovereign default, we favor a drop in gold prices over the coming six months. in looking at the prevalence of investors and the ease of use of gold etf’s, we also expect that any significant sell-off will be particularly strong and violent. we expect to see spot gold trading below $$1320 by the end of the year. summing up,

Article 6 - gold & gold stocks nearing a big move
gold & gold stocks nearing a big move (before it's news) gold and especially gold mining stocks rebounded on wednesday and trended higher into the weekend. this is giving some investors renewed hopes that the bull market that began roughly 18 months ago is about to reassert itself. we cannot know for sure yet but what we can say is precious metals are nearing a big move. gold and gold stocks have traded in tight ranges which will compress further while volatility indicators approach multi-year lows. this is the setup for a break and then a powerful move with increasing momentum and volatility. first let’s take a look at gold. its weekly bar chart is shown (going back 10 years) with two volatility indicators at the bottom. one is the gvz contract and one is the average true range (atr) indicator. the atr indicator is at a 10-year low while gvz is near an 8-year low. gold has tested major resistance ($$1300) twice and failed both times. if gold loses its 2017 uptrend (support is around $$1230) then it is susceptible to an accelerated decline with increasing volatility and momentum. on the other hand, if gold could bust through $$1300 and then consolidate around $$1350, it could setup that anticipated breakout through $$1350-$$1375. turning to the gold stocks, we plot a 10-year bar chart of gdx along with the atr indicator and the bollinger band width for two

Article 7 - gold market update
– posted sunday, 30 january 2011 | share this article| source: goldseek.com a rare and exceptional opportunity has just presented itself to enter this precious metals bullmarket at very favorable prices for gold, silver and especially for precious metals stocks – right at an intermediate bottom. that is what our latest studies indicate. while gold dropped a little lower last week than expected in the last update, it has arrived in an area of strong support above its rising 200-day moving average in a deeply oversold condition, as we can see on its 8-month chart below. thus it is interesting to observe that a bullish candlestick pattern, known as a “piercing pattern”, appeared on its chart on thursday and friday, which frequently signifies a reversal. the downturn in gold and silver has not unnaturally brought bears out of hiding, and they of course are to be found in large numbers near market bottoms. the claim of some of them is that gold has been marking out a bearish rising wedge. that is not how it looks to us – instead we see a fine parallel channel with a parallel inner uptrend at which the last upleg halted. this can be seen on our 2-year chart and also how, with gold having just arrived at the lower boundary of this uptrend channel in a deeply oversold condition on its medium-term macd indicator, we are at the optimum buy spot right now – which explains the aggressive buying on friday that completed the piercing pattern.

Article 8 - gold stocks (gdx) slide, remain “undervalued”
gold stocks (gdx) slide, remain “undervalued” headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! gold stocks news – gold stocks fell tuesday as the market vectors gold miners etf (gdx) slid $1.04 to $62.66 per share. the sell-off in gold stocks and the gdx came as gold futures tumbled to $1,875 after earlier reaching a new record high of $1,917.90 per ounce. the s&p/tsx global gold index, a leading basket of gold stocks in canada, fell 1.8% in concert with the gdx. today’s weakness in gold stocks follows yesterday’s 3.9% rally in the gdx, which brought the gold stocks etf into positive territory on a year-to-date basis. however, with this morning’s decline, the gdx cut its monthly and year-to-date gains to 10.1% and 1.6%, respectively. this compares rather unfavorably to the yellow metal, which has surged 16.2% in august and 32.1% this year. commenting on the underperformance of gold stocks and the gdx relative to gold bullion, rodman & renshaw analyst wayne atwell attributed the weakness to four factors: “barrick gold (abx), the largest gold company is acquiring a copper company, which demonstrates a lack of confidence in gold, 2) investors are buying gold

gold miner slump pushes tsx down; banks gain wed nov 23, 2016 6:39pm est [ - ] text [ + ] by alastair sharp toronto (reuters) - sharp losses among gold miners weighed heavily on canada's main stock index on wednesday as the precious metal slid to a nine-month low, with the falls offsetting solid gains for heavyweight banks and more subdued rises across most other sectors. a slew of gold mining stocks, including two of the world's largest gold producers, fell between 3 and 8 percent. gold prices slumped as strong u.s. data and the release of minutes from the last u.s. federal reserve policy meeting buoyed the u.s. currency to its highest level since 2003 and further cemented a case for increasing u.s. interest rates next month. barrick gold corp fell 4.5 percent to c$19.72, and goldcorp inc declined 4 percent to c$17.41. kinross gold corp lost 8.2 percent to c$4.26. the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies and accounts for 12 percent of the index's weight, lost 2.6 percent.

Article 2 - drop in orders overseas sets off an investor retreat
cyclical sectors led the stock market on thursday, setting the standard & poor’s 500-stock index up for its first negative week in six, after factory data showed a slowdown in both europe and china. the weak data is hardly a surprise for markets because many analysts have already factored in a recession in europe, and early this month china trimmed its 2012 growth target to an eight-year low of 7.5 percent. but investors were unnerved by the drop in new orders in both regions, which highlighted concerns that an unexpectedly severe downturn could hurt the global recovery. the drop in demand drove calls for the pullback in stocks; the s.& p. 500 has scored 10 weeks of gains out of 11 weeks this year. the benchmark index is still near four-year highs reached on monday. advertisement continue reading the main story “the advance we’ve had so far this year is not sustainable, and the market is taking a little breather,” said terry morris, senior equity manager for national penn investors trust company in reading, pa.

Article 5 - investing; these days, gold earns its shine
historically, war fears have broadened gold's appeal. political instability usually breeds economic difficulties, prompting investors to seek a haven. but even if a war with iraq is avoided, weakness in the american economy will probably buoy gold's value, gold bugs say. ''the slowing economy has eliminated the fear of inflation, but it has raised concerns about deflation,'' said loyd j. stegent, president of stegent equity advisors in houston. ''since lower interest rates, have been slow to the rescue, the fed has had to take additional steps to prevent the deflationary abyss that occurred during the great depression,'' he said. ''so they have turned on the printing presses in an effort to reinflate the economy and have been buying treasuries.'' gold, of course, is always a hedge against inflation, the end result of printing money. to mr. stegent, the federal budget deficit also weakens the already slipping dollar sending more people to precious metals like gold as the haven of choice. he is telling clients to put 10 percent to 25 percent of their assets in gold mutual funds. virginia gerhart, a financial planner who runs her own firm in san rafael, calif., has favored a small allocation -- about 5 percent -- in gold since 1979. but, she says, picking individual stocks is a ''burden.'' investors have, for example, punished barrick gold, the world's third-largest gold producer

Title: gold and silver shares retest of 2010 breakout almost complete
Content: gold and silver shares retest of 2010 breakout almost complete (before it's news) at the start of the year we wrote about what we could expect from the gold stocks and juniors over the first half of the year. all of these markets experienced significant multi-year breakouts in late 2010. this year called for a retest of those breakouts before the next advance would begin. we believed that these markets would spend much of 2011 retesting the breakouts and that markets would later be in position for an unabated advance into 2012 and beyond. we wanted to provide an update on. first we have the nyse gold miners index. this is broader than the hui and gdx but generally follows the same pattern. the market brokeout in september 2010 and successfully retested the breakout in january and two weeks ago. the large cap miners have struggled but are now in an excellent position. essentially there is no resistance after the peaks near 1800. we also want to note that on any historical gold stock index, the 2008 highs are essentially the same as the 1980 highs. thus, the breakout in late 2010, if sustained is a historic breakout. our junior gold index (25 companies equal weighted) has been the strongest. it broke past its 2007 high in late 2009. the market has a larger retest zone than the others. the market recently bottomed at a strong confluence of support. the bottom came at the 62% retracement of the 2010 advance, an area of lateral support as well as our 300-day moving average band. we expect the low to be retested later this summer but it should hold. meanwhile our junior silver index (10 stocks equally weighted) has the clearest breakout/retest pattern. the market broke past 170 in late 2010 before reaching 240 in early 2010. the late january bottom occurred at 175. the recent bottom occurred at 210. these breakouts are from multi-year resistance so retests will generally last longer than a few months. there you have it. gold and silver shares have acted according to a big picture plan we laid out at the start of the year. major multi-year breakouts are always accompanied by a retest that can take months to play out. nine or twelve months from now this retest will be a distant memory and likely a missed opportunity for most to accumulate shares in a bull market that could is on the cusp of a major move higher. if you are looking for more analysis and professional guidance as to how to profit in this bull market, then we invite you to learn about our premium service. good luck! jordan roy-byrne, cmt jordan@thedailygold.com read more at daily gold source:

could a nuclear war in asia effect you? absolutely headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! right now all eyes on north korea, which is totally understandable. the rhetoric being exchanged between our government and theirs has never been so heated, and at this point it wouldn’t be a surprise if war broke out. however, while the media has been parading an endless stream of worrisome stories on this subject, they’ve neglected to keep tabs on another brewing conflict between china and india. for weeks the two countries have been hashing out a war of words over a border dispute in bhutan. the chinese tried to build a road in disputed territory, and the indian army was deployed to block them. since then the chinese have been threatening to annihilate the indian soldiers if they aren’t removed. over the past month, the people’s liberation army (pla) has been on the move. we believe that the pla has made sufficient preparation for military confrontation. it is a war with an obvious result. the government of prime minister narendra modi should be aware of the pla’s overwhelming firepower and logistics. indian border troops are no rival to pla field forces. if a war spreads, the pla is perfectly capable of annihilating all indian troops in the border region. and that isn’t just bluster. china and india have gone to war over border disputes as recently as the 1960s. the only difference now, is that these nations both have nuclear weapons.

Article 5 - analysts: expect attack from chinese military

Article 4 - two indian soldiers killed in attack on army base
posted on november 29, 2016 by editor - political news srinagar (india) (afp) – armed militants attacked a major indian army base near the border with pakistan early tuesday, killing two soldiers, police said. the attack comes at a time of heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours following a deadly assault on an indian army base in september that new delhi blamed on pakistan-based militants. “three to four militants entered the army corps headquarters at nagrota and fired towards the officers’ mess,” a senior police officer told afp, referring to a town in northern india roughly 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the border. “two officers were killed and an exchange of fire is on,” he told afp by phone, speaking on condition of anonymity. defence ministry spokesman manish mehta said the attack was still going on, but did not comment on the casualties. “early morning an encounter took place and terrorists have entered one of our military areas. the situation is under control, as soon as the operation is over we will be able to give details,” he told reporters. “terrorists are armed, they have weapons, and that is why firefight is taking place.” no group has claimed responsibility for the attack on the nagrota base, one of four command centres in the northern state of jammu and kashmir and home to over 1,000 officers. it came after months of dangerous tensions between the rivals in the disputed him

Article 5 - guns fall silent, but tensions high between india, pakistan
new delhi (ap) — an uneasy calm has fallen over the de facto border between the indian and pakistani-controlled portions of kashmir after months of deadly firing and signs that the two countries were engaged in a brinkmanship not seen for decades. though guns have gone silent for the past five days, analysts say the two nuclear-armed neighbors have displayed unprecedented aggression this year without pursuing any real lines of diplomacy. they've amped up the artillery they've used and targeted infrastructure instead of just military outposts. the corpses of soldiers killed in battle have been found mutilated. ""the level of retaliation was definitely more intense than what india has done in the past,"" said defense analyst c. uday bhaskar of the new delhi-based think tank society for policy studies. ""there is a danger of it spiraling out of control,"" bhaskar said. ""if both sides decide that neither side will blink, then the collateral damage will only increase."" that could also mean recalling diplomats, halting the buses ferrying people back and forth across the border, or stopping all trade. in 2015, bilateral trade amounted to just $2.6 billion — far below the $10.9 billion indian government economists say is possible under normal relations. india and pakistan have long been foes, fighting two of their three wars over their rival claims to the himalayan region of kashmir. countless rounds of peace talks have yielded scant results. the two sides reached a cease

Article 6 - where smugglers once roamed, toothpaste hardly squeezes through
for the first time, pakistan sent a large number of troops into the tribal areas, particularly along a 25-mile stretch across from tora bora in the white mountains. while the primary reason was to block exits for mr. bin laden, analysts said the deployment may provide pakistan with the chance to finally assert control over the lawless frontier. ''the government may want to use this particular opportunity to consolidate the administrative control over this area, which has defied governments since the british,'' said dr. rifaat hussain, chairman of defense studies at quaid-i-azam university in islamabad, pakistan. ''i think the government would like to take maximum advantage of the chance.'' the region's independent nature is obvious from a sign at the western edge of hayatabad warning that no foreigners are allowed to proceed. a policeman lounging nearby wagged a finger and said: ''pakistani police cannot protect you there. you are on your own.'' the government itself had to negotiate with tribal leaders before its soldiers could be sent in. there were reports that some leaders were paid large sums for permission, something the government denies. people in this chaotic bazaar straddling the grand trunk road described watching pakistani troop convoys headed west each of the last three nights. some soldiers cradled rocket-propelled grenade launchers and other heavy weapons, they said. authorities said soldiers are patrolling the rugged mountains and arid valleys on foot, on horseback in off-road

new york times magazine profile piece on governor chris christie (before it's news) how chris christie did his homework matt bai new york times magazine published: february 24, 2011 like a stand-up comedian working out-of-the-way clubs, chris christie travels the townships and boroughs of new jersey­, places like hackettstown and raritan and scotch plains, sharpening his riffs about the state’s public employees, whom he largely blames for plunging new jersey into a fiscal death spiral. in one well-worn routine, for instance, the governor reminds his audiences that, until he passed a recent law that changed the system, most teachers in the state didn’t pay a dime for their health care coverage, the cost of which was borne by taxpayers. and so, christie goes on, forced to cut more than $$1 billion in local aid in order to balance the budget, he asked the teachers not only to accept a pay freeze for a year but also to begin contributing 1.5 percent of their salaries toward health care. the dominant teachers’ union in the state responded by spending millions of dollars in television and radio ads to attack him. “the argument you heard most vociferously from the teachers’ union,” christie says, “was that this was the greatest assault on public education in the history of new jersey.” here the fleshy governor lumbers a few steps toward the audience and lowers his voice

6587739.0,fake,fake,0.8,62.99676442146301,True,"The article ""death for homeschooling"" does not match the RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY, as it lacks any connection to the topics mentioned in the summary. The article appears to be unrelated to the discussion of Satan's supposed power and intentions, biblical references, or modern-day discussions about faith and spirituality. The FAKE NEWS SUMMARY provides a plausible explanation for the articles discussed, but there is no evidence that the article ""death for homeschooling"" is part of this discussion.","Summary:

The articles discuss a recurring theme: if Satan is as powerful as believed, then why does he pretend to be Jesus during the time of Jacob's Trouble. This paradox is explored in various contexts, including biblical references and modern-day discussions.

Key points include:

- The idea that Satan would not need to disguise himself as Jesus if he were truly powerful.
- The concept of Jacob's Trouble, a period mentioned in biblical prophecy.
- The notion that Satan's actions contradict his supposed power and intentions.

The articles seem to be exploring the apparent contradiction between Satan's supposed strength and his alleged deception. However, without explicit statements or concrete evidence, the discussion remains speculative and open to interpretation.","A series of articles discusses various topics, including:

* A 16th-century scholar Christian Stern arrives in Prague to study the occult arts but instead encounters a murder mystery. He is invited to court due to his name being associated with Christ.
* Two pro-life activists suggest that hurricanes are a message from God to restore boundaries on gender and sexuality.
* A theologian urges students at Liberty University to trust in the Lord, not government, and follow their calling rather than a job.
* The mayor of Ingles, Florida, bans Satan from the city limits after receiving a vision from God.
* An NBC epic series ""A.D. the Bible Continues"" draws a huge audience for its third episode, which explores the linguistic patterns of the Bible.
* A theologian tells Liberty University students to be in the world but not of it, and to trust in the Lord's plan for their lives.
* NFL quarterback Benjamin Watson shares a Christmas message inspired by Joan Osborne's song ""What If God Was One of Us,"" urging people to remember the reason for Christmas.
* A playwright writes about feeling overwhelmed and helpless, with characters who yell at their troubles rather than seeking therapy.

photo every 16th-century savant and scholar and crackpot aspired to study in prague under great minds like the astronomer johannes kepler and the court mathematician, tycho brahe. as a novice in the occult arts, christian stern, the young narrator of benjamin black’s wolf on a string (holt, $28), is desperate to extend his studies in that “capital of magic.” but no sooner does he arrive in the city, in the winter of 1599, than he comes upon the corpse of a well-dressed woman, savagely murdered and dumped in the snow. her grieving father warns christian to travel on to dresden or some other center of learning. “prague is no place for you,” he’s told. “here everything is tainted and sick.” because of his name, which, in the view of the learned if eccentric holy roman emperor rudolf ii, marks him as a messenger sent by christ, christian is invited to court and is even housed in the same room once used by dr. john dee, a master alchemist “steeped in the mysteries of the kabbalah.” there’s not much magic in this tale and christian never gets a chance to study the occult arts, but he encounters plenty of intrigue, enough to convince this naïve hero that he’s landed at “the center of an intricately devised, immensely subtle and cruelly malicious game.” he’s introduced to turkish coffee (which

Article 2 - benham brothers: hurricanes are god's message for america to restore boundaries on gender, sexuality
(photo: facebook/benham brothers) david (l) and jason (r) benham in a facebook video posted on august 18, 2017. jason and david benham, two pro-life activists and conservative christian brothers from north carolina, have suggested that the hurricanes striking the united states are a message from god to the people to put back up the boundaries on gender and sexuality. the brothers said in a joint facebook video on monday, the 16thanniversary of the september 11, 2001, terror attacks on the u.s., that they would not have believed it back then if someone had told them all the changes that would be taking place in the nation in 2017. the benhams, whose house-flipping hgtv show was canceled in 2014 after critics spoke out against their views on same-sex marriage and abortion, said that america talked a lot about rebuilding back in 2001, but one word that wasn't heard was ""repent."" they suggested that it would not have been believed if ""as a nation you would have told us back then, in 2001, that in 2017 we would be completely redefining what gender means, what marriage means, what sexuality means; that people wouldn't be standing for the anthem; that there would be riots and protests on the streets, and white supremacists with torches in their hands, and antifa bullying and beating people into comas."" the

""when you are filled with god's spirit everything changes. when you are filled with the holy spirit, you are able to do what you were not able to do before. the spirit came down and peter did what? he raised his voice…listen carefully, religion makes us complacent while revival makes us courageous. today's complacency is tomorrow's captivity,"" he warned. preaching from acts 2:14 highlighting the reaction of the apostle peter after the initial descent of the holy spirit on the day of pentecost, rodriguez urged the believers to ""be filled, stand up, and raise your voice."" in acts 2, after the holy spirit had first descended, it said of those who had witnessed it: ""and they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying

Article 4 - florida town finds satan an offense unto it
so mrs. risher, the mayor in this town of 1,400 residents for as long as many people can remember, sent him on down the road. she has made international news by banning satan, by mayoral proclamation, from the inglis city limits. she has drawn praise and condemnation and has become the butt of jokes. ''it doesn't bother me,'' she said, ''either way.'' to some people, it is a most heinous violation of the separation of church and state. to others, there was too much separation there already, and it took mrs. risher, a 61-year-old from florida's gulf coast, to pinch church and state together again. mrs. risher, who is known to drive a wrecker for her husband's towing business when she is not handling city business, did not plan on any of that. ''i did what was best for my town and my people,'' mrs. risher said. she did it, she said, because on a late night more than four months ago, god told her to. inglis, about 75 miles north of tampa, was in the grip of what could only be surmised by religious leaders here as satan. to an outsider, cruising down this open stretch of u.s. 19, it would not have looked that way. it would have looked as it always does, slow, a little sleepy, a place where tall, slim palms

Article 6 - theologian to liberty univ. students: christians don't have jobs, they have ministry
theologian robert smith jr. urged students at liberty university last week to be in the world but not of the world, charging them with following a calling, not a job. smith, who is professor of divinity at beeson divinity school, spoke during last friday's convocation –a gathering for liberty university students every monday, wednesday and friday at the vines center –about trusting in the lord, not government. he focused his speech on trusting the plan of god and using it as a vision, citing from jeremiah 29:10-11. smith told the students that god should be their vision because god knows the plans that he has for them. ""god is always going before us to plan our lives,"" smith said. ""he is our vision. we don't need another one."" smith went on to say, ""i don't know where you are going when you leave here, but god orchestrates your life providentially so that there's nothing done by accident, by incident, by coincidence. everything is done by providence. he is your vision. he will bring you out."" in a very firm tone, the professor told students, ""stop complaining. stop whining. stop saying i'd be a better husband if i had a better wife. i'd be a better student if i had a better teacher. i'd be a better believer if i had a better pastor."" in a charge to students, smith told them not to look for jobs.

Article 8 - the sound of fury
unschooled as a writer, he has never been associated with any of the prominent theaters that yearn to take young playwrights under their wings (though he has now been commissioned by the manhattan theater club and the south coast repertory in costa mesa, calif.). instead, he has become the voice of the scruffy, scrappy labyrinth theater company, an ensemble that includes philip seymour hoffman, john patrick shanley, daphne rubin-vega and john ortiz, who goaded him into writing and then coalesced around the work he produced. as a playwright, he seems to have come out of nowhere, a baby born full grown. in fact, he came from new york, the son of an irish catholic mother and an egyptian father, and in his work, he is making a bid to become a kind of city laureate. his plays teem with ethnic variety, but the demographic they most consistently represent, and to which he evidently belongs, is of a different sort: that of the perpetually overwhelmed, those who feel they are helpless against the forces of their lives, drowning in their own inconsequentiality. tormented as they are, his characters don't know what to do about it but yell. they don't have the discretionary income or the navel-gazing impulse to take their troubles into therapy. they are alert for a scam and a quick buck, the kind of new yorkers

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Summary:

The articles discuss a recurring theme: if Satan is as powerful as believed, then why does he pretend to be Jesus during the time of Jacob's Trouble. This paradox is explored in various contexts, including biblical references and modern-day discussions.

Key points include:

- The idea that Satan would not need to disguise himself as Jesus if he were truly powerful.
- The concept of Jacob's Trouble, a period mentioned in biblical prophecy.
- The notion that Satan's actions contradict his supposed power and intentions.

The articles seem to be exploring the apparent contradiction between Satan's supposed strength and his alleged deception. However, without explicit statements or concrete evidence, the discussion remains speculative and open to interpretation.

playing tennis offers many physical benefits headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! while experts agree that engaging in vigorous physical activity can aid in overall health, the differences between types of sports can be significant. whether you engage in cycling, running, inline skating, downhill skiing, golf or other sports on a long-term basis, the benefits to your body are measurable. according to some experts, tennis offers the greatest all-around benefit to the body as people age. cardiovascular benefits tennis offers significant cardiovascular benefits by lowering blood pressure, increasing lung function, reducing stress and burning excess calories. these factors play a large role in the development of cardiovascular disease. those people who learn to play tennis early in life tend to continue playing well into middle age. studies show that these individuals have a much lower incidence of cardiovascular disease. those interested in seeing the benefits of tennis in action should get tickets to the us open tennis 2013 event to see exactly how athletic tennis can be. muscle strength tennis also provides a workout for the muscles of the legs, arms, back, shoulders and neck. this comprehensive muscle workout creates strong support for the joints and spinal column, which helps to avoid problems from osteoarthritis and disc disease. the muscles also become more flexible which can be most helpful as people age when most injuries are likely to occur. bone health in addition to strengthening the muscles that support the bones of the body, the resulting circulation and impact helps to increases the bone density in those who play tennis

speaking to power … (before it's news) speaking to power … having gotten back into my boxing groove starting at the end of december when my surgeon gave me the all clear to whale away, my body has begun to find its power again. it’s not all the time or even some of the time, but an occasional thing when i’ll come upon something that i can lift with ease even though i know it’s really heavy, or when i’m about to finish up my light run from my house to the gym and realize that i could keep going for quite a ways. that sense of comfort with my body or the sense that it has power is not something i’ve had very often in my life. growing up in nyc in the 1960s meant very little by way of sports–as in punch ball, stoop ball and king, a kind of hand ball where each person had one concrete square in the sidewalk as their “box.” at summer camp i swam and otherwise did what i could *not* to have to play softball in the heat of the afternoon in a field swarming with no-see-ums. as for basketball, i was hopeless when it came to anything but drippling the ball. the only running i ever did in those days were “chase” games and aside from tap dancing lessons at the age of 12 (for three months at charlie lowe’s school where i learned to use my “personality”), i didn’t

[...] now, thanks to u.s. olympic medalist leo manzano, and what i consider to be the misguided and ill-mannered way he chose to celebrate his silver medal in the 1500-meters final, i get the chance to think through the subject of flag-waving once again. after manzano finished his race and secured his medal, he did what athletes typically do at the olympics. he held up his country’s flag — the stars and stripes. the 27-year-old was born in mexico, but the united states is his country now. his father migrated here illegally from the city of dolores hidalgo. manzano was brought here when he was 4. like most immigrants, they came in search of greater opportunity. and they found it — for themselves, and their children. [...] you can’t help but be proud of manzano and the country that allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his potential. so why did manzano carry two flags with him on his victory lap? as the world looked on, he held up both the u.s. flag and the mexican flag. not a good look. and not a good idea. manzano posted messages on twitter throughout the competition — in spanish

Article 1 - olympian narratives
race walking provided the most riveting olympic moment for television viewers in mexico. danes were mesmerized by badminton, south koreans by their men's field hockey team. chinese and swedish fans watched an epic battle between two longtime rivals for table-tennis gold. in the netherlands, these olympics were mostly about swimming. in cameroon, they were about soccer. the olympic games, it is easy to forget, are no monolith. because it is human nature to cheer our own, the olympics are experienced, and ultimately remembered, in different ways in different places. but the narratives all share a common theme, one of athletic prowess and determination overcoming the surrounding clutter -- the politics of the olympic bureaucracy, the cynicism, the specter of performance-enhancing drugs, the complaints about saccharine broadcasting and all the rest. to be sure, there are some global olympic memories too, moments awe-inspiring enough to transcend parochialism and pull in all the separate narratives: cathy freeman, the australian and aboriginal sprinter, winning gold in the 400-meter race and carrying both her national and ethnic flag on her victory lap; michael johnson becoming the first man to win the 400-meter sprint in consecutive olympics; china's fu mingxia becoming only the third diver to win four olympic gold medals. then there was the heartbreak of the russian gymnast sv

Article 2 - next stop, salt lake city
now that the super bowl is over, the eclectic assortment of snow and ice-based sporting events known as the winter olympics will soon be in high gear in salt lake city and the wasatch range that towers over that western metropolis. it will probably seem to many viewers -- especially those who remember when the summer and winter games were played back to back once every four years -- as though the sydney olympics just ended. actually, a lot has changed since sydney. the salt lake city games were planned under juan antonio samaranch, the longtime president of the international olympic committee, but they will be played under his successor, jacques rogge, who brings a less regal, more human demeanor to the job. one of the inevitable subtexts of these games will be the corruption that afflicted the selection process and led to the indictment of two members of the salt lake organizing committee. it also led to a change in i.o.c. procedures and the replacement of 10 i.o.c. members. the charges against the two salt lake city officials have been dismissed, but the corruption on the i.o.c. was real, and it was pandered to in salt lake city. another subtext will, of course, be the question of security. salt lake city has faced the extraordinary task of reinventing security procedures in the few months since sept. 11, bringing them up to a standard that will protect and reassure everyone, athletes and spectators alike

Article 3 - britain’s huge investment in summer olympic sports pays off
u.k. sport also gives leading athletes support worth about $47,000 to about $79,000, which is spent on coaching and training. each medal that britain won in rio has cost, on average, more than $6.5 million. britain not only has spent huge amounts on achieving olympic success but also has been meticulous in how the funding is used. “what makes the difference is the amount of money, but also the way in which it is managed, targeted and ruthlessly audited and accounted for,” said borja garcía, a senior lecturer in sport management and policy at loughborough university in england. photo u.k. sport uses what it has called a no-compromise approach, prioritizing sports in which britain has good prospects of winning medals. and in sports like cycling and rowing, success has become self-perpetuating: each successful games results in a further uptick in funding, leaving britain in a position to win more medals at the next olympics. the investment not only targets sports that offer the best medal prospects but also those sports that offer the most medals, garcía said. sports that do not offer good prospects have had their funding cut or, in the case of basketball and volleyball for this year’s games, removed altogether. the funding has helped britain be at the cutting edge of developments in sports science and psychology, technology, coaching and talent identification. the best example of this is in cycling

Article 4 - no accounting for taste
to the sports editor: outside of the soap operas that seem to swirl around olympic skating -- paging tonya harding -- there have been endless charges of questionable practices of bloc judging. at its best, the judging can recognize that athleticism and artistry can be historically unmatched as in jayne torvill and christopher dean's ''bolero,'' which broke all the ice dancing rules of the time but garnered all 6.0's for artistic impression and changed the sport. on the other end, would nancy kerrigan have won a medal if she hadn't been bashed in the knee with a crowbar? the fact is that the judging is ultimately subjective, so this pairs panel ultimately endorsed the 38-year reign of the russians in this event. the positive side of this is the whole discussion of how an athletic event with artistic requirements is to be judged. my guess is that it will always be controversial because there is no accounting for taste. and with the olympics, politics either. lewis whittington philadelphia

Article 5 - review: in ‘swim team,’ autism is no barrier to competition
photo autistic children typically don’t have an easy time learning to swim. “every kid in the pool is different,” notes michael mcquay, the coach of a youth team in perth amboy, n.j. some have sensory issues with touch and sound. that’s all the more reason to have the jersey hammerheads, the special olympics swimming team mr. mcquay founded with his wife, maria, inspired by mikey, their son. mikey, one of the hammerheads’ stars, is among the three principal subjects of “swim team,” a documentary by lara stolman. (an excerpt from the movie appeared on the new york times’s website in 2015.) the others are robbie, who says he aspires to be faster than michael phelps, and kelvin, who has tourette’s syndrome in addition to autism. made over the course of two years, the documentary follows the challenges they face, both personally and as a group.

nobody blew anything up. rain did not reduce olympic stadium to a soggy mess filled with waterlogged athletes and wretched spectators. london's transportation system did not break down or seize up or become the world's laughingstock.to the shock and then relief of a nation used to large events going awry, the olympics instead went smoothly. people got to where they were meant to be. the food did not run out. nobody attacked wenlock the mascot. and everyone, from the most important official to the person whose job it was to confiscate our water and frisk for weapons, remained genuinely buoyant. on saturday at the olympic park, hundreds of mellow people stretched out on the banks of the newly unpolluted river lea, watching a giant screen that showed women racewalking through central london.

Title: why we love the olympics
Content: why we love the olympics (before it's news) while i was watching the united states battle croatia in the quarterfinals of the men’s water polo tournament, a thought came into my mind, “why are people around the world so fond of the olympics?” of course we enjoy watching the best in the world compete in sports that we see everyday on television, like tennis and basketball; but why do we drool and wait in anticipation over the results of the judo events or the archery competitions? why over a two and a half week period am i going on my phone every hour to see who won the most recent handball match? i began to think, “would i ever dare skip out on going outside and enjoying the summer just to watch water polo if this weren’t the olympics?” nothing against water polo, and how much respect i have for the men and women who play the grueling sport, but the answer to that question is a definitive no! although it may seem that crazy fans like myself are the only ones that have this over the top obsession with the olympics, the athletes who compete also feel an unparalleled passion for the games. in tennis, andy murray and victoria azarenka competed in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, which is something that the top players never do, even at majors. rafael nadal said missing out on the olympics was one of the saddest moments of his career. lebron james, who finished his nba season in late june, refused to take a summer break after his long playoff run because he wanted to play for team usa. tons of athletes have shown their love of the games by getting the olympic rings tattooed on their body such as swimmers michael phelps, ryan lochte, and matthew grevers. what is it that makes the olympics so different, so irresistible? first, people love the olympics because they don’t occur every year. in sports, and in life, the less frequently something happens, the more interested people are when something does happen. for example, people are enamored by perfect games and no-hitters because they don’t occur everyday; instead, they are truly rare feats. while an mlb player may have over 20 shots at a title, olympians usually only have two or three chances at a gold medal. people are captivated by the aspect that usain bolt has one shot at the 100 meters, and if he comes up short, he will have to wait 4 years to get back on the globe’s biggest stage. unlike a player in the nfl or nba, bolt can’t make a mistake and come back the next game, or the next season in hopes of a title. olympians work tirelessly to get on top of the olympic podium, but if they don’t, it’s a long four year journey to

Overall, I believe that the article is a reliable news source because it presents a nuanced and balanced view of the healthcare system's challenges and proposes practical solutions for addressing them.","Medicare is facing insolvency, with estimates suggesting it will happen regardless of the president's election. The program has been criticized for its high costs and inefficiencies, leading to proposals for reform. One such proposal involves vouchers that can be applied to private insurance, while others suggest reducing payments to doctors and hospitals.

The healthcare system in the US is facing significant challenges, with many Americans struggling to afford medical care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been criticized for its high deductibles and co-pays, leading to a situation where individuals are technically insured but unable to access necessary care.

Reform efforts have focused on reducing costs and increasing competition, with proposals including tax credits and deductions to encourage individuals to purchase health insurance. However, these efforts have been met with resistance from some lawmakers, who argue that the ACA is too expensive and inefficient.

The US government is facing significant financial challenges, with a national debt of over $42,000 per person. This has led to concerns about the country's long-term fiscal sustainability and the potential for bankruptcy.

Overall, the healthcare system in the US is facing significant challenges, including high costs, inefficiencies, and access issues. Reform efforts are underway, but progress has been slow due to partisan divisions and disagreements over policy details.","Healthcare system challenges and costs are significant concerns. Medicare expansion to cover everyone is proposed, but the underlying economic model needs to be successfully challenged. Rising healthcare costs have led to a more businesslike approach, with most policymakers believing that market discipline will cure the ills of the system.

The individual and small-group insurance markets have seen premium increases exceeding 10% annually, prompting public disclosure of planned rate increases and justifications. The federal government is setting a threshold for each state, reflecting trends in insurance and medical costs.

Specialty hospitals are booming due to generous Medicare payments, which create excess demand rather than improving clinical quality. This has led to concerns about the incentives being misaligned.

Cost savings are imperative, but limiting access to some treatments is a challenge. The tax subsidy for health insurance purchase encourages people to buy more expensive plans, and the drug- and device-approval process needs to take cost savings into account.

A national survey found that 20% of the population delayed or did without needed medical care in 2009, with soaring medical costs being the main reason. Insured patients are also choosing to go without care due to high deductibles and co-payments.

Medicare and Medicaid can outmatch private plans on cost for certain services, but doctors tend to treat all patients similarly regardless of who is paying the bill. The new reimbursement formula has left millions of insured families more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills.

paul krugman: zombies against medicare (before it's news) despite what you might hear from conservatives, medicare is “eminently sustainable”: zombies against medicare, by paul krugman, commentary, ny times: medicare turns 50 this week, and it has been a very good half-century. before the program went into effect, ronald reagan warned that it would destroy american freedom; it didn’t, as far as anyone can tell. what it did do was provide a huge improvement in financial security for seniors and their families, and in many cases it has literally been a lifesaver as well. but the right has never abandoned its dream of killing the program. so it’s really no surprise that jeb bush recently declared that while he wants to let those already on medicare keep their benefits, “we need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others.” … the … reason conservatives want to do away with medicare has always been political: it’s the very idea of the government providing a universal safety net that they hate, and they hate it even more when such programs are successful. but … they usually shy away from making their real case… what medicare’s would-be killers usually argue, instead, is that the program as we know it is unaffordable — that we must destroy the system in order to save it… and the new system they usually advocate is … vouchers that can be applied to the purchase of private insurance.

what should be done if we could fix things in the us? by dr. laurie roth february 4, 2011 newswithviews.com let’s cut to the bottom line and visualize together getting stuff done. the first thing i would do: kill the obamacare bill and start over with a plan that isn’t socialist, doesn’t tax the people, doesn’t ration care, doesn’t limit competition and doesn’t pay for abortions. we must repeal the entire health care bill as it now stands. it has already been voted down as unconstitutional by two federal judges. there will be more as the 26 law suits by tons of states are addressed. then we must explore real health care change and answers, such as portability, torte reform, increasing affordability by increasing competition and common sense. we should explore real incentives for clinics and hospitals to offer reduced rates for seniors and the needy and to help friends and relatives pay health care bills. we can fix our health care needs as a country without going socialist or bankrupting us if we have the right vision and will. next we need to tackle real tax reform the last thing americans need are more taxes. a large and swift way to heal up our economy, create tons of jobs and get the value of our money working in the right direction, is to not only drastically cut taxes but to change the whole tax system. i have come to the conclusion that the most fair, innovative, simple way is the automated payment transaction

Article 3 - kaine’s healthcare law gives 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide the healthcare decisions for virginians
kaine’s healthcare law gives 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide the healthcare decisions for virginians (before it's news) with two-year anniversary approaching, the consequences of tim kaine’s healthcare law when former democrat national committee (dnc) chairman tim kaine helped make president barack obama’s intrusive healthcare bill the law of the land, we knew it would force every virginian to purchase health insurance, but now we are learning that it will give 15 unelected bureaucrats the power to decide which healthcare decisions are best for virginians. in fact, the american hospital association, along with over 70 medical groups warned the democrat leadership – which included nancy pelosi, harry reid and chairman kaine – that the independent payment advisory board (ipab) could limit seniors’ access to medicare and even the infrastructure for the entire healthcare system. additionally, it’s been reported that the ipab’s true end game is to arbitrarily control the price of healthcare and decide what type of medical treatments patients in virginia can receive. as the wall street journal reports: public opposition to the affordable care act has grown in surprising and unpredictable ways since the entitlement passed two years ago, but few would have predicted then that so many democrats would repudiate so many of president obama’s core promises. yet that is happening now, as congress targets the 15-member central committee that is supposed to control health costs. … this turn is remarkable because the ipab really does

Article 4 - the truth about medicare
the truth about medicare (before it's news) medicare is heading toward insolvency and that will happen no matter who is elected president if action is not taken to save the program and soon. socialist president obama will propose tax increases on all concerned, particularly the “rich”, that he defines as families and businesses earning more than $$250,000 a year, to save medicare because tax increases are always the solution for socialists, rather than tough decisions. romney/ryan will propose long term solutions to save medicare for future generations. obama cut more than $$700 billion out of medicare to help pay for obamacare to provide medical insurance for obama’s peep’s; those on the dole, those that pay no income taxes at all and eventually for illegal aliens. cutting that money from medicare will result in lower payments to doctors and hospitals, which will result in fewer doctors willing to take medicare. it is already happening, which is the reason congress must step in every year to enact the “doc fix” to restore higher payments. however, if these cuts really do happen, this will lead to rationing of medical care for senior citizens and the infamous death panels in obamacare. in addition, cutting that $$700 billion from medicare will result in eliminating the medicare advantage hmo program, which will negatively impact 22 million, mostly lower income senior citizens, that will lose this great program. once gone, these seniors will experience much higher cost

Article 5 - america’s great health care takeaway
the health care crisis in the united states is getting worse with no visible end. the popular anger over unattainable or unaffordable health care has been diverted away from corporations by crafty politicians, always seeking to exploit a social disaster for their benefactors. instead of making health care more affordable for the average person, politicians have successfully switched the messaging. now, the purpose behind “reform” is to make health care less costly for governments and employers, at the expense of patients and workers. this was the essence behind obama’s health care reform. and although republicans exploited the “individual mandate” in obamacare to gain populist credentials, they wholeheartedly agree with the deeper philosophy of the plan, which aspires to control health care costs — for corporations and governments — by providing less health care services to those who need it. this agreement to “ration” health care aligns the two parties over the coming cuts to medicare in obama’s bi-partisan “super congress,” while also binding the two parties’ approach to health care on a state and business level. most workers now understand that there is a difference between apparently having health care and actually having health care: if you are technically “insured” but cannot afford doctor visits due to high deductibles and co-pays, you really aren’t insured. this fact, applied to medicare, has startling consequences. the new england journal of medicine found that, “for every 100 people enrolled in plans that

(before it's news) here i sit, in west virginia, staring down at january 1, 2014. that’s when my health insurance policy expires and i have a decision to make — renew or not renew? right now, i’m paying about $$7,000 a year in premiums for a monster deductible and yearly out of pocket of about $$15,000 for myself and my family. my health insurance company informed me yesterday that my premium will doubled to $$14,000 on january 1. i’ve been trying to get onto the obamacare web site now for ten days to search for an alternative. no luck. i made it through four pages yesterday — then got a message saying i’d have to wait because there was too much traffic. when i clicked the continue button, it wiped out the information i had typed into the first three pages. but even if i do get onto the exchanges, it’s probably not going to matter. i read in a newspaper that highmark is the only health insurance company on the exchange in west virginia. yesterday, i called highmark and spent an hour on the phone with a nice young man — but the results were not good. the skimpiest plan is going to cost me more than i’m paying now for a higher deductible and out of pocket result. thank you obamacare. my insurance agent told me yesterday i

Article 1 - fixing holes in the health care net
to the editor: paul krugman suggests that if medicare were extended to cover everyone, it ''would save money, reduce financial anxiety and save thousands of american lives every year.'' he asks, ''why don't we just do it?'' we won't do it until the underlying economic model is successfully challenged. despite rising costs as health care has been pushed to become more businesslike, most policy makers appear to believe that more market discipline will cure the ills of the health care system. the system is becoming more fractured and expensive, but the prevailing ideology is still for more economic incentives, less coordination, more variation and less security. mr. krugman is right that we could do it better and more cheaply with a single-payer system, but that requires believing that not every good is a result of free-market economics and not every social ill is caused by government. that's still an uphill battle today. peter mcginn binghamton, n.y., may 1, 2006 the writer is president and chief executive of united health services, a not-for-profit health system.

Article 2 - health insurers to be required to justify rate increases over 10 percent
the law did not define unreasonable — a gap the administration is now trying to fill. under the rule issued tuesday, insurers seeking increases of 10 percent or more in the individual or small-group market next year must publicly disclose the planned increases and the justifications for them. in recent years, individual and small-group premiums have been rising more than 10 percent a year, on average, and many increases far exceed national measures of medical cost inflation, federal officials said. the 10 percent threshold may change in later years. starting in 2012, the federal government will set a threshold for each state, reflecting trends in its insurance and medical costs. consumer advocates welcomed the rules as a way to hold insurers accountable for skyrocketing premiums. in the last year, they noted, state officials in california and connecticut, among other states, have denied big rate increases sought by some insurers. photo it was not immediately clear whether the rule would help insurers hold down costs. karen m. ignagni, president of america’s health insurance plans, a trade group, said that in their zeal to review premiums, “the administration and congress have largely ignored factors driving up the cost of coverage.” these factors, ms. ignagni said, include the power of doctors and hospitals to negotiate higher reimbursement rates, new benefit mandates and the tendency of younger, healthier people to drop coverage, leaving sicker people in the insurance pool. under the proposed regulation, the federal government will assess each state’s procedures

Article 3 - generous medicare payments spur specialty hospital boom
amid the building boom here in indianapolis, some hospitals are laying off employees or scaling back programs, like psychiatric care, that are less generously reimbursed. preventive care and case management, health experts add, get short shrift. ''the incentives are terribly misaligned,'' said samuel r. nussbaum, a doctor and former hospital executive who is now the chief medical officer of anthem, a large health insurer here. creating excess demand a study of indianapolis health care last year concluded that the construction of so many new heart hospitals could create excess demand for treatment rather than produce better cardiac care. ''improving clinical quality did not appear to be a driving force for new facilities or services,'' said the report, by the center for studying health system change, a nonprofit research group. ''given these market conditions, provider competition could, alternatively, result in higher use rates and costs.'' in washington, lawmakers rushing to complete a compromise bill that would establish a medicare prescription drug benefit are now turning their attention to the growth of specialty hospitals. the senate version of the medicare bill would make it harder for doctors to invest in and refer patients to such hospitals, and full-service hospitals are lobbying hard for the provision. hospitals will typically not disclose how much they profit from a particular procedure, like a coronary bypass or angioplasty. and medicare -- with little information about the cost of treatment -- cannot say, either. but one full-service medical center that is leading the lobbying campaign against specialty

Article 4 - a cost-savings imperative
dana p. goldman, a professor of medicine and public policy at the university of southern california, posted at the economix blog: why can't congress write a heath care bill that saves money? the answer lies in an unwillingness to come to grips with the need to limit access to some treatments. we continue to develop expensive technologies -- which is good, not bad. but then we apply them to broader swaths of the population without any evidence they will work. in an ideal world, we would give medicare and other government payers the authority to explicitly take cost-effectiveness into account when making coverage decisions. unfortunately, both major political parties are adamant that medicare should continue to cover everything. still, there are worthwhile steps we can take. most importantly, we should stop providing a tax subsidy for the purchase of health insurance. doing so encourages people to buy the most generous plans, which tend to cover all services regardless of need or cost-effectiveness. second, we could tilt the drug- and device-approval process to take into account cost savings. third, we need to let managed care do its job. people should be able to choose from among both expensive and inexpensive plans containing a variety of cost controls. fourth, we need legal reform, including moving malpractice into specialty courts where experts decide the standard of care. without such reforms, health insurance will become so expensive that americans may end up being forced to accept ''death panels,'' just as they have in virtually every other

Article 5 - maybe i’ll get better on my own
while politicians have been debating endlessly over the best ways to reform the american health care system, the plight of american patients has rapidly worsened. a new national survey found that an alarming 20 percent of the population, some 59 million people in all, either delayed or did without needed medical care last year, a huge increase from the 36 million people who delayed or did not seek care in 2003. as expected, people who have no health insurance — there are some 47 million of them — were most likely to make that difficult choice. but insured people also chose to go without care in ever-larger numbers. according to the survey, the main reason is soaring medical costs, which have outstripped the modest growth in wages in recent years. high costs are deterring not only the uninsured from seeking care, but also many insured people who are struggling with higher deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses as their employers or health plans shift more of the cost burden to them. many patients with insurance said they went without care because their health plans would not pay for the treatment or their doctors or hospitals would not accept their insurance. both insured and uninsured patients said they skipped treatments because they had trouble getting timely appointments, were unable to get through on the telephone, or could not make it to a doctor’s office or clinic when it was open. no doubt a weakening economy, high fuel prices, the home foreclosure crisis and general economic anxiety also played a role. advertisement

Article 6 - why medicare and medicaid can outmatch private plans on cost
the researchers found that four of the seven services they examined were provided at similar rates by medicare and commercial market plans: cervical cancer screening over age 65; prescription opioid use for migraines; cardiac testing in asymptomatic patients; and frequent bone density scans. medicare was less likely to pay for unnecessary imaging for back pain, but more likely to pay for vitamin d screening. this finding might seem counterintuitive. commercial market plans pay higher rates and confer higher profit margins, meaning there is more financial incentive for physicians to provide privately insured patients more of all types of care, whether low or high value. photo but other results from the study suggest a more likely explanation: doctors tend to treat all their patients similarly, regardless of who is paying the bill. “what kind of insurance you have does affect your access to health care,” said carrie colla, associate professor of the dartmouth institute for health policy & clinical practice and the lead author of the study. “but once you’re in front of the doctor, by and large you’re treated the same way as any other patient.” one apparent exception found in the study involved the seventh service it examined: cardiac testing before low-risk, noncardiac surgery. this service was provided to 46 percent of medicare beneficiaries and 26 percent of privately insured patients. the large difference could reflect the fact that cardiac problems are more prevalent among older people. so a doctor with equal concern for all her patients might test medicare patients at a higher

(applause.) thank you, lori. lori's story is the same kind of story that i've read in letters, that i've heard in town hall meetings just like this one for the past five years. in fact, some of you were in that town hall -- those town hall meetings, as i was traveling all throughout new hampshire. it's the story of hardworking americans who are held hostage by health insurance companies that deny them coverage, or drop their coverage, or charge fees that they can't afford for care that they desperately need. i believe it is wrong. it is bankrupting families and businesses, and that's why we are going to pass health insurance reform in 2009. (applause.) now, this is obviously a tough time for families here in new hampshire and all across america. six months ago, we were in the middle of the worst recession of our lifetimes. i want you to remember what things were like in january and february. we were losing about 700,000 jobs per month. and economists of all stripes feared a second-coming of the great depression. that was only six months ago. that's why we acted as fast as we could to pass a recovery act that would stop the freefall. and i want to make sure everybody understands what we did

Article 8 - insurers alter cost formula, and patients pay more
insurance companies defend the shift toward medicare-based rates under the settlement, which allowed any clear, objective method of calculating reimbursement. they say that premiums would be even costlier if reimbursements were more generous, and that exorbitant doctors’ fees are largely to blame. but few dispute that as the nation debates an overhaul aimed at insuring everybody, the new realpolitik of reimbursement is leaving millions of insured families more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills, even though they are paying higher premiums, co-payments and deductibles. “they’re not getting what they think they’re paying for,” said benjamin m. lawsky, the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services, whose investigators recently found that under the switch, 4.7 million new york state residents — 76 percent of those with out-of-network coverage — are facing reimbursement reductions of 50 percent or more. the switch “certainly creates the appearance that insurers are trying to end-run the settlement and keep out-of-network payments low,” mr. lawsky said. mr. lawsky, who worked for mr. cuomo when he was attorney general, is seeking legislation in new york state to require that minimum reimbursements be linked to the new database, known as fair health. in the 2009 settlement, the insurers did not admit wrongdoing. but they paid to set up fair health as a replacement for ingenix, a database owned by the insurance giant united healthcare. mr. cuomo said ingenix

Title: in medicine, the power of no
Content: so figuring out how we can say no may be the single toughest and most important task facing the people who will be in charge of carrying out reform. “being able to say no,” dr. alan garber of stanford says, “is the heart of the issue.” it’s easy to come up with arguments for why we need to do so. above all, we don’t have a choice. giving hospitals and drug makers a blank check will bankrupt medicare. slowing the cost growth, on the other hand, will free up resources for other uses, like education. lower costs will also lift workers’ take-home pay. but i suspect that these arguments won’t be persuasive. they have the faint ring of an insurer’s rationale for denying a claim. compared with an anecdote about a cancer patient looking for hope, the economic arguments are soulless. the better bet for the new reformers — starting with donald berwick, the physician who will run medicare — is to channel american culture, not fight it. we want the best possible care, no matter what. yet we often do not get it because the current system tends to deliver more care even when it means worse care. it’s not just ct scans. caesarean births have become more common, with little benefit to babies and significant burden to mothers. men who would never have died from prostate cancer have been treated for it and left incontinent or impotent. cardiac stenting and bypasses, with all their side effects, have become popular partly because people believe they reduce heart attacks. for many patients, the evidence suggests, that’s not true. advocates for less intensive medicine have been too timid about all this. they often come across as bean counters, while the try-anything crowd occupies the moral high ground. the reality, though, is that unnecessary care causes a lot of pain and even death. dr. berwick, who made his reputation campaigning against medical errors, is a promising (if much belated) selection for precisely this reason. can we solve the entire problem of rising health costs by getting rid of needless care? probably not. but the money involved is not trivial, and it’s the obvious place to start. advertisement continue reading the main story • learning to say no more often will be a three-step process, and if the new agencies created by the health act are run well, they can help with all three. newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. invalid email address. please re-enter. you must select a newsletter to subscribe to. sign up you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times's products and services. thank you for subscribing. an error has occurred. please try again later. view all new york times newsletters. the first is learning more about when treatments work and when they don’t. “all too often,” the institute of medicine reports, the data is “incomplete or unavailable

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
Healthcare system challenges and costs are significant concerns. Medicare expansion to cover everyone is proposed, but the underlying economic model needs to be successfully challenged. Rising healthcare costs have led to a more businesslike approach, with most policymakers believing that market discipline will cure the ills of the system.

The individual and small-group insurance markets have seen premium increases exceeding 10% annually, prompting public disclosure of planned rate increases and justifications. The federal government is setting a threshold for each state, reflecting trends in insurance and medical costs.

Specialty hospitals are booming due to generous Medicare payments, which create excess demand rather than improving clinical quality. This has led to concerns about the incentives being misaligned.

Cost savings are imperative, but limiting access to some treatments is a challenge. The tax subsidy for health insurance purchase encourages people to buy more expensive plans, and the drug- and device-approval process needs to take cost savings into account.

A national survey found that 20% of the population delayed or did without needed medical care in 2009, with soaring medical costs being the main reason. Insured patients are also choosing to go without care due to high deductibles and co-payments.

Medicare and Medicaid can outmatch private plans on cost for certain services, but doctors tend to treat all patients similarly regardless of who is paying the bill. The new reimbursement formula has left millions of insured families more vulnerable to catastrophic medical bills.

The healthcare system faces significant challenges, with rising costs, limited access to care,

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Medicare is facing insolvency, with estimates suggesting it will happen regardless of the president's election. The program has been criticized for its high costs and inefficiencies, leading to proposals for reform. One such proposal involves vouchers that can be applied to private insurance, while others suggest reducing payments to doctors and hospitals.

The healthcare system in the US is facing significant challenges, with many Americans struggling to afford medical care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been criticized for its high deductibles and co-pays, leading to a situation where individuals are technically insured but unable to access necessary care.

Reform efforts have focused on reducing costs and increasing competition, with proposals including tax credits and deductions to encourage individuals to purchase health insurance. However, these efforts have been met with resistance from some lawmakers, who argue that the ACA is too expensive and inefficient.

The US government is facing significant financial challenges, with a national debt of over $42,000 per person. This has led to concerns about the country's long-term fiscal sustainability and the potential for bankruptcy.

Overall, the healthcare system in the US is facing significant challenges, including high costs, inefficiencies, and access issues. Reform efforts are underway, but progress has been slow due to partisan divisions and disagreements over policy details.

Article 1 - let’s grow up, liberals
for revolutionaries, mr. sanders and his supporters sure seemed to expect a lot of help from the establishment. these critiques, unsurprisingly, inspired all sorts of conspiracy theories and wild accusations. i was told by two celebrities that their inability to register as democrats and vote for mr. sanders on the day of new york’s primary showed them “the dark underside of american politics.” mrs. clinton has “gamed the nominating process,” and her election will leave “a national majority of citizens in open rebellion,” wrote a retired professor on alice walker’s official website. an online, “instant documentary” charged the democratic party — and by extension, mrs. clinton — with outright fraud at the polls in california. once mr. sanders’s defeat became inescapable, some of his most die-hard believers began to argue that a trump presidency might even be preferable to having mrs. clinton in the white house. “in a way she is more dangerous,” susan sarandon insisted in june, warning that under a president clinton, “we’ll be in iran in two seconds.” but other sanders diehards are quite prepared to “bring the jubilee” and accept a transformative, trump victory. “i’d rather see the empire burn under to the ground under trump, opening up at least the possibility of radical change, than cruise on autopilot under clinton,” the journalist christopher ketcham wrote in the daily beast

correction appended choices, choices. the four seasons in georgetown or the four seasons in midtown? a town full of political leaks or a town full of mysterious odors? easy access to hundreds of gabby democratic strategists or easy access to the one gabby democrat who matters most (one's husband, perhaps)? among the signs that the clinton presidential kabuki is ending -- that senator hillary rodham clinton will, in fact, announce her campaign for the white house soon -- is a decision, democrats close to her say, that she plans to base her campaign headquarters in or around washington instead of in white plains or new york, which had been under consideration. running from a base in washington would make the most practical and financial sense, clinton advisers say, and they note that she would have satellite offices in new york and elsewhere. still, a few advisers and supporters are concerned about the decision, saying it could reinforce her image as a washington insider (if it is possible for that to be any more of an issue) and increase the possibility of leaks to the press corps (as if, ditto). ''one group thinks headquarters should be wherever is easiest for her, and another group is worried about public perception, since washington is an unpopular place,'' said an adviser who has been involved in the discussions and who insisted on anonymity.

Article 3 - hillary clinton's policy will mean 'generations of terrorism': donald trump | zee news
follow @zeenews fayetteville (us): donald trump has criticised president barack obama and hillary clinton for dragging the us into wars overseas and said the rival presidential candidate's foreign policy would mean ""generations of terrorism"" into american schools, but his plan would put ""america first"". ""(obama and clinton) have dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe and they've left our borders wide open at home,"" he said at an election rally in new hampshire. ""isn't it interesting how we fight for other people's borders, lose the lives, the money - most important are the lives, the great lives. we lose lives, the money, and yet we want to have open borders, right? explain that,"" he said. ""we fight for borders for other countries - half the people never heard of these other countries. they want borders and then we leave our borders open. and they've shipped our jobs and they've shipped our wealth to other countries. to all americans, i say it is time for a new leadership,"" trump said. the criticism came as trump and clinton blitzed the battleground states yesterday, with days to go for the election that will decide the next us president. clinton's long-held lead in new hampshire has collapsed in recent days and nationwide the gap between them has remarkably narrowed to the margin of error in some opinion polls after the fbi revived questions about the democratic nominee

story highlights cnn spoke to hillary clinton supporters in florida, ohio they explain why they support the democratic nominee (cnn) the day after fbi director james comey dropped a grand piano on hillary clinton's campaign, setting off a round of recriminations from top aides and allies, the candidate looked out on a happy-go-lucky assembly of supporters gathered in a small, sticky daytona beach gymnasium. if comey's letter had resurrected the dreaded specter of clinton's emails, her diehards in florida, where she spent most of saturday, were openly untroubled. they dutifully jeered comey's name as clinton called his decision and its timing ""pretty strange,"" but roared when she pivoted back to her usual fare -- a promise to keep ""focused on one thing, you and your families."" apart from the quick round of booing, the crowd here had little to say about the campaign's new bête noire. minutes away from the historically black bethune-cookman university, this was a safe space. her supporters in this coastal city -- the kind of quiet loyalists who could vault her to the white house next week -- didn't just take the fbi news in stride, they mostly strode right past it. retired veteran walter browning, his ""operation iraqi freedom"" cap tipped up high on his head, strained to explain just how little he cared.

Article 5 - how will the world change after the election? magazine
american intelligence officials are used to forecasting how foreign elections will affect the united states. but whatever would foreign prognosticators make of hillary clinton, donald trump, and the world of november 9 and beyond? we asked some of the smartest spies and analysts we know to turn the tables and imagine they were the national intelligence council dissecting the 2016 election as if the united states were a foreign country. what are the global scenarios or surprising international incidents a president clinton could face—or precipitate? how would america’s role in the world be different from what we’ve seen under president obama? and what happens if donald trump pulls off a win? story continued below on october 25, these four global intelligence specialists—including former nic and cia officials—gathered for a forecasting exercise moderated by politico editor susan glasser. while trump was talking about a “rigged” election and clinton was making a push into red states, the group cast their eyes toward serious international challenges that have largely been ignored on the campaign trail: from the north korean nuclear threat to the future of europe post-brexit, vladimir putin’s designs on the middle east to the collapse of venezuela—and more. here’s the conversation they had, condensed and lightly edited. *** susan glasser: it seems like people are already turning their attention, in many ways, to november 9 and beyond. but everybody feels intuitively that this election is not

Article 6 - the new york senate race
hillary clinton is running in a phantom race for the senate, pitted against an unknown, unqualified opponent. in the unlikely event that new yorkers ever learn what john spencer’s views are, most would find them far too conservative. it’s a measure of the haplessness of mr. spencer’s campaign that the republican nominee has been dogged by rumors that his real aim is to prepare the ground for an attempt to regain his old job as mayor of yonkers. it would be easy to endorse hillary clinton for a second term even if she had a far more credible opponent. mrs. clinton has been an excellent senator — hard-working and in close touch with her state. we have been particularly impressed by her focus on the neglected “first suburbs” of aging housing and decaying infrastructure. as a democrat, she has a limited ability to influence legislation, but she has taken a lead in forming the debate on a number of issues of substance. her bill aimed at fixing the mechanics of voting set the standard for election reform legislation. watching mrs. clinton do her job, we have been impressed by her mastery of even the most obscure details of new york’s problems. her ability to work with republicans has been a pleasant surprise. she has won the genuine respect of most of her colleagues in washington, and she seems to have found a forum in which her lifelong wonkishness can be put to good use. it seems as if in the senate

Article 7 - hillary in 2016? not so fast
and some of the ways in which she stands out from the lot aren’t flattering. she comes with a more tangled political history of gifts bestowed, favors owed, ironclad allegiances and ancient feuds than almost any possible competitor does. we’ve had frequent reminders of that: in the anthony weiner saga; in reports of mismanagement at the clinton foundation ; in coverage of terry mcauliffe ’s bid to become virginia ’s governor. we’ve also had glimpses of the clintons as an entrenched, entitled ruling class. to a degree that has turned off even some of the couple’s loyalists, bill and hillary have been unabashed lately in their coronation of chelsea as the clinton in waiting, the heir to the throne. they renamed the family’s foundation to give her billing equal to theirs, with hillary telling new york magazine that chelsea’s elevation was “in the dna.” they tug chelsea onto pedestal after pedestal, tucking her into the folds of their own glory. photo and it works. in an interview in september, piers morgan asked bill clinton whether hillary or chelsea would make the better president. “over the long run, chelsea,” bill said. “she knows more than we do about everything.” such dynastic musings square oddly with what’s shaping up as an anti-establishment passage of american politics, and the clintons’ overexposure is a dicey fit

Article 8 - paris attacks complicate hillary clinton’s alignment with obama
mrs. clinton’s campaign has said for months that it sees no reason to break with mr. obama. mrs. clinton has instead positioned her agenda around plans to “build on the progress” of the obama administration. in places like south carolina where african-american voters, in particular, overwhelmingly support the president, mrs. clinton devotes much of her stump speech to effusively praising mr. obama’s success in reviving the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. in a new york times/cbs news survey released last thursday, 79 percent of democrats said they were satisfied or very satisfied with mr. obama’s presidency, and 60 percent said they would like to see the next president continue his policies. but the renewed emphasis on terrorism in the past few days has laid bare mrs. clinton’s long-held differences with mr. obama on foreign policy and when the united states should intervene in conflicts abroad. for four years as secretary of state, mrs. clinton played a prominent role in nearly every foreign policy issue of mr. obama’s first term, often pushing the white house to embrace a more aggressive approach. she urged the administration to join a nato-led coalition to oust col. muammar el-qaddafi in libya, proposed that more forces be left in iraq and pushed to funnel arms to moderate syrian rebels. “i assume she and her advisers are trying to cal

Additionally, the summary contains claims such as the concept of ""the spirit of man"" being a divine presence formed by God within each individual at conception, which is not mentioned in the article. The article's focus on paganism and its symbolism is completely absent from the summary, indicating that it is likely FAKE NEWS.","Ancient mythologies and symbolism are still present in contemporary life. The concept of the ""spirit of man"" is described as a divine presence formed by God within each individual at conception, not an immortal soul. This idea is supported by biblical references such as Zechariah 12:1.

Egyptian decorative motifs include symbols like the cobra, cow, and scarab, which hold significant meaning in ancient Egyptian art and culture. The use of symbolism played a crucial role in establishing order and maintaining power.

The Vatican City's ""Holy See"" is shrouded in secrecy, with some believing it to be controlled by a shadowy cult that practices bloodthirsty rituals and demonic worship. This cult claims to have originated from the Roman Empire's Pontifex Maximus title.

Ancient gods like Bacchus, associated with wine and ecstasy, were often depicted as having died and been reborn. The story of his death is linked to the Greek goddess Hera's treachery.

The Anunnaki, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, allegedly mined gold on Earth using a ""washboard"" method. This theory suggests that the gods destroyed most living creatures with a flood, which was carefully planned by the Anunnaki.

A secretive culture exists within the New World Order, where silence is essential to maintaining power and influence. This doctrine of secrecy has its roots in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece.

One article features a 16th-century helmet made by Filippo Negroli, adorned with gilded curls and steel ears, which symbolizes the king's identity and place in the world. Another article describes giant bronze frog sculptures on Willimantic's new bridge, weighing one ton each, created by sculptor Leo Jensen.

A third article explores Indian art, highlighting a 17th-century ivory sculpture of a man and woman from Madurai, showcasing the blending of sacred and secular themes. The article also mentions the work of artist Budd Hopkins, who became known for his alien-abduction movement.

Other articles discuss American art, including paintings on robes worn by Plains Indians, which tell stories of oral history and epic adventure. Additionally, research on biophilia reveals that people have a natural affinity for nature, but also experience fear and anxiety when confronted with it.

The articles also touch on the concept of art as decoration, rather than spirituality or mystery. One artist, Flavin, is quoted as saying that his work is about ""shedding its vaunted mystery"" and delivering a common sense of keenly realized decoration. The articles conclude by highlighting the importance of everyday, secular art in understanding history.

isis is (before it's news) isis is when i was young i would always sneak off to the library and one of my favorite book series was called man, myth and magic. i would read each volume cover to cover and it is for this reason i am able to see the world in a very interesting light. i see old mythologies manifest in contemporary life and i really don’t care if others don’t, but it’s fun to point out the coincidences. i also have read joseph campbell and most of his views have also changed my views on how classic mythological memes do have an effect on contemporary life. just last year a posthumous compilation of joseph campbell’s views on the influence of the divine feminine in mythology was released. as dr. laura kern noted in her review of the book, ‘goddesses’, what is fascinating is campbell’s description of the impact of the suppression of the feminine divine by semitic mythologies, and how this changed both mythology and the world: “and so, with these masculine semitic mythologies, we have for the first time a separation of the individual from the divine, and this is one of the most important and decisive motifs in the history of mythology: that the eternal life and oneness with the universe are no longer ours. we are separated from god, god is separated from his world, man is turned against nature, nature is turned against man” (p. 86). then he

Article 2 - ancient egyptian motifs
(before it's news) ancient egyptian decorative motifs were following reasons: cobra, cow, feather flower, geometric, hathor, scarab, sphinx and stars. in addition, they have different types of borders. the lotus flower is the symbol of the sun and creation. symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. symbolism, ranging from the pharaoh’s regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) the different symbols of egyptian gods and goddesses, was omnipresent in egyptian art.animals are often also highly symbolic figures in egyptian art. ancient egyptian motifs color, and had wide sense – blue and green represented the nile and life, the yellow represents the sun god, and red represented power and vitality. despite the elevated form caused by a lack of perspective, ancient egyptian art is often very realistic. ancient egyptian artists often show a thorough knowledge of anatomy and attention to detail, especially in their interpretations of animals. the eye of horus symbol was used in funerary rites and decoration, as described in the egyptian book of the dead. therefore, the sacred eye can also function as a symbol of the offer. scarabs were worn as jewelry and amulets in ancient egypt. the heart scarab, which were hieroglyphic inscriptions on the back, was often buried with the dead to ensure the rebirth of the deceased in the afterlife.

Article 3 - the “spirit of man” – do you know what that “spirit” is?
the “spirit of man” – do you know what that “spirit” is? headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! the spirit – “of” – man this truth found in the word of god will be quickly rejected by “nominal” christians — it invalidates all their doctrines. the “spirit – of – man” is –not — an immortal ‘soul’, – but “spirit” formed by god “within” each of us at conception. zechariah 12: 1 1 “the burden of the word of the lord for israel, saith the lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, —- — and — formeth – the spirit – “of” – man –“within him”. god forms an individual “human spirit” which is then placed “in” each human fetus at the moment of conception. each “spirit of man” is uniquely individual – there are no two alike. just as god does not make humans identical copies – one like another, no ‘spirit’ is like another. god the father is creating each one of us as his “masterpiece”: each of us is a one of a kind work of art. god despises “widgets” mass produced by a “cookie cutter” assemble line. god, even down to the fine details reject sameness even to the point that the finger prints of twins all are different one from the

Article 4 - the internet post
the vatican city is the heart of the catholic church and the pope (pontifex maximus) is the head of the church and the supreme “spiritual” leader of all of the world’s catholics. but the vatican hides some of the darkest secrets one can imagine. sedes sacrorum – etymology sedes sacrorum (latin for holy seat), known as the holy see in english, is the seal of the vatican city state. sedes sacrorum (ss) “the roman cult* which controls the catholic church maintains that the first person to use the concept of the holy see was st. peter. this of course, is impossible as the etymology of the word “sedes” (see) and its associated meaning were not in existence until hundreds of years after the execution of st. peter in 70 ce at the siege of jerusalem.” [1] *the roman cult is a shadow group of blood-thirsty satanists, which was involved in “child sacrifice, burning people alive (since 11th century ce), demonic worship and absolute celibacy of its lowest priests. since the 1st century bce, its high priests known as ‘pontiffs’ — a hereditary position controlled by a handful of ancient families — claimed the ancient pre-republic title of pontifex maximus after the roman emperors assumed themselves as high priest of the state cult of magna mater (cybele).

Article 5 - the god of wine and ecstasy
the god of wine and ecstasy headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! since bread and wine are traditionally bound together as symbols of life-giving nourishment from the gods, it is not surprising that demeter, the goddess of the grain, was often worshipped together with bacchus, the god of wine. like other gods of vegetation bacchus was believed to have died a violent death, but to have been brought back to life again. zeus’ wife, the goddess hera, hated this child born of a human mother and plotted his destruction. knowing how she felt, zeus entrusted young bacchus to the care of guards that he thought he could trust. hera, however, bribed the guards, and by amusing the boy with a mirror – which he stared into, becoming fascinated with his own image – she lured him underground into a trap. the titans, his grandparents’ generation whom zeus had defeated in a great war and imprisoned in the earth, were now co-conspirators with hera. they ambushed the boy, tore him to pieces, boiled his flesh, and ate it. but athena, the goddess of wisdom, who had shared in hera’s treachery, now repented and saved the boy’s heart. she brought it to zeus, and confessed the whole sordid story. enraged, zeus blasted the titans with a mighty thunderbolt, reducing them to ashes

Article 6 - nephilim, annunaki and monoatomic gold with marshall klarfeld
nephilim, annunaki and monoatomic gold with marshall klarfeld (before it's news) the anunnaki were here!, marshall’s most recent book clearly demonstrating the theory of “washboard gold mining” by the advanced extraterrestrial civilization, the anunnaki. when proven, this theory will turn the ancient archaeological community upside down! we will look for the reason why the gods destroyed most living creatures on earth by a flood, a disaster carefully planned by the gods. as discussed in chapter 3 and 4, most of the “players” who deserved their punishment are already know to us. after their descent to earth, the watchers indulged in earthly delights with their chosen “wives”, through these unions were born giant offspring named as nephilim a hebrew word meaning ‘those who have fallen’, which rendered in greek translations as gigantes, or “giants”. another mistake made by “the church fathers” and the jews, was that they forgot to erase the verses that contains stories of gods, angels and watchers. maybe they could not translate these “scrolls” any other way. my question still remain “what is left over of monotheism ?”. as the reader knows i’m sure that the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha books should be part of the “new” bible, but they are and will not be added because the stories in these books don’t fit in the monotheism theory of

Article 7 - the doctrine of silence in the new world order
the doctrine of silence in the new world order (before it's news) the doctrine of silence in the new world order one of the primary difficulties in discerning the actions of the current shapers of the new world order is in understanding the secretive culture that gave rise to their worldview. forged in the exclusive doctrines of the occult and socialized in elite clubs, the doctrine of secrecy is essential to the exercise and preservation of power and influence. this doctrine of silence is not of recent invention; its provenance reaches back into past civilizations. egypt the egyptians had their own god of silence: haar-poor-kraat, a god-form of horus. this god-form has always been depicted with the right hand placed toward the mouth with one finger over the lips in a gesture of silence. har-poor-kraat the egyptian god-form of horus, the god of the sun. greece the greeks had their own god of silence as well: harpocrates, a version of the egyptian god of silence. this god-form was similarly depicted as his egyptian counterpart, with the right hand placed toward the mouth and one finger over the lips in a gesture of silence. harpocrates, the greek god of silence. the hellfire club (1752-1766) in the late 18th century, sir francis dashwood organized an elite group of english lords and other elites for drink and debauchery in the

Article 8 - witchcraft before wicca: the cunning men and wise-women of old
witchcraft before wicca: the cunning men and wise-women of old headline: bitcoin & blockchain searches exceed trump! blockchain stocks are next! photograph of english cunning man george pickingill, taken at the turn of the 20th century, in either the 1890s or early 1900s. by michael howard (1948–2015) today the popular image of witchcraft in the mass media and in books and magazines is largely defined by ‘wicca’, a form of neo-pagan witchcraft created by a retired english civil servant called gerald brosseau gardner (1884–1964) in the 1940s. it is now established worldwide as a post-modern, ‘nature religion’ with a spiritual emphasis on goddess worship. modern witchcraft, however, did not begin with gardner and it has a hidden history before wicca. this history has connections with the famous occultist aleister crowley and also with australia. from the 1800s onwards there were several revivals of witchcraft in britain based on historical precedents. these forms of pre-wiccan witchcraft are variously known today as traditional witchcraft or ‘traditional craft’, the ‘old craft’ or ‘elder craft’, the ‘sabbatic craft’, ‘the nameless arte’, and ‘the crooked path’. there is also plenty of evidence from historical sources, folklore accounts, court cases and, later, newspaper reports

Article 1 - it’s a beautiful fit, but can you breathe in there, your majesty?
the first piece in the exhibition, displayed in a vitrine like a religious relic in an otherwise nearly empty room, doubles as a helmet for, and portrait of, charles v. made by filippo negroli of milan, the pre-eminent armorer of the 16th century, it has gilded curls and a beard matching the king’s real hair and delicately formed ears and lips of steel. a visor, now missing, might have represented charles’s eyes and nose, which brings up a significant point: while a full suit of armor hides the identity of its wearer, its exterior tells much about who he was and his place in the world. photo charles v’s helmet, for example, has an embossed victor’s wreath encircling it, suggesting a connection to the emperors of ancient rome. it also has a neckpiece bearing a low-relief representation of the necklace of the chivalric order of the golden fleece, to which only the most powerful of european rulers belonged. a real golden fleece necklace is displayed nearby. made mostly of gold, it has a small golden figure of a ram hanging by a rope tied around its middle. no other helmet or suit in the exhibition is so personal. the symbolism of other outfits alludes to broader concepts or systems like christianity, chivalry, roman history, and greek and roman mythology. the personal disappears into the universal as the iconography affirms the king’s cosmically

Article 2 - once again, frogs land in willimantic
a quartet of giant bluish-green frog sculptures has taken up residence on the massive cement thread spools mounted on willimantic's new bridge across the willimantic river. thread city crossing, as the graceful arched bridge is known, combines the city's two enduring symbols: thread and bullfrogs. the four bronze amphibians, by the sculptor leo jensen of ivoryton, weigh one ton each and measure about 12 feet from tip of toe to top of nostril. their bluish-green color comes from a finish that mimics bronze patina, an ''instant weathering'' according to the bridge architect, william h. grover. they will become a little greener, he said, as they stay outdoors longer, gradually turning to a natural amphibian green. their eyes glow from an application of thin gold leaf. frogs have symbolized the city of willimantic since the mid-1700's. a legend, told in the book, ''legendary connecticut'' (curbstone press, 1984) by david phillips, an eastern connecticut state university professor, inspired the frog motif. advertisement continue reading the main story mr. phillips wrote that city residents were awakened by a fierce noise. according to the legend, many men were off fighting in the french and indian war, so it was women, children and some elderly residents who fled from the noise into the woods. the indians, whom they suspected of

Article 3 - beyond the cacophony of india to realms of princes and gods
the thing is, indian art doesn't stick to categories. sacred and secular are often interchangeable; so are high and low, local and subcontinental. this is demonstrated in the remarkable object that opens the show, a 17th-century ivory sculpture of a man and a woman from the south indian temple city of madurai. the figures are nude from the waist up, shapely in an untoned way and adorned with jewels. the man, slightly taller, caresses the woman's chin. she leans against him, touching his arm and head. their big, protuberant, wide-open eyes convey a bright if unfocused alertness, making the couple seem psychologically very there, but also far away. who are these people? madurai newlyweds? a ruler and his queen? are they people at all? maybe they are divine or mythological beings like rama and sita. or versions of the symbolic ""loving couples"" that cover temples throughout india, turning them into auspicious monuments to fertility. in a culture in which kings can be gods, gods can be all too human, and sensuality and spirituality are intimately linked, they could fit any of the identities noted above. once you grasp the notion that, in this cosmic scheme, heaven and earth form a jumpy continuum, the show's division into sacred and secular halves feels a lot more elastic. and the presence in both sections of identical types of images -- elaborately crowned princes, gorgeous women, a

Article 4 - budd hopkins, abstract expressionistartist, dies at 80
budd hopkins, a distinguished abstract expressionist artist who -- after what he described as a chance sighting of something flat, silver, airborne and unfathomable -- became the father of the alien-abduction movement, died on aug. 21 at his home in manhattan. he was 80. the cause was complications of cancer, his daughter, grace hopkins-lisle, said. a painter and sculptor, mr. hopkins was part of the circle of new york artists that in the 1950s and '60s included mark rothko, robert motherwell and franz kline. his work -- which by the late '60s included mondrian-like paintings of huge geometric forms anointed with flat planes of color -- is in the collections of the metropolitan museum of art and the museum of modern art in new york, the corcoran gallery of art in washington and the british museum, among others. in later years mr. hopkins turned to large, quasi-architectural sculptures that seemed to spring from primordial myths. in 1985, reviewing one such piece, ''temple of apollo with guardian xxxxv'' -- it was part house of worship, part archaeological ruin, part sacrificial altar -- michael brenson wrote in the new york times: ''if the work is about sacrifice and violence, it is also about ecstasy and illumination. in the course of trying to re-establish the broadest meaning of the abstract geometry that has fascinated

Article 5 - review: ‘the plains indians,’ america’s early artists, at the met
with the arrival of europeans on the plains, life began to change. spanish soldiers and ranchers, coming north from mexico in the 16th century, introduced horses, which indians quickly adopted, mastered and bred. horses dramatically extended the range and efficiency of the buffalo hunt, a primary source of food and of hides for clothing and shelter. plains people became increasingly mobile, moving seasonally with the herds and carrying their lives with them. portability became a requisite, and never has the genre of art-you-can-wear been more inventively explored. painted robes, covered with figures and symbols and accessorized with leggings and gloves, became storyboards of oral history and epic adventure. one monumental example from the branly collection, fittingly known as the grand robe, depicts, in more than a dozen episodes and with a cast of some 60 figures, the homeric exploits of two lakota warriors. there are debates over the gender of the artists of certain robes. but in general, paintings and drawings were done by men, and tanning, sewing and beadwork by women. and outstanding examples of beadwork, positioned throughout the show, glow with a kind of self-generated light. an early-19th-century man’s shirt from the upper missouri river region, on loan from a museum in bern , switzerland , is sewn with just a few glass beads, like a sprinkling of fresh rain. a central plains woman’s dress, from around 1855,

Article 6 - adoring nature, till it bites us in the back
and all of these messy, contradictory feelings are natural. in the two decades since dr. wilson published ''biophilia,'' many other researchers have explored the meaning of nature-lust, and its components, and the extent to which we are possessed by it. they have found evidence of biophilia everywhere. americans are said to be sports nuts, for example, yet more people in this country attend zoos every year than they do all professional sporting events combined. of the many luxuries that money can buy, the most coveted has long been a pristine view: lakeside, seaside, mountainside, central park. ''people don't realize that new york has a larger proportion of its real estate in open spaces than any other major city,'' said dr. stephen r. kellert, a professor of social ecology at yale and a leading figure in the biophilia field. yet biophilia researchers also recognize that biophilia enfolds biophobia, a fear of being sucked down and overwhelmed by too much nature. guns, cars, bombs and electric wires can be deadly, but when moviemakers want to really horrify an audience, nothing works like a giant tarantula on james bond's shoulder, or a pit of writhing snakes beneath the feet of indiana jones. ''by the biophilia hypothesis, nature affects us negatively as well as positively,'' said dr. peter verbeek, a professor of psychology at miyazaki international college in japan. ''one

Article 7 - to be enlightened, you pull the switch
his subject was emphatically the present, each work being different when experienced one place or another. the light fixtures themselves were nearly beside the point, by which i mean they weren't things you could stare at easily; they resisted standard connoisseurship. if you flipped off the electric switch they effectively stopped being art. they were like duchamp's readymades in that respect (and only in that respect), becoming art by virtue of being declared so because of their placement in a gallery or museum. from this strategy, flavin extracted unexpected variety and eloquence, as the exhibition reminds us. he exemplified a larger truth, that all serious artists, minimalists or otherwise, usually thrive on parameters. ""it is what it is and it ain't nothing else,"" flavin said about his work. ""everything is clearly, openly, plainly delivered. there is no overwhelming spirituality you are supposed to come into contact with."" he added: ""i believe art is shedding its vaunted mystery for a common sense of keenly realized decoration."" that may have been his outlook, but spirituality and mystery are precisely what many people extract from his works, the inevitable reaction to intangible light as a religious motif, passed down in history through countless pictures. it was inherited by this former altar boy from brooklyn, who fondly recalled the ritual of the mass as ""rich in candlelight, music, chant, vestments, processions and incense."" flavin's point wasn't exactly to

Article 8 - russian city's sacred and secular visions
the ultimate source of that art was constantinople, the capital of byzantium. yet by the time its fine-grained imperial styles reached russia, they had picked up all kinds of other styles -- slavic, asian, western european -- along the way. the result was a hybrid aesthetic, with distinctive flair and refinements. the same was true of novgorod's secular art, which had roots in local, pagan soil. secular art accounts for roughly half the show. and over all, it is the sort of dug-up, beat-up everyday stuff that used to land on the archaeological scrap heap rather than in the nice, clean art museums. for understanding history such material is indispensable, of course. worth noting is that a lot of it is also beautiful. certainly that's true of some of the jewelry here: a jazzy necklace of colored glass beads, possibly from the near east; a silver necklace with a scandinavian twist; and a cast bronze pendant of a two-headed horse with tinkling chimes for feet. from farther down in the city's ancient strata come 10th-century coins minted in england, flanders, france and germany, suggesting the geographic reach of novgorod's enterprise. but most revealing of all are personal items: slippers, toys, musical instruments and, extraordinarily, letters written on birch-bark strips. in one letter, dating from the mid-12th century, a monk apologizes to a tick

Title: horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god
Content: horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god (before it's news) interview with raven grimassi brought to you by red wheel weiser books. 1. what made you decide to update and revise frederick thomas elworthy’s horns of honor regarding the spirit of the pagan horned god? this came about from a discussion with my publisher and a shared vision of creating something of increased value for the pagan community. in modern times the major emphasis is on “the goddess” and there is little material solely focused on “the god” in paganism. in this regard, the goal was to introduce a book from the perspective of achieving a balanced view of the other half of the divine in modern paganism. 2. would you share with us some thoughts on the pagan horned god? to me, the pagan image of the masculine polarity of divinity represents the primal force of nature that was venerated by our ancestors. this image arises from the animal kingdom, and in this way unites us with something closer to the natural order of things. the horned god is divinity “untamed” by human design, and is the liberator as opposed to idea of a controlling “god” as envisioned in mainstream religions. 3. being a capricorn i seem to have an affinity for all things horny. ha. such as pan and cernunnos. what can you share with us about these two from the horned pantheon? pan is a concept that reflects fertility and the untamed nature of things. cernunnos, in a sense, is the spirit of the forest, but is also a guide of the dead. this latter theme separates him from pan. to a degree, cernunnos is more refined in comparison to pan, and can be thought of an evolved form of the more idea. 4. could you go into what the chapter horns of the devil embodies and imparts knowledge wise? i feel that the core message is about the contrived image of the judaic-christian devil appearing in the likeness of the pagan god. here we see the sacred profaned by the agenda of the church in its vilification of a rival religion. depicting the devil in pagan imagery was part of an attempt to use fear in order to draw people away from the old gods. converting people to one religion from another is easier when you can make the rival religion seem dangerous or connected to something undesirable. 5. would you go into some ancient cultures where horns play a significant role that some may not be familiar with? as the book indicates, the use of horns and their veneration in the context of gods and animal is widespread across the planet. it’s the persistence into modern times that is truly noteworthy. one example is the “horn dance” at abbots bromley in stafforshire, which features a procession of men carrying antlers. they are accompanied by a musician, a boy holding a triangle

RELIABLE NEWS SUMMARY
---------------------
A collection of articles discusses various art pieces and exhibitions. One article features a 16th-century helmet made by Filippo Negroli, adorned with gilded curls and steel ears, which symbolizes the king's identity and place in the world. Another article describes giant bronze frog sculptures on Willimantic's new bridge, weighing one ton each, created by sculptor Leo Jensen.

A third article explores Indian art, highlighting a 17th-century ivory sculpture of a man and woman from Madurai, showcasing the blending of sacred and secular themes. The article also mentions the work of artist Budd Hopkins, who became known for his alien-abduction movement.

Other articles discuss American art, including paintings on robes worn by Plains Indians, which tell stories of oral history and epic adventure. Additionally, research on biophilia reveals that people have a natural affinity for nature, but also experience fear and anxiety when confronted with it.

The articles also touch on the concept of art as decoration, rather than spirituality or mystery. One artist, Flavin, is quoted as saying that his work is about ""shedding its vaunted mystery"" and delivering a common sense of keenly realized decoration. The articles conclude by highlighting the importance of everyday, secular art in understanding history.

Key themes include the blending of sacred and secular themes, the power of nature to inspire both positive and negative emotions, and the concept of art as decoration rather than spirituality.

FAKE NEWS SUMMARY
-----------------
Ancient mythologies and symbolism are still present in contemporary life. The concept of the ""spirit of man"" is described as a divine presence formed by God within each individual at conception, not an immortal soul. This idea is supported by biblical references such as Zechariah 12:1.

Egyptian decorative motifs include symbols like the cobra, cow, and scarab, which hold significant meaning in ancient Egyptian art and culture. The use of symbolism played a crucial role in establishing order and maintaining power.

The Vatican City's ""Holy See"" is shrouded in secrecy, with some believing it to be controlled by a shadowy cult that practices bloodthirsty rituals and demonic worship. This cult claims to have originated from the Roman Empire's Pontifex Maximus title.

Ancient gods like Bacchus, associated with wine and ecstasy, were often depicted as having died and been reborn. The story of his death is linked to the Greek goddess Hera's treachery.

The Anunnaki, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, allegedly mined gold on Earth using a ""washboard"" method. This theory suggests that the gods destroyed most living creatures with a flood, which was carefully planned by the Anunnaki.

A secretive culture exists within the New World Order, where silence is essential to maintaining power and influence. This doctrine of secrecy has its roots in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Greece.

Historical records show that pre-Wiccan witchcraft existed in Britain from the
